Surely, this has significantly hindered MessageBird\u2019s growth so far?", "\u201cIn our case, we saw customers using us for SMS and just not using us for voice because we didn\u2019t offer it before,\u201d said Vis. \u201cThe need for the voice API really is driven by our customers, who wanted us to provide the same global security and cost advantages on voice that we have been doing for SMS for some time now. We are now able to leverage our direct carrier connections on voice as well as SMS. Being bootstrapped teaches you to focus on where the most growth is coming from, and up to now that has always been our SMS products. But the need from our customers was clear \u2014 so we built it.\u201d", "MessageBird claims it has been profitable since its inception and said that it\u2019s on course to hit a $100 million revenue run rate this year.

By way of comparison, Twilio had raised north of $100 million in outside funding by the time it was reporting\u00a0", "a $100 million run rate in 2014", ", and this came shortly before it raised ", "an additional $130 million", ".", "MessageBird said that it already counts 15,000 customers globally, including DoorDash, SAP, Huawei, Amber Alert, and Heineken. One particularly notable name in its roster is Uber, which\u00a0Twilio has long claimed as a client of its own.\u00a0", "But Twilio recently revealed", "\u00a0that Uber was reducing its dependency on Twilio\u2019s technology, a move that caused Twilio\u2019s ", "stock to nosedive", ".", "Anyone who\u2019s ever used Uber will likely take for granted the app\u2019s speedy messaging functionality. You\u2019ll also note that it\u2019s possible to chat verbally with a driver through the app, rather than having to share telephone numbers manually over SMS.", "\u201cThe magic of using cloud communications to power this interaction is that both customer and rider are automatically provided with a virtual number, which means both sides of the call are anonymized,\u201d noted\u00a0Vis. \u201cDriver and customer never see each other\u2019s real number.\u201d", "With tens of millions of users globally, such a system requires a reliable infrastructure, and it\u2019s much easier \u2014 even for heavily funded companies such as Uber \u2014 to outsource some of these service, rather than building it all in-house.", "\u201cWe work with large companies that cannot afford compromised communications,\u201d continued Vis. \u201cThe quality of your communications is a direct reflection on the caliber of your business.

With its own telecommunications carrier infrastructure, MessageBird can \u201cconnect to the very core of mobile carriers,\u201d according to Vis. This effectively bypasses legacy systems that may involve multiple players and which may not be reliable. Generally speaking, the more entities involved in getting a message from A to B, the more likely there will be delays or failures. One analogy Vis used to describe its setup is the game \u201ctelephone\u201d (or \u201c", "Chinese whispers", "\u201d as its known elsewhere), whereby a message is whispered into one person\u2019s ear and then passed along to the next person until the last player in the group repeats a message that is unrecognizable to the initial whisper.", "\u201cThe same holds true for communications,\u201d said Vis. \u201cBecause of our direct carrier connections, MessageBird is essentially whispering in the last person\u2019s ear, bypassing all the people in the middle. Other companies go through all those extra hoops, and as a result security is compromised, quality is diminished, and speed is slowed \u2014 and now imagine you had to pay all those people who passed along the message. That is what happens in communications.\u201d", "One interesting facet of MessageBird\u2019s recent past is its participation in the American seed-stage accelerator program, Y Combinator (YC). Though MessageBird was technically a seed-stage company in terms of funding, YC is generally geared toward early-stage startups \u2014 not companies that are already generating millions in revenue. So what was the story behind the YC tie-up?", "\u201cWe were growing so fast that it afforded us a moment to reflect and fine-tune our vision as to where we wanted to go as a company,\u201d Vis said. \u201cIt also provided us with a huge network of portfolio companies we saw as potential customers in the U.S. market. The way I look at YC, it\u2019s more like Harvard for founders, where they really drill you on focus and basics that apply to companies at any stage.\u201d", "One specific learning that Vis gleaned from his company\u2019s involvement with YC was a mantra stipulating that \u201cgrowth\u201d is about retaining customers, not just acquiring them. \u201cIt seems really logical, but it changed the way we looked at customer success, and we increased our revenue expansion rate from 140 percent prior to YC to 170 percent after it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a huge advocate for companies joining YC at any stage, especially larger companies outside of the U.S. wanting to enter the U.S. market.\u201d", "MessageBird now lays claim to the biggest-ever series A investment for a Y Combinator company.", "\u201cWhile many companies have significant traction when they enter YC, MessageBird was one of the largest companies by revenue to ever complete the program,\u201d added\u00a0Y Combinator partner Ali Rowghani.", "Today, MessageBird has offices in its native Amsterdam, as well as in San Francisco, Singapore, and Sydney. In addition to funding its push into voice, the company said it will use its fresh cash bounty to fund new hires, including in customer support, and to consider acquisition options in the U.S., Europe, and Asia.", "One luxury of being a self-funded startup is that you don\u2019t have to worry about exits \u2014 being acquired or going public doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re getting customers and garnering revenue. While this funding helps MessageBird scale in key markets such as the U.S., doesn\u2019t it also give them an extra problem to worry about?", "\u201cWe specifically chose investors who have a long-term vision and will not put pressure on us to think about this [exiting] for a while,\u201d said Vis. \u201cIt happens to be that ", "both investors", " just ", "raised their investment funds", ", so we are good for the next 10 years to not have to worry about this.

He\u2019s been on a bit of a down slide and Theo is on his way up. We think that\u2019s going to be an interesting match. That also pits Team Echo Fox versus Team Rogue, with Theo being Echo Fox and Slayer being Rogue.", "In the feature matches, we have an interesting one up top. Low Tier God, who everyone considers a streamer, not a pro player, but he\u2019s won his first two fights at Body Count one and two. So we\u2019ve increased his competiton. We\u2019re throwing him against Nick Tanella. This is one where if he wins, he might be due a title shot, which might be interesting for a guy everyone considered more of an influencer or streamer than a pro player. And then Nubcakes against Crazy on the Injustice 2 side, he just took number two this week at a stacked Wednesday night fight card, because all of the players are in Socal.", "He went up in Injustice against the best of the best and came out second. I won\u2019t say it\u2019s out of nowhere, because he\u2019s a good player, but it\u2019s a little bit out of nowhere. He\u2019s on the undercard as well. It should be a good night of fights. Logistically we\u2019re running buses from the Anaheim Convention Center to the esports arena to put fans and players in the building. This is the first time we\u2019re doing it somewhere that\u2019s not in our studio, so we have more capacity for seating. We\u2019ve added food and beverage to the night.", "GamesBeat: I like the setup you have with the fight card and the belts and things like that. Do you know if any other esports organizations are working this way? Or is it typically a team system and tournaments and competitions like that?", "Dimberg:", " By and large what you have in any of the esports are tournament-based systems. The ESL obviously puts on a lot of tournaments and they do a great job of that. This is a different take on the esports equation from us. I think we\u2019re unique in that format. Distribution-wise we\u2019re seeing the publishers get behind it. We just got in\u2014we\u2019re obviously going to be streaming to our own channels for Body Count Fighting, and also our partners at Level Up Series, but also just got confirmation that we\u2019ll be streaming the Tekken portions of the show to Bandai Namco\u2019s Twitch, and the Injustice portions to NetherRealm\u2019s Twitch.", "The publishers themselves are getting behind the format in addition to the players themselves. Again, the players love it. They carry their belts around sometimes at other tournaments. They like that this format puts them and their rivalries, so to speak, front and center.", "They\u2019re frenemies, sometimes minus the \u201cfre\u201d part \u2013 just enemies \u2013 but it\u2019s all in the spirit of good competitions. It allows us to showcase those people who\u2014they say in traditional fighting that styles make fights. In some cases that\u2019s true on the FGC side as well. It\u2019s who they play as, their fighting style, a zoner versus a body fighter. It allows us to tee this up so we have an entertaining night for the fans.", "Arons:", " I feel like something interesting is happening, which is that a\u00a0lot of esports got in the news because League of Legends and Dota 2 have million-dollar cups and arenas full of fans. That\u2019s great, and it definitely became what people started to hear and think about when it comes to esports. [But] what I like is on the other side. What we\u2019ve gone back to is an old-fashioned fighting competition where the people really know each other.They\u2019re in this circuit together.", "At any given time there\u2019s two opposite trends happening \u2013 more people are dieting than ever but ice cream sales have never been higher, things like that. I feel like that\u2019s happening with esports. These massive events are getting bigger, but there\u2019s also this other side of the competition that we\u2019re supporting, which is back to how video games began in the arcades. Guys standing around playing each other.", "Dimberg:", " I think an unintended consequence of what we\u2019re doing, long term\u2014I do see the players really latching on to this format. I think they like it. But it changes the way they train a bit. Here you have one night, one opponent, and you know it well in advance usually. You know what their mains are, the characters they play with, so you can train and prepare for a specific opponent. As opposed to entering a tournament where you don\u2019t know who you\u2019re going to play from round to round necessarily. The winners of those tournaments, with some exception\u2014I think of guys like Sonic Fox in Injustice 2, who just seem to win everything because they\u2019re that good. But by and large players catch hot streaks just like any athlete.", "Tournaments show who is hottest at the time. In this case what we hope to get to is\u2014it\u2019s me versus him or her. I know in advance. I\u2019m going to train and prepare for that person. It raises the personal stakes for them a bit, because they put time and energy into training to meet this known opponent, who they pretty well know as far as who they\u2019re going to play as and what their fighting style is. It changes the dynamic a bit. You spend a long period of time preparing for one fight. Which I think will raise some of the drama as we go on.", "GamesBeat: I can see the value in that for sure. Can I ask, how do you make sure it doesn\u2019t end up feeling like a gimmick? I don\u2019t think the way you present it feels like a gimmick, but it can come across a bit like American Gladiators or WWE, something people don\u2019t take too seriously. Are folks taking it seriously? What are you guys doing to facilitate that?", "Dimberg:", " Absolutely. I think the players themselves absolutely take it seriously. They look at it as a pride thing, right? But the American Gladiators thing versus WWE\u2014I\u2019ll say very clearly that the competition is absolutely real. I\u2019d say UFC is a better proxy. The competition is real. What I do talk to the fighters and the players about is that, to use the UFC analogy, Conor MacGregor is the biggest personality in that sport. He happens to be really good, but he also has a fiery personality that draws a lot of people to him who aren\u2019t necessarily always UFC fans, but they just can\u2019t take their eyes off this guy.", "So there is something to be said for being good, but also being charismatic. We do work on those sorts of things. In terms of their fighting, again, we invite them on. We talk to them about how they train. We showcase, again, if you look at things like the Chasing the Cup series, we show the amount of time these players put into this. A lot of these guys, it\u2019s not uncommon for them to practice 12-14 hours a day. I\u2019m someone who\u2019s very much an avid gamer, but I can\u2019t imagine playing one game 12-14 hours a day.", "There\u2019s a mental fortitude that goes into that training that I don\u2019t quite get. I can\u2019t fathom it. We try, at every turn, to showcase that this just isn\u2019t some guys who sat down and grabbed a controller while we threw spotlights on them. These guys work hard and train to perfect their craft. Most of them are sponsored. This is their profession. This is what they do for a living. In the format we\u2019re providing we give them an opportunity to showcase their skills against someone else who\u2019s probably training as hard and is as professional, to see who comes out on top.", "Ultimately what we hope to gather from that is there\u2019s more drama in this sort of format for the end viewer, while still maintaining the level of competition and need to train and prepare for the fighter. Again, it was just trying to see\u2014I\u2019ll use something I said earlier. To promote a good fight, to bring an audience into a fight, is obviously hitting the fans. What I hope to do with this is broaden the top of the funnel for the FGC. Build drama and story that pulls in people who don\u2019t normally or wouldn\u2019t necessarily give an esports competition a second look.", "When we talk internally I talk a lot about the moneymaker effect in poker circa 2004. Unnamed, anonymous online player wins the World Series of Poker and ratings for ESPN explode. What I\u2019m hoping is to put things in a format that can breed that sort of hope for the FGC. The bigger it gets, the better it gets for all of them: the more exposure they get, the more audiences watching their fights, the more prize money potentially at stake, the more sponsor dollars potentially at stake, it helps build the business for them too.", "GamesBeat: Is that where the docu-series comes in? You can help these people build up themselves and the fights simultaneously. Telling the story isn\u2019t just flavoring on top of the competition broadcast. It\u2019s crucial to the way this works. Is that correct?", "Dimberg:", " Yeah, absolutely. Again, most esports competitions come out of either long-standing tournaments, where you see things like EVO, where the most popular event is a 15-year-old Nintendo game, or on the FPS side it\u2019s games like Counter-Strike and games that have been around for a long time.", "It\u2019s not necessarily about moving units of new games, although you see that happening more as we add to it. In the case of Street Fighter and Tekken and Marvel Vs. Capcom\u2014Injustice is in its second iteration. These games have been around for a while. It\u2019s maybe new versions of them, but these guys have been playing these games for in some cases\u2013if you think about Street Fighter that goes back a long time. They\u2019ve been playing for a long time, and there\u2019s quite a community built up around fans, but again, how do I get\u2014sometimes I think this is an odd statement, but how would I get my wife, who\u2019s not a gamer, interested in watching one of these things?", "Tapping into the players helps make it more accessible for someone like her, as an example, but insert anybody who doesn\u2019t necessarily get into gaming or watch esports.", "It\u2019s something we\u2019re committed to long term. I\u2019m planning on doing 12 of these next year in 2018, one every month. They\u2019ve been successful enough, and the fighters have been engaged enough, that I think we\u2019re taking this from something\u2013we were planting a seed and hoping it worked, and now it\u2019s full-fledged, baked in our strategy for 2018. We\u2019re looking to do many more of these over the course of the next 12 to 18 months, moving them to a monthly cadence.", "Arons:", " And keep partnering with people who are really deep into this space.", "Country required", "*By checking this box, you are confirming you are an adult 18 years or older and you agree to Intel contacting you with marketing-related emails or by telephone.

I see fishing stuff all over the place.", "Gan:", " Fishing is really, really important because in fishing, you\u2019re not only fishing, but you have to put them in your own fish farm. They\u2019re different sizes, and you need them to travel around. It\u2019s an island, so to travel to some other places, some mysterious places, you need to breed and cultivate your own fish that are large enough \u2014 L size or XL size \u2014 so that you can ride them and off you go to explore the ocean, places like other islands. That\u2019s very important to the game.", "GamesBeat: Why did you decide fishing would be about both catching and raising fish?", "Gan:", " We love simulation games from when we were young. We were thinking, everyone\u2019s doing fishing. Harvest Moon had a fish farm, but you\u2019d just get a fish and dump it in your well. I can\u2019t remember which title it was, but it was definitely one of the Harvest Moons. You\u2019d breed the fish in your well, but you couldn\u2019t see them. There were just more fish. We wanted to take that to another level, where you could catch fish and breed different sizes and cultivate them. Maybe you could find a mystery egg that would hatch into a Magnus underwater.", "Spokesperson:", " It helps bridge into a bunch of features because it\u2019s also a game where you can go out and explore a lot. Having this fish-raising mechanic allows you to use those fish and explore the islands. I\u2019ve been describing this game as a sort of all-encompassing simulation RPG because it does so much, but I think it\u2019s really fitting that raising these fish then allows you to engage in so many more features.

He applies that computer history to the idea of cloud rendering. Rendering images or games is what happens when you submit your graphics or animation project, and the big computer, in this case a data center, goes to work on it. If you\u2019re like Pixar, you might wait a whole day for your next animated movie scene to come back as a full rendering. Pixar can afford to pay for that, but smaller game makers and animators can\u2019t.", "That\u2019s where blockchain comes in, and it\u2019s why Urbach is starting an Initial Coin Offering for what he calls a ", "Render Token", ". It\u2019s a blockchain-based currency that people can invest in, as it represents a distributed graphics processing unit (GPU) rendering network. Everyone with a computer can contribute the spare cycles to a collective rendering machine, when their computers aren\u2019t being used. Artists can submit their work to be rendered, and then they\u2019ll get their job done.", "The Render Token ICO kicks off on October 5. And if it works, then it will be like a brave new world, where people contribute their spare compute cycles to the cause and earn something from it. I talked to Urbach about this big idea.", "Here\u2019s an edited transcript of our interview.", "VentureBeat: Do you want to talk about why you\u2019re going the ICO route, and explain what Render is as part of that?", "Jules Urbach:", " Render is a way of solving a problem that I foresaw years ago. There\u2019s a patent from 2009 that reflected my view. The idea behind the token sale is something that I was thinking about well before I knew anything about the state of cryptocurrency and Bitcoin and Ethereum and all these ideas that have come out of the blockchain. I had always imagined, five or 10 years down the line, that things would be getting built through Octane for rendering. The rendering power for that needed to be more than one person could provide, or even a couple. And so I came up with a few ideas and patents around getting this to run through the millions of graphics cards that were out there.", "Even some of our earliest work for Autodesk was built around peer to peer streaming and sharing, not just the cloud-based stuff. It was through our work through Autodesk that I got a really big break. We and Autodesk triangulated, in 2013, the G2s in the cloud. It was right before than that I went up on stage with Jen-Hsun Huang at the Nvidia conference and showed Octane running on hundreds of graphics cards, knowing that Amazon would have that available within months. We launched the cloud service with that in mind. Amazon was part of making cloud rendering as we have it now in Octane, leveraging the rendering for making some crazier things like lightfields possible. If you look at our current partnerships with Facebook, what we\u2019re doing with video is still all basically Octane-rendered. With Unity we\u2019re integrated primarily to drive our AR and lightfield and volumetric rendering business.", "All those things are pushing what you need for Amazon to deliver through the roof. We have render jobs that are lightfield-based that cost $150,000. They could be cheaper, and they could be done on what\u2019s on the public cloud. We\u2019ve seen, over the last four years, the price of that not really change a lot. Our user base is in the millions now with Unity. I went back to the idea of\u2014we\u2019re going to keep all the GPUs we already have in our service, but we need a lot more. It needs to be cheaper. The best way to do that goes back to my plan to have millions of graphics cards contributing to that.", "Above: Jules Urbach, CEO of Otoy.", "VB: ", "When I talked to [Epic Games CEO] Tim Sweeney", ", he was talking about blockchain as well. He mentioned that, eventually, it\u2019s something we want to render at 60 frames per second. Right now it\u2019s updated about once every 10 minutes. That seems like an awfully big distance to go. How far away from that goal are we, technically? Is there something that helps close that gap to the point where this kind of rendering is useful?", "Urbach:", " Tim is right about the 60 frames per second. Ultimately you want to be able to deliver those actions instantaneously. There\u2019s work being done with Ethereum which is designed to basically create shards. They\u2019re basically shifting Ethereum to having multiple side chains that can validate work much faster. That\u2019s an important consideration for the future.", "But what\u2019s interesting for us is that I don\u2019t need any of that for the stuff we\u2019re doing. The first reason why is that if you look at this work as an extension \u2014 there\u2019s a lot of work that Amazon and Google computers and GPUs are doing, not just for rendering, but for other things. If you can come up with a way to deliver more and cheaper compute power for the services you do through the central\u2014the most expensive things we do at Amazon are not real time streams. They can be, but that\u2019s a small percentage of our business. You remember what we demonstrated in 2013, and we use it for Oculus and Facebook and others, but the majority of the money and the majority of our capacity issues are all about high latency jobs.", "In other words, people want a light field render within a few days. It would take them months to render it locally, if it\u2019s even possible. You just need the work to get done. In the case of light-mapping images, which is used in making games with Unity and Unreal, that\u2019s also offline. Typically a lightmap in a game takes about a day to generate before you publish it. Moving that to the cloud, again\u2014nobody needs this in an instant. The way we built this system is to replace the one-day turnaround we have with something augmented. If you want next-day service and you\u2019re doing 6K of rendering work, that\u2019s where we need to talk further. That\u2019s the big issue that I\u2019m trying to unblock here.", "Having transactions happen where we unlock 60 hours of rendering from one transaction, that\u2019s fine. That\u2019s a great way of leveraging the blockchain. That\u2019s exactly what we need. What\u2019s also interesting is that ultimately, a lot of blockchain issues \u2014 transactions happening at 60 cycles per second, that\u2019s not what we\u2019re trying to do. I\u2019m looking at this as I\u2019m building blocks of reality. We\u2019re literally rendering a simulation of light. We\u2019re at the point where we\u2019re able to measure the benchmark for that so well \u2014 today, render farms, whether they\u2019re rendering or not, they measure their efficiency and the value of what they\u2019re delivering in Octane bench per dollars.", "This token is an even smaller measurement of work, Octane bench work. What we deliver right now on the cloud service is in $5 increments. The cost is designed to go down. The cost is driven by the fact that the demand for rendering is so high that we have to fulfill a lot of the work through Amazon at the cost that Amazon provides.", "Above: Color Noise by Linus Zoll", "VB: To summarize a bit, then, the cost for cloud rendering has dramatically improved over the years, but it\u2019s hit a wall of some kind? The cost hasn\u2019t come down as fast as you would like more recently? Is this the next step to shake that loose again?", "Urbach:", " Right. It\u2019s on two fronts. I was part of the launch of Amazon\u2019s GPU services in 2013, the ones we use today to do rendering. The price they launched at in 2013 is basically identical to the price today, even though they\u2019ve upped the GPUs to the G3. The GPU work is no different from it was in 2013. That\u2019s not great. We haven\u2019t seen any serious competition to that pricing from Google or any others. That might change. It\u2019s expected to.

When we could leverage thousands of GPUs per job\u2014a lot of our rendering jobs are art assets, and a lot of them could be knocked out to a thousand GPUs. The problem is, as we grow our business and we get even 10 customers per day who want to render these kinds of jobs\u2014that will happen with AR, as volumetric rendering becomes so important, and in games. We don\u2019t have those GPUs at Amazon. So the pricing and the capacity are the areas that need to get solved.", "What\u2019s fascinating is that there\u2019s another dimension of real world problems we have. You have so much GPU power being used today to mine cryptocurrency. We\u2019ve found for the first time this year that our customers, they want to be running machines locally to render Octane faster, and the actual hardware isn\u2019t available, because the miners have bought up all these cards and there aren\u2019t any left. We look at how much power it takes to run Bitcoin \u2014 it\u2019s larger than most countries, a huge amount of energy. It\u2019s sucking away energy and GPUs, and it doesn\u2019t do anything. Mining cryptocurrency doesn\u2019t do anything valuable other than just creating a token. That gets more and more expensive every day, the more the blockchain grows.", "One of the goals I had with this system \u2014 it\u2019s just about the right timing for us to have it so you can make more money consistently from pulling that render job at that cost than you would from, essentially, pulling the lottery lever and seeing if you get an Ethereum coin. Right now, mining for Bitcoin, you\u2019re not going to get anywhere."]}

It seems like we\u2019re still waiting for the point where it\u2019s in line with other consumer electronics devices \u2014 $299, $399 \u2014 where someone can try out VR, have a great time, and not get hit by sticker shock when they find out how much their own headset would cost.", "Pallister:", " That\u2019s the goal with what we and Microsoft are trying to do. Can you take a sub-$300 headset and say, \u201cThis will work on the notebook you were going to buy, anyway?\u201d You don\u2019t have to change the notebook you were going to buy and get a high-end gaming machine. You can buy the notebook you wanted anyway and have a great set of experiences. If you want to play high-end 3D games, if you want to play Raw Data, then you\u2019ll buy a different machine.

Phillips", "content": ["As a filmmaker and movie aficionado, watching viewers delight in VR entertainment as enthusiastically as they do hit movies is rewarding, which makes it an honor to create virtual reality experiences for beloved movie franchises. But creating VR that will pass muster with passionate fans of a blockbuster franchise is not an easy undertaking.", "In order to succeed with VR projects for the major studios, creators have to understand some critical rules of the game. Being associated with a revered movie franchise doesn\u2019t guarantee the success of these experiences. Hard work goes into crafting gripping virtual reality experiences that best represent the films that inspired them and attract even more fans to the box office. It also helps to have forward thinking creative executives at the studio that are willing to take risks on this emerging technology.", "Working on virtual reality experiences for hit movies, such as Warner Bros.

Where the goal of VR for major film franchises is to bring lasting fans on board, the opposite could result if viewers aren\u2019t pleased. Storytelling is paramount and often overlooked but it\u2019s the most important thing to consider when conceptualizing these experiences. VR experiences for films \u2014 often released before the films, thus acting as previews \u2014 can conceivably impact the commercial success of the motion picture. An experience must be in careful sync with key plot points and franchise story arcs to win over audiences. At their best, large franchise experiences give users the thrill of having the chance to \u201cbecome\u201d or \u201cmeet\u201d their favorite movie heroes and villains or step into pulse-pounding action.", "Achieving a balance of proper experience length, content, and suspense makes for a successful film studio VR project. VR Experiences that do a really interesting job of horror in the VR space include Guy Shermaldine\u2019s Webby Award-winning ", "Catatonic", " experience influenced many of us in VR filmmaking. It was clear that Guy was very clever about how to present it. The activation is great as they have these nurses standing next to wheelchairs waiting for you to put on the headset. They place the headset on you and there you are in a wheelchair, but now in a mental institute \u2014 a perfect example of how VR experiences can and should be treated as events beyond just putting on a headset.", "Here They Lie", ", a game created by Tangentlmen for PSVR, also works really well. It has this great monochromatic look to it and is almost devoid of jump scares. It\u2019s all ambiance, and to me is one of the most visceral experiences in the space. It speaks to how effective the medium can be at tapping into real human emotions and how we experience fear.", "A second key to success VR creators must understand is the need to live up to the high production values attained by top-tier studio films. A creator\u2019s job is to get people invested in the characters and be absorbed by the world of the film and become lifelong fans. Towards that end, it\u2019s been helpful for us to spend time on set during production for the films. There, we have the unique opportunity to study each filmmaker\u2019s vision, as well as see them direct actors from the film and get to the heart of their performance. As a result, we better understand what the filmmakers are developing with these characters and how to include their cinematography techniques in the creative for each VR experience.", "Filmmakers can also provide insight on such details as setting, consistent lighting, and even the effects of believable sound in VR \u2014 achieved through spatial audio. Sound is a factor not to be overlooked when you\u2019re looking to maximize the impact of an experience. VR is changing so fast, after all, that every project brings new tool sets. We may use new cameras or DIY rigs, for example, and we depend on the assistance of film engineers and cinematographers to shoot successfully.", "Keeping these critical components in mind, my team and I typically come up with a viable story line first. Creating a complete story-driven experience is always our first priority. Then, we turn to the expertise of our creative partners working in film to come to the studio and contribute to the process of shooting, post production and valuable plot insight.", "Lastly, VR creators producing experiences for major films must find new ways to use this evolving medium. Creators must raise the technical bar every time an experience is created, in order to keep a young, tech-savvy audiences engaged and \u2014 quite literally \u2014 thrilled. Not only must the experience be free of technical glitches, but it must also add something to the movie\u2019s narrative in a way that warrants the use of VR technology. Experiences where VR is perceived by audiences as an afterthought to the film, or a tacked-on gimmick to hop on the latest trend, often come under attack.", "Innovation occurs when you assemble a talented crew of artists that are as passionate about the medium and the project as you are. VR has given many young, talented artists in production, post and VFX the opportunity to cultivate their talents without the hierarchy that comes in other disciplines. At SunnyBoy we are constantly experimenting and learning new things. It\u2019s exciting for all of us to be involved in the creation of a new art form and we appreciate how rare it is to have this opportunity to truly discover something before the rules have been written.", "We are also believers in the community and taking in what others in the VR space are setting out to accomplish. VR experimentation is constant, and just like any other art form, creators have to study the work of leading contemporaries. On the flip side, VR is in such a nascent stage right now that nearly anything goes, as long as it\u2019s creative and insightful. It\u2019s not as critical to be ahead of the trends, but to be a part of writing the language for this new medium. The way to do that is to consume content and isolate what works and what is unique for your own practice. Every time I watch new experiences \u2014 while they may not work as whole \u2014 I always find an aspect or quality that I haven\u2019t seen before and store that away for the next project.", "Using these three keys to success, our experiences have represented their movie franchises well and left fans excited by another story being added to their favorite film\u2019s universe.", "Craig S.

The St. Paul,       Minnesota company ", "Urban       Organics", ", which uses aquaponics to raise fish and grow leafy greens,       has already proven the viability of an idea that\u2019s been getting national       attention: year-round indoor farming. In fact, Urban Organics has been       so successful in its pioneering approach that it recently added a second       larger location to meet skyrocketing local demand for its fresh arctic       char and salmon, and organic greens including bok choy, kale, lettuce,       arugula, chard, and spinach.

", "      In a sector of the food industry seeing substantial growth of new       entrants, Urban Organics offers a highly differentiated approach to       vertical farming that addresses market demand for both local and organic       produce and protein. Unlike typical hydroponic farming operations, the       Company can supply produce that is USDA-certified organic by using       solids produced in its fish culturing system as the nutrient source for       the produce. Using natural waste products from one system as the primary       input of another has substantial economic advantages and represents a       far more environmentally sustainable and resource conservative approach       to urban food production.    ", "      In 2014, the company opened its first indoor urban aquaponics farm       inside an old St. Paul brewery complex \u2013 the former Hamm\u2019s Brewery. Its       8,500 sq. ft. became home to a fully-operational farm which housed four       3,500 gallon fish tanks with 4,000 hybrid striped bass plus herbs and       leafy greens-one of the largest and most advanced aquaponics facilities       in the country.

", "      The Hamm\u2019s farm proved the concept, as area restaurateurs and grocers       demanded more ultra-fresh, ultra-local product than the location could       provide. Global water company Pentair, with its main U.S. offices in       Minnesota, was an early supporter of the Hamm\u2019s location \u2013 designing,       engineering and installing the innovative system with its water       filtration and reuse technologies. After the success of the Hamm\u2019s       location, Pentair and Urban Organics joined forces and expanded to a       larger space in another unused urban brewery building-the 87,000 square       foot Schmidt complex, which is in the middle of a revitalization       including artists\u2019 condos and a planned food hall.    ", "      That new Urban Organics Schmidt brewery location opened earlier this       summer. Its 87,000 sq. ft. are home to 14 fish tanks and 50, 5-tier       towering racks of greens, and when it reaches full capacity later this       year, it will provide 275,000 lbs. of fresh fish and 475,000 lbs. of       produce per year to the surrounding region. The USDA-certified-organic       farm has created jobs, brought life back into abandoned buildings,       provided a global model for indoor aquaponics farming, and done it all       without the use of pesticides \u2013 and while using significantly less water       than traditional methods to grow produce.    ", "      \u201cWe started this venture as social entrepreneurs who wanted to figure       out how to bring a reliable source of healthy foods into areas that had       to rely on food transported in from far away,\u201d said Dave Haider,       co-founder of Urban Organics. \u201cIt turned out that our wild idea also       made a lot of sense to a community hungry for organic,       sustainably-raised food, and to other innovators around the world who       had been asking the same questions we were. By collaborating with       Pentair, we\u2019re able to contribute beyond our immediate region-we\u2019re able       to test and perfect the technologies that will make a global impact       advancing the field of large-scale commercial aquaponics.\u201d    ", "      Urban farming is an extremely competitive endeavor, but Urban Organics       continues to add products and customers. Earlier this summer, the farm       rolled out nine different types of packaged greens and salads, now       distributed through regional coops and grocery chains. And by next       summer, arctic char growing in its tanks will be ready for harvest.       Local health care provider HealthPartners, the largest consumer-governed       health care organization in the nation, is now including Urban Organics       greens in patient meals and serving them in its cafeterias.

The planet has stopped turning, plunging one half into freezing darkness and subjecting the other to a blazing heat from perpetual daylight. Indie studio CoseBelle will launch a Kickstarter campaign on September 19 to raise the remaining funds needed to complete development on the game, but a\u00a0", "free demo is available", "\u00a0now to download on the indie platform Itch.io.", "\u201cFor Selling Sunlight, we started with the idea of a world that always faces its own sun, and built the world around that concept,\u201d said CoseBelle founder Giada Zavarise in an email. \u201cHow can people measure the passing of time in a state of constant twilight? What values does a sun-centered religion have? How are people with a dark skin considered? As we answered those questions, civilizations took shape.\u201d", "As Zavarise implies, learning about the lore is a big part of Selling Sunlight. When I played the demo, which was a short experience, I learned snippets of information about different beliefs, suggesting a world with myriad sects and cultures. Some people worshipped the sun. Others rebelled against it. One village had a tradition called the Metamorphosis, which enabled someone to take a new name and thus a completely new identity. The finished game, I imagine, will expand on these ideas.", "\u201cThe fantasy novels I prefer are the ones by authors like Ursula Le Guin and China Mi\u00e9ville: the ones that feel fantastical not because they have magic and monsters, but because they paint different cultures, different ways of living,\u201d said Zavarise.", "All these things coalesce in the protagonist\u2019s journey. You play an unnamed merchant who has committed an unspecified crime against the sun. As a punishment, you\u2019re forced to wear a mask over your face, and your identity and memories have been wiped away. The story seems to focus on how you\u2019ll decide to move forward: Do you seek to reclaim your old identity, forge a new one, or perhaps seek vengeance?", "One thing\u2019s for sure about your character: They\u2019re not a fighter. As a merchant, you interact with the world through bartering, whether that\u2019s for goods or information. When you enter a shop to purchase items, you enter \u201chaggling mode\u201d where you attempt to cajole and convince the other person to lower their price. In conversation, you can select your attitude toward someone to elicit different reactions, and they\u2019ll remember how you\u2019ve behaved toward them.", "\u201cYou\u2019re a merchant. You can\u2019t gift, nor build, anything: All your social interactions revolve around fair trading,\u201d said Zavarise. \u201cBarter with other merchants and you\u2019ll become friends. They\u2019ll tell you about their problems, and to help you\u2019ll often have to look for rare items, thus exploring new cities and meeting new merchants. It\u2019s a positive gameplay loop that rewards you for being kind.\u201d", "Though the dialogue and story are key, Selling Sunlight also looks lovely. It has a light-dappled aesthetic with rich, textured colors and hand-drawn portraits, and it uses a mishmash of art styles. Some of the backgrounds look like they\u2019ve been shaded with crayon, while the characters stand out like paper cutouts in sharp relief.", "\u201cAs for the art style, [Chiara Boscaro] and [Anita Zaramella] took inspiration from the ", "Art Nouveau movement", " and started working with watercolors because, as comic book artists, it\u2019s what they excel at,\u201d said Zavarise. \u201cIt can be an unusual choice for a game, but for us it was only natural.\u201d", "Boscaro and Zaramella are the two other full-time members of CoseBelle. They handle all the artwork, and Zavarise does everything else. Their first collaboration was on a comic book, but once the idea for Selling Sunlight crystalized, they began working on it in earnest in April 2016.", "\u201cThe project is in a pretty good shape right now: most of the core mechanics have been programmed, and now it\u2019s mostly a matter of fleshing out the world by adding more locations, characters and storylines,\u201d said Zavarise.", "They were selected for the Failbetter Games ", "incubation program", ", which aims to provide indie developers with a free workspace and mentorship. ", "Failbetter", "\u00a0has its roots in interactive fiction, and it\u2019s well known for its literary games like Fallen London, Sunless Sea, and its recently Kickstarted project ", "Sunless Skies", ".", "\u201cI get to stay in their office, drink their tea, and cry on someone\u2019s shoulder when something goes wrong,\u201d said Zavarise. \u201cMost important, I can sit in a corner during their meetings and see how a Real Game Studio works. It was an incredibly useful experience and I\u2019d recommend it to everyone!\u201d", "Country required", "*By checking this box, you are confirming you are an adult 18 years or older and you agree to Intel contacting you with marketing-related emails or by telephone.

But what has taken hold in the cryptocurrency market place in recent years stands in stark contrast to these early utopian promises. Instead, a new batch of nefarious investors are hijacking the technology for their own interests.", "The reason blockchain was an effective counter-narrative to the 2008 financial crisis is that the technology works on the presumption that no one can really trust anyone, and the only way to prevent fraud is to make all transactions universally available on a \u201cpublic ledger.\u201d This concept taps into a libertarian model of self-policing that works around the need for government regulators and major financial institutions.", "Since the launch of Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies have expanded at a feverish pace. To date, there are over 3,000 variations of blockchain technologies (into which billions of dollars have been invested).", "The latest trend in the cryptocurrency market are the initial coin offerings (ICOs), also commonly referred to as \u201ctoken sales.\u201d ICOs raise funds through a crowdfunding process similar to stock purchasing, where instead of being issued a traditional security, investors purchase a new crypto-coin which is frequently tied, directly or indirectly, to a potential money-making venture. While a small subgroup of tokens, called \u201cutility tokens,\u201d do not possess the economic features of a security, and should not be treated as such by regulators, many other tokens sold in ICOs resemble traditional stock.", "These stock-like tokens must be held accountable by a regulatory authority.", "I\u2019m bullish on the long-term view of ICOs. They can eliminate the need for companies to engage outside agents to handle financial transactions and money transfers. They also allow companies to avoid exchange rates and transaction fees, as all returns can be paid out through crypto-wallets. Cryptocurrency tokens are transmitted quickly between consumers and businesses. And, by lowering or eliminating extraneous overhead costs, businesses can offer lower initial share costs and open the option of investing to more individuals and at lower initial buy-ins. Most importantly, ICOs could completely revolutionize the existing way consumers and investors perceive basic concepts of company stock, ownership, and valuation.", "But like the intrepid housing market presaging the 2008 financial crisis, below the surface of flashy dollar signs is a rather jaundiced reality.", "A ", "recent report", " from Chainalysis, a New York-based firm that analyzes transactions and provides anti-money laundering software, revealed that not only are one out of every 10 ICOs fraudulent, but some 30,000 investors have fallen prey to ICO cybercrime, with losses totaling over $225 million.", "Many ICOs are similar to Ponzi schemes. They capitalize on hype and market frenzy, pulling in as many investors as possible to increase the value of the underlying cryptocurrency. Then, just as the value rockets upwards, the initial investors cash out or trade the tokens for other cryptocurrencies, all before the floor collapses beneath them. While the lucky few profit, the last ones out are left holding worthless digital code.", "Worse still, there is a fundamental information asymmetry in the crypto-sphere. The major players \u2013 those who are plugged into various coin networks and the blockchain \u2013 are able to accurately speculate, in nanoseconds, on the ups and downs of an ICO, which leads to drastic price fluctuations, and allows some to function as de facto gatekeepers. This type of pumping and dumping, not unlike hyper day trading, may be a form of insider trading and illegal. But absent regulation enforcement, they can continue this practice unabated.", "There is a cruel irony here: The short-sighted, profit-driven, ", "Gordon Gekko", "-types of the world, now free of the reins of traditional intermediaries and at least temporarily out of reach of government regulators, can enrich themselves on the backs of the very people who turned to ICOs because of their distrust of Wall Street. Instead of addressing these pervasive issues, the gatekeepers will instead proselytize the disruptive potential of ICOs, all the while profiting from such lip service.", "The lesson from 2008 is not that regulatory authorities are bad, it\u2019s that they need to be enforced uniformly. Absent regulators, bad actors will penetrate markets and, out of their own self interest, ruin them for everyone else.", "There are some signs of hope. The SEC ", "recently issued", " clarifications. Still, this largely falls short of what is necessary to curtail bad actors. What a regulator like the SEC needs to do is bring stability and integrity to ICOs. This starts by eliminating the scams upfront and ensuring transparency in all transactions. Disclosure laws must be followed; adherence to their guidelines will help democratize investing. The result is that a broader, bespoke class will be able to participate in revenue sharing streams traditionally reserved for high-wealth individuals and institutional investors.", "The regulations to achieve these goals are already in place. Perhaps, due to technical and design difficulties, they lack active enforcement at the moment. But the path forward for ICOs is clear. We need a regulator like the SEC to stabilize and mature the cryptocurrency market. This will ensure that investors are no longer being duped by self-aggrandizing gatekeepers and that the benefits of cryptocurrencies can finally be unleashed to the masses.", "Justin Bailey is CEO and founder of ", "Fig", "."]}

Where a company used to raise $1 million, it might now raise $20 million, and where an investor might have had to wait five years to get her money back from a purchase of illiquid startup equity, she can now sell her crypto asset an hour after buying it.", "Like derivatives, it is important to ask what crypto assets do in the context of current institutions, not in some social vacuum. Derivatives like mortgage-backed securities are a great idea. In the context of institutions full of ideological regulators, that great idea caused the Great Recession.", "And this is where we get back to the nonprofit-crypto asset connection.

Illiquidity greatly decreases value and increases risk.", "Third, constructing that type of financial product is expensive \u2014 usually (between the lawyers drafting and the lawyers reviewing it) in the six figures. This effectively divorces financial innovation from the innovators: young, startup-like nonprofits.", "Crypto assets solve all three of these problems.", "A large, growing body of investors understand crypto assets. Anyone of them can take a large risk on a worthwhile project and sell her position an hour later.

I also count crossovers as one of my guilty pleasures (I probably watched ", "The Jetsons Meet the Flintstones", " a few too many times as a kid).", "Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite, which comes out on September 18 for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, is the new entry in the series. I got to play the PlayStation 4 version (on my PlayStation 4 Pro) for my review.

The character models look a bit janky and lifeless, and ", "Capcom", " is focusing on heroes and villains from Disney\u2019s Marvel Cinematic Universe. This means no Wolverine, Deadpool, and a bunch of other iconic heroes.", "I shared those concerns.

Infinite slows things down just a bit. You have two characters on your team instead of three for the first time since the original Marvel vs. Capcom. You also can\u2019t call in allies to deliver assist attacks.", "But the fighting is still fast. If you want to win, you need to string together large combos that can go all over the place \u2014 the air, the ground \u2014 and even extend as you swap in a new character. Pulling off a huge combo still feels great.", "The action is also a bit more friendly to newcomers. Every character can pull off a basic combo by continually pushing the light punch button. It\u2019s not as easy as it sounds, since you have to learn to mix in new moves or cancel the combo into super attacks if you want to optimize your damage. But it does mean that it\u2019s easier for even a novice player to punish you if you miss an attack or aren\u2019t blocking properly.", "The mechanics are mostly similar to past Marvel vs. Capcom games, but the Infinity Stones stand out as the most significant addition. These are the same gems that you\u2019ve been watching Thor and Iron Man fret over on the big screen for the past decade. You can choose from six of them, and each one represents a different kind of power.", "Before a fight, you pick your team\u2019s Infinity Stone, and you can activate its ability with the press of a button. The Power Stone, for example, knocks enemies back. The Time Stone will teleport you forward a short distance. Using these abilities also helps charge up a new meter. When it\u2019s at least half full, you can activate an Infinity Surge. You\u2019ll then have some special benefits until that meter depletes. The Space Stone will trap the enemy player in a transparent cube, while the Mind Stone will help you quickly refill your Super meter.", "Above: Stuck in the Space Stone place.", "The campaign", "The addition of a single-player campaign is my favorite thing in Infinite. Before now, the games never bothered to justify why these two universes were suddenly together. After all, the whole series started because Capcom could easily bring in sprites from a bunch of different games (including Street Fighter Alpha and its 2D X-Men fighter).", "But Infinite\u2019s story mode actually gives us some plot. It\u2019s ridiculous. It\u2019s corny. It doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense. But it\u2019s fun. It\u2019s nice to see these characters interact with each other in ways outside of fighting. I got a few geeky chills seeing Mega Man X and Captain America standing side-by-side. Dead Rising\u2019s Frank West and Spider-Man get to share a humorous moment. Arthur from Ghosts & Goblins and Thor have more chemistry than they have any right to.", "The story revolves around Sigma (the bad guy from Mega Man X) and Ultron (one of The Avenger\u2019s chief villains) teaming up and combining the Marvel and Capcom universes. And they literally combine them. You\u2019re not just fighting in Asgard, you\u2019re fighting in an Asgard that\u2019s been combined with the opening highway level from Mega Man X. These crossover stages are just as novel as seeing Hulk smash Ryu.", "The campaign is also a great way to become familiar with the game\u2019s mechanics and most of its roster.

But it\u2019s not especially pretty. It doesn\u2019t do anything to stand out visually, but it looks fine. The character models that look stiff and dead in the eyes when you\u2019re staring at screenshots or promotional stills look much better in action, especially since the fighting always ran at a smooth 60 fps for me. But it is a safe, even boring art direction for a game with such a colorful and wacky concept.", "The presentation problems go beyond the art, though. The menus are boring.

That seems pretty big until you remember that Marvel vs. Capcom 3 started with 36, and its re-release (Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom) had a whopping 48.

You won\u2019t find Amaterasu from Okami or Viewtiful Joe here. And I\u2019d like to raise a loud objection over the lack of any Ace Attorney characters.", "To be fair, the brand new fighters in Infinite are pretty cool. It\u2019s nice to see Captain Marvel and Mega Man X finally make it in one of these games. But Infinite is only launching with five characters that are new to the series. Another six are coming as downloadable content, which stings when the roster size is already so comparably small to past entries in the series. And you\u2019ll have to spend real money to get them. Infinite doesn\u2019t have any in-game currency.", "Above: The game can still look cool.", "I know a lot of people are worried about Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite. Well, a lot of your fears are justified. The roster is lacking. The game doesn\u2019t look great (it certainly can\u2019t compete with Injustice 2 in the presentation department).", "But Infinite is still a lot of fun. It\u2019ll take fighting game experts with more proficiency than me to figure out if it has any life in the tournament scene, but I expect its fast-paced action and new Infinity Stone mechanic will attract some pros. And if you aren\u2019t planning on winning any major tournaments soon and just want to see Rocket Racoon and Dante from Devil May Cry share jokes and guns, then you\u2019ll find plenty of entertainment in the campaign.", "It\u2019s not as big and beautiful as I want it to be, but Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite still has plenty to offer.", "Score: 75/100", "Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite comes out for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on September 19.

They made Onyx to answer the simple but important questions they needed to do to their jobs.", "In most cases, Robbins said, line-level employees already know the questions they need help answering on a regular basis.\u00a0In their case, it was things like, \u201cIs there a hospital in the bay?\u201d \u201cIs this hospital open?\u201d \u201cCan we send a patient there?\u201d", "\u201cThis doesn\u2019t require general-purpose AI. It\u2019s really a little more specific, where you\u2019re able to say, \u2018We just want to provide helpful answers in real time to people that are doing really important work\u2019,\u201d he said.", "To answer questions, Orion Labs\u2019 bots plug into both real-time databases and spreadsheets maintained by customers.", "Robbins declined to state the number of clients Orion Labs works with today, but customers range from local governments and small businesses to multinational corporations.", "To fuel its bots\u2019 translation and speech understanding, Orion Labs uses a mashup of AI services from companies like Microsoft, Google, and IBM Watson.", "The $18.25 million funding round was led by Allen & Company LLC, with participation from Argentum, The Thermo Companies, Fuel Capital, and a collection of private individuals.", "Since its launch in 2013, Orion Labs has raised about $30 million. The company has 50 employees and is based in San Francisco."]}

Plans including creating new simulations for science students, as well as a plan to \u201cinitiate special projects\u201d in other regions, including South America, the Middle East, and Africa.", "\u201cBy uniting elements from the psychology of learning, virtual simulations, and gaming, Labster is helping students learn more effectively and use resources that might be otherwise impossible to access,\u201d explained Labster founder and CEO Mads Tvillinggaard. \u201cThis funding from Balderton Capital and Northzone will give us the opportunity to engage even more students globally, helping young people achieve their qualifications as well as opening up their minds to the applications of science.\u201d", "It\u2019s easy to see how Labster would appeal to both students and educational institutions, as the virtual environment circumvents the expenses and hazards of real-world experiments. There is no limit to the number of times a student can repeat an experiment through Labster, and, if nothing else, it serves as a good way to practice before attempting an experiment in a real lab."]}

They\u2019re where you meet new customers and potential partners, ", "foster existing relationships", ", and raise brand awareness. However, events can be a huge drain on your financial and company resources, and it\u2019s not always easy to decide which events you should focus your efforts on. So here are some guidelines to help startups with limited budgets determine when to attend, skip, or sponsor an event.", "Prior to deciding if your startup should participate in an event, it\u2019s important to ", "create a list of goals", ". You can use these goals to reduce the number of events you consider and ensure a targeted approach to achieve a higher ROI.", "At my company, our goal is seeing high engagement with our specific decision makers \u2014 not just general \u201cconsumer awareness.\u201d Because of that, we stay focused and ", "attend events that have relevant attendees and topics", " that can help a brand get recognition in their niche industry. Not only will potential clients have better knowledge of the respective industry, but they\u2019ll also attain a deeper understanding of who the brand really is.", "The higher number of brands in attendance, the harder it is to break through the noise. Events like SXSW and Cannes, for example, are extremely popular. They\u2019re generally interesting and have a good lineup of talks, presentations, and side events, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re right for the brand you\u2019re building. The level of investment required to participate and do something meaningful at mainstream events like these is incredibly high, and much of the audience you\u2019re paying to reach isn\u2019t even necessarily your target audience.", "Some brands ", "spend more than half of their total budget", " on branding activations, which means you\u2019ll be going up against other brands (many of whom aren\u2019t even actual competitors in your space) that are happy to put excessive resources towards bigger events. Trying to compete with the noise and saturation from these bigger brands ultimately diminishes the return on every dollar you spend at these events.", "Additionally, when you define your goals, you can optimize your work spent on events. Instead of going to hundreds of events in a year, you can go to 10 great and impactful ones that map back to your goals. The fewer events a brand attends, the more budget is available to be used toward more unique sponsorship opportunities that stand out.", "You also need to consider what your staffing situation would look like at an event. At startups, people are busy with their own job responsibilities outside of working events. You likely don\u2019t have a lot of people available for traveling to several events throughout the year, whereas bigger companies have a whole team of at least 15 dedicated to it. Sending staff to events also means taking them away from the office, which may not be so easy when you\u2019re in the early days of building a company.", "After you\u2019ve narrowed down the list of potential conferences, take a closer look and evaluate the level of impact each one can have. This includes taking a look at the approach of the event and its location and then mapping it back to your business goals and growth opportunity.", "For starters, take a closer look at the conference programming. It\u2019s worth attending if the conference has a unique approach that\u2019s different from other events you\u2019ve attended in the past. That may mean more or fewer panels, fireside chats, or breakout sessions. Clich\u00e9s in panel topics (and in participants) are rampant in most verticals. Unique and thoughtful panel topics are interesting in their own right, but they are also indicative of the overall quality of a show.", "Next, consider who\u2019s attending. You want to go to events that have relevant customers and brands. Many events suffer from \u201ctoo many sponsors\u201d syndrome. Events make money off sponsorships, and some of them are so focused on doing so that they forget they need to ensure good brands and attendees come. Although the event may initially look good, you can often end up with very few customers or potential customers to meet. In our industry, ", "Grow.co", " puts a focused effort on attracting brands and limiting the sponsors and vendors. They keep the content top-notch and focus on industry experts and media buyers driving the content instead of sponsors selling their products. Don\u2019t forget to ask partners, coworkers, or trusted friends that have attended in previous years what their expectations and thoughts were.", "Also, take a look at the location of the event. It should be where current and potential clients are and in regions that align with your overall business growth and opportunity. For example, if your startup doesn\u2019t operate and have any employees or immediate plans to launch in Europe, attending a conference in Amsterdam doesn\u2019t make much sense. However, if you are growing in APAC, review the core events happening in that region (this is an area where events are key to brand awareness and success), and ensure you divert budget for them.", "Once you decide to participate in a conference, you need to decide whether to attend or to sponsor.", "Attending an event is a must if you\u2019re looking to network, build your brand, or at the very least, learn something. For example, if the CEO is attending, make sure they can also meet with clients that are attending or potential clients the company is interested in. It\u2019s even better if there are speaking opportunities involved. Positioning your brand as a thought leader in the space should be one of your goals, and speaking in front of ", "different audiences helps you build that credibility", ".", "Learning is also one of the main reasons", " to attend a conference. You\u2019ll get the opportunity to hear from other industry experts about what is currently trending, possibly find inspiration for future speaking ideas, or simply determine if the event is worth attending in the future.", "On the other hand, if an event hits everything on your checklist \u2014 it has the right audience, it\u2019s the right price, and it offers the opportunity to have a bigger impact \u2014 sponsoring might be the best option for your startup. If you are seriously considering sponsoring, take into consideration what the sponsorship package offers and how you\u2019re going to execute.", "Not all sponsorship opportunities come with a speaking opportunity, but some do, which may be of particular interest. Speaking slots can fill up, so if the attendees at a respective conference are the exact people you want to get in front of and there\u2019s an opportunity to make a larger impact more strategically, then move forward and sponsor the event.", "A good alternative to sponsoring an event is to host a VIP dinner to ensure your brand meets with the exact people you\u2019re looking to get in front of. As you start planning, be sure to confirm how many of your staff members are needed to man the event and how many are actually free.", "Last but not least, don\u2019t forget to negotiate with the event organizers on possible discounts. The package price is often much higher than you actually have to pay. Just like you probably wouldn\u2019t pay the sticker price for a car, you shouldn\u2019t do so for an event sponsorship either.\u00a0 First, focus on getting the best price you can. Then turn to adding in some \u201cfreebies.\u201d For example, a sponsorship package may only include a limited number of passes, but you may need more, and it\u2019s worth asking. Additionally, you may be able to get a higher number of brand awareness opportunities, like adding your logo to water bottle labels or signs at a breakfast.", "And not all speaking slots are created equal \u2014 the last slot in the afternoon of an all-day conference (when many have already left), or one just before lunch (as lines at the buffet begin to form) are close to useless. So make sure the time you speak is one of the points you negotiate. For example, try to get late morning or early afternoon slots on the second day of a show.", "Once you set goals, you might find that popular events don\u2019t meet your criteria as you evaluate them. It\u2019s entirely okay to skip, regardless of how big and popular an event may be. However, if you do decide to attend or sponsor an event, make sure it\u2019s in front of the right audience and has the potential to deliver a high ROI.", "Katie Jansen", " is CMO of AppLovin."]}

That legitimately came from the emotion and\u00a0neuroscience perspective.\u201d", "Project Axon is a large-scale group game that involved 100 participants. The players were split into two groups and told that they were alien civilizations at war with one another. One player, dubbed the Ancient One, sat away from the others with a VR headset and made\u00a0decisions and passed judgment based only on the information the rest gave them via a mobile app.", "The Ancient One would only see the top four headlines on a kind of social media feed in their headset, which the rest of the players controlled indirectly by liking stories on their app. Most of the players were citizens, but a few got the role of \u201cmedia.\u201d These could see which headlines were accurate and which were false, and they could choose which ones to promote.", "Culyba says that couching it in a science-fiction context added more distance from the interaction so that the players could actually think about what they were doing and the way biases affect behavior. The social media-like interface connected their actions in the game back to how they might actually use real social media in their daily lives.", "\u201cOne of the big challenges with making something for impact\u2014whenever you\u2019re trying to change someone\u2019s mind or change their behavior, your goal isn\u2019t just that at the moment they read it, they think, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s a really good point,'\u201d said Culyba. \u201cYour goal is, a week later they\u2019re different.\u201d", "In addition to VR and the mobile app, Project Axon also took place in a physical space. Culyba said that itself led to a lot of design decisions to get players to behave in a certain way.", "\u201cOne of their goals was to get people to have conversations. They arranged the chairs in semicircles, so when people sat down they were naturally facing each other in a way that said, you are a small group,\u201d said Culyba. He added, \u201cThey have two different roles in the experience \u2014 citizens and media. They gave the media hats. Just the act of putting on a costume gets people to behave differently.\u201d", "Project Axon isn\u2019t available to download since the team built it to present only\u00a0at the festival. But it\u2019s a part of the larger conversation around \u201cfake news\u201d and particularly the way media can affect people\u2019s perspectives.

It didn\u2019t quite work like that, though.", "While some people did embrace the mashup of genres to create a small but dedicated fanbase, many reacted with confusion and even resentment. Despite our efforts to promote Drifting Lands first and foremost as an ARPG in all of our public-facing communications, the majority of people held it to the expectations of a classic shoot-\u2019em-up.\u00a0Stages without boss battles, the need to constantly upgrade weaponry, grinding for high-end gear, and RNG-based loot \u2014 these were some of the most widely criticized elements. What\u2019s interesting to note is how such facets of gameplay are also staples of our ARPG influences. So, players either missed our game description, or read it and still expected a classic shoot-\u2019em-up over an ARPG.", "It raises an interesting question: why is it that one genre mashup is accepted at face value and one is not? Are shmups simply too rooted in tradition? Did we push too far, or not far enough? Trying to please everyone is a quick route to making a bland game, and, in our case, a lot of feedback from early players was diametrically opposed due to the differences in genres. As a designer, the alchemy needed to balance your vision with players\u2019 expectations in such a scenario is both delicate and mysterious.", "Drifting Lands is not a perfect game, and certainly there were changes we would loved to have made with the benefit of a larger budget and more time. That said, I\u2019m quite proud of what we achieved as a six-person team. On the whole, the game works as intended and we have players spending more than 50 hours in the game.", "Economically though, Drifting Lands was a far more dangerous project than I had imagined. Was it avoidable? Almost certainly. With more research, perhaps we would have learned that some traditions aren\u2019t to be meddled with, or how to better introduce players to a new spin on an old idea. The difficulty is in getting to the heart of that information.", "For example, prototyping is an invaluable tool for gauging an idea\u2019s feasibility early in development. That said, there is a huge difference between prototyping something like a linear FPS, versus a system-heavy ARPG like Drifting Lands.

Being able to touch things and smell things \u2014 between the haptics and the other 4D effects we add to our experiences, that\u2019s what creates that true immersion, as well as the social aspect.

How do you show an audience something they haven\u2019t seen before? It\u2019s no different with what we\u2019re doing at The Void.

People still go to amusement parks because you can\u2019t replicate any of that at home. Some of the things that we\u2019re doing, even though we don\u2019t have a very big footprint, are still more than you can do at home, especially that social experience that we try to create.", "But there are things we\u2019re doing to create an in-home experience that may prepare you for going to a Void center, or allow you to network in. We\u2019re working on technology where we can have people in different physical locations still share the same virtual worlds. That will give us some flexibility, not just at our Void centers, but for people who can engage from home.", "GamesBeat: A lot of those connections seem to be in the works.

The company raised $10.3 million in 2015 from Comcast Ventures, Tencent, Dolby Family Ventures, Raine Ventures, Lux Capital, Western Technology Investments, Maven Ventures, Promus Ventures, Streamlined Ventures, and Rothenberg Ventures.", "Romo said in an interview with GamesBeat in April that AltspaceVR was hoping to monetize events that companies paid for, not unlike\u00a0the way Linden Lab monetized corporations in its Second Life virtual world. But AltspaceVR\u2019s traffic was relatively small, at about 35,000 users a month. That\u2019s a sign of how small the overall base for VR is and it probably tells you why the company ran out of funds, as that number isn\u2019t enough to get investors excited.", "It\u2019s not clear exactly what this means for other VR startups, but everybody knows that growth is slower than expected.

AltSpace and Linden Lab\u2019s\u00a0Sansar, for example, have spent a lot of time building out a really robust infrastructure platform and are largely relying on other developers to create fun experiences built atop their platform. Rec Room and Star Trek, on the other hand, have focused more on providing a compelling, engaging experience off the bat for users, which in turn has the potential to build a strong social community. Given the user numbers and slower adoption curve, as an investor I prefer the latter strategy.\u201d", "Above: AltspaceVR comedy night.", "He added, \u201cIn terms of what it means for venture-backed VR companies, I think it\u2019s probably a reality check in a somewhat frothy market. I think Eric and his team are fantastic and trust they\u2019ll find their way.\u201d", "And Tipatat Chennavasin, cofounder of the Venture Reality Fund, said in an email, \u201cWhen a shutdown happens, it\u2019s hard to understand without knowing all the details. AltspaceVR, led by Eric Romo, was a true pioneer and did some ground-breaking work in VR and social. It\u2019s a shame they weren\u2019t able to get further funds to continue to innovate \u2014 the news also comes right after Within announcing a $40 million round, indicating evolving investor dynamics in the sector.\u201d", "Chennavasin added: \u201cFor later venture rounds, the bar is raised higher and tangible metrics really come into play. A lot of times the main challenge for early innovators is to manage the company\u2019s growth in a nascent but potentially explosive market where there are no established investment patterns and the venture investors are still discovering the subtleties of the sector. Altspace has opened many doors of creativity and teased us all with compelling possibilities in social VR. I\u2019m afraid their timing wasn\u2019t precisely aligned with investor sentiments, especially in later rounds where certain growth parameters are expected, which is hard to do in early stages of the VR market with a small installed base.\u00a0One last thing I will add is that the team were not just pioneers but also great supporters of the larger VR development community and will be missed. They have definitely learned a lot on their journey and I look forward to seeing what they do next.\u201d", "Andrew Wilson, CEO of Electronic Arts, also said on Thursday", " that it may be a couple of years\u2019 wait for the mass VR market.", "Jason Rubin, head of studios at Oculus VR, said in an interview last week that he isn\u2019t surprised big companies like EA and Activision Blizzard haven\u2019t jumped into VR yet. He sees smaller companies moving into VR that they will stake out the opportunities first. Once that happens, the big companies, like EA, will likely acquire those that have the lead.", "Regarding Wilson\u2019s comments, Mahajan said, \u201cI don\u2019t disagree with him. The consumer VR market is going to take a while to develop still. I think new Daydream phones and Apple\u2019s (rumored) addition of an OLED screen to the iPhone 8 will help drive adoption of mass market consumer VR. But we\u2019re at least one phone refresh cycle away (18 to 24 months) from everyone having VR available to them.\u201d", "Stephanie Llamas, analyst at SuperData Research, said, \u201cI think the closure was an example of how good companies suffer from the prematurely inflated expectations for the industry as a whole that many companies had early on. Primarily, investors are now spooked because there was an overvaluation of the market. Now that growth isn\u2019t going as fast as they\u2019d expected, they reevaluated their risk and are now undervaluing certain opportunities. AltspaceVR was truly a pioneer in the social VR space. It should not have been discounted, and I honestly think this is a tragedy for the industry.\u201d", "Bjorn Laurin, vice president of product at Linden Lab, said he too was sorry to see the sad outcome for AltspaceVR.

I was building great games for workforce development, training, and learning.", "We started off by going to large companies in Pittsburgh, like Alcoa and Westinghouse and US Steel.

Bunchball in particular, I went out to see their CEO. I think internally we did not consider ourselves part of that, because when we started, earlier on, out of Carnegie Mellon, we were really focused on solving real problems with games that were using the concept of simulation to train. How could you do a better, faster, cheaper flight simulation, but for all these other occupations? Not so much adding incentives and rewards around a structure that was already there, like sales.", "We also acknowledge that as part of a larger wave in the market, though, for people to understand \u2014 people would say, \u201cOh, you\u2019re a gamification company?\u201d And we\u2019d say, \u201cOkay, sure.\u201d The reason we changed the name of the company \u2014 there were a couple of reasons, but the reason we finally changed it to Simcoach Games was because we were using game design as a differentiator from passive learning to active learning.

They\u2019re not as deep. They\u2019re not around compliance training, so it\u2019s not truly game-based simulation.

And when they are filled there\u2019s too much turnover. How can we balance that out? There are always people out of work who don\u2019t know what they want to do. Maybe one subset of that goes on to a four-year college, but really shouldn\u2019t. Those are the kinds of things we\u2019re looking at.

Getting people aware about what their path might be from training to a career, and some of the skills. Do you have an aptitude or a proclivity toward those skills? A big one, huge, is construction. There are 20-plus different trades, and in this country primarily \u2014 if your dad wasn\u2019t a carpenter you don\u2019t think about being a carpenter, let alone other trades.

Those are the ones that we\u2019re generally focused on, because we have those needs here, and then we\u2019re building out across the country. Also retail, retail grocery, and technology. How do you find a high-school dropout or someone from a low-income, disadvantaged environment that might have the wiring to do a technical job, but has never been encouraged in that way and doesn\u2019t really know? Can you use games to get their attention and have them solve puzzles, like in an entertainment game? Then you feel out at the end that they have that proclivity and ramp them into a training program. Those are the kinds of jobs we\u2019re looking at right now, but I know we can use games in different areas beyond that.", "GamesBeat: So the game is meant to give you an idea of what the job is like, visually?", "Trybus:", " There are maybe three, four, five categories of games that we\u2019re building today. One might be career awareness in general. One might be life skills, soft skills. We hear this from employers \u2014 a lot of folks don\u2019t know it\u2019s important to show up on time, to plan time management. How to interact with other people. Basic stuff to be successful at a job that has nothing to do with the skills of a job. Also, the aptitude assessment, the types of games I mentioned for things like tech aptitude, as well as maybe safety skills, particular skills for a particular occupation.", "The idea is, can you play all this so that when you\u2019re recruited, or you want to go into a training program, so you have an idea of what you\u2019re going into? You play a crane game to be attracted to being an operating engineer. It doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re certified to operate a crane, but it means you know what it\u2019s like to operate a crane. You understand the physics, the controls, the safety and variables that play into it, how much money you can make, and all in a fun way.", "GamesBeat: Can you make the game really fun and let you knock a bunch of buildings down?", "Trybus:", " Sure you can. That\u2019s a big part of what we learned from the day we started the company. We want to give them a taste, but we want to make the game in and of itself fun and motivate them to find out more. Or maybe you\u2019re motivated to not find out more. You talk about\u2014I don\u2019t want to work at heights on a tower crane. I don\u2019t want to work in a lot of snow here.

The games are free. That\u2019s the model. Schools, from middle schools to high schools to tech schools, are interested in using these to reinforce their curriculum and their messaging. The schools, at least in Pennsylvania, have to create opportunities for career awareness and career exploration. That\u2019s built into our law. How they do that is a bit broader, but these games are starting to fit in \u2013 both the soft skills games I mentioned and the career-specific ones.", "GamesBeat: How do you make money? Is it on a project basis with companies?", "Trybus:", " Traditionally we\u2019ve taken on games with development partners that know the problem we\u2019re solving, know the content. They\u2019ve paid for the games to be developed. Our core focus, our core model, is the licensing of a data dashboard to a training organization or industry association or an employer.", "I mentioned that crane game. If you\u2019re looking to recruit operating engineers, you might pick out five of the games we have that are applicatble to your trade. Essentially, that organization would pay for data per game, per zip code, to see who in that zip code has played these games, has done well, and expressed more interest. That\u2019s the connection. The games have, and will have, a direct \u2014 they\u2019ll be localized. If you\u2019re interested, it\u2019ll you send you to a local organization that provides training or an onramp to find out about getting into those careers. That\u2019ll be different here than it is in, say, northern California. We call it regional target messaging. The clients pay on a software service model.", "GamesBeat: It\u2019s like using mobile game analytics and user acquisition for job recruits.", "Trybus:", " Right. All of our games are free. The idea is, if you play these games, you sign up and create a digital profile in our \u2014 the thing is called the Simcoach Skill Arcade. It\u2019s the games, the digital profile, and the data dashboard. You acknowledge that if you play these games, you\u2019re going to accrue badges, achievements, and that data can be shared with potential employers.

Exposing them to careers that are available without getting too into the weeds on when they have to start training. But that\u2019s when they say it\u2019s important to start this exposure, in middle school, so they can think through it over the next couple of years.", "GamesBeat: How were you inspired to create the company in the beginning?", "Trybus:", " Personally, I was working on the question of whether we could build games for training. I was doing that at the ETC. I thought, \u201cWell, instead of going back out west to create games, I\u2019ll go to industry and start to learn about their needs.\u201d I think it just started itself really fast, because back then \u2014 2004, when I started to talk to companies \u2013 I was surprised by how much they thought this made sense, even when I was talking about special graphics cards and high-powered computers to run the games. We weren\u2019t running 3D games in browsers in 2005.", "Above: Simcoach\u2019s Selector Safety shows you how to operate safely in construction areas.", "GamesBeat: Is that what some companies wanted? The equivalent of Uncharted 4?", "Trybus:", " Yeah, but we work through that. The budgets were \u2014 we were building games for a couple hundred thousand dollars, or a couple million. Now that cost is much lower, but of course we\u2019re making a much shorter game that focuses on specific critical skills. We have a pretty tried and true process that\u2019s evolved, a method for creating these, how we do them and how we integrate the content experts. But yeah, I think up front \u2014 we had to focus on, what\u2019s the learning objective? How does this feature or that feature benefit the learning, as opposed to just being cool?", "GamesBeat: Your company seems to fit here more than it would in, say, Hollywood.", "Trybus:", " For sure. I really think it\u2019s a great Pittsburgh story, because of Pittsburgh\u2019s history. It feels like Pittsburgh to be applying the techniques and technologies of game design and development to solve industry problems. Especially for a lot of the industries here. We\u2019re excited about where it\u2019s evolved to and where we\u2019re going.", "GamesBeat: What does your client list look like? Is it spread around the country, or is it concentrated here?", "Trybus:", " A lot of our clients have always been national, and even international, because our games apply to industries regardless of whether you\u2019re making steel or ketchup. We\u2019ve worked with companies all over the world, or at least that have a global presence.", "Right now we are focused on the regional targeted messaging in a big way in Pennsylvania. That\u2019s primarily as we\u2019re building out the platform, building out the games, and building out the state partners, as well as the local partners and companies we\u2019re working with. We\u2019re targeting a lot of our skillers to be from this region. That said, we\u2019re already inadvertently pulling in a lot of interest from other parts of the country. Southern California is one area. It\u2019s because the story of construction around the country is the same. The story of nursing shortages is the same. The story of soft skills is the same. But as far as proving it out, we\u2019re focused here.", "GamesBeat: It seems like a lot of people in the game-centric areas might not chase after that. They wouldn\u2019t spot this kind of opportunity. When you teach about this subject at the ETC, do you talk about it in a different way with students?", "Trybus:", " The ETC is primarily project-based. My title actually has \u201cProfessor of Practice\u201d in it. The idea is, I\u2019m in industry making a lot of games with a lot of different clients, focusing on the problem we\u2019re solving. I bring that back in and focus on process with the students. I try my best to ask questions that they can think about and explore, but at the end of the day the students will work on interdisciplinary teams, which is a big deal. They\u2019ll have a client and they\u2019ll go through the process of concepting, prototyping, playtesting, iteration, publishing to the app stores\u2014it\u2019s a soup to nuts experience in 16 weeks, with a real client.", "I bring what I see as best practices, I hope, back in. But it\u2019s similar. It\u2019s very similar to what we do here. It\u2019s just that these teams have 12 years of experience through many iterations.", "GamesBeat: Is the ETC graduating anyone with this kind of specialization, like training simulation?", "Trybus:", " There\u2019s certainly a specialty \u2014 I think Jesse tried to coin the term \u201ctransformational games.\u201d There\u2019s a specialty in looking at games for other than entertainment purposes. But the fact of the matter is, nine out of 10 projects we did 10 years ago or more were straight entertainment, whether it was theme parks or 3D/4D movies or console games. Today, arguably, nine out of 10 projects at the ETC are edutainment, or something that is about a way to effectively communicate, whether it\u2019s theme park or game design. So to answer your question, yes, there are people who are very interested in pursuing things like serious games or transformational games, educational games for kids, but it\u2019s naturally leaning toward that anyway.", "Above: Simcoach Games creates simulations of real-life jobs.", "GamesBeat: Since there is that broader category of serious games, is there competition in the field of what you\u2019re doing?", "Trybus:", " Our competition over the years has primarily been the traditional passive training solutions that were in companies. Now it\u2019s the recruiting, the job boards, anything that has to do with workforce development and training. That\u2019s our major competition. A lot of studios have come and gone or stayed around the country and around the world doing one-off projects using games for learning. That\u2019s all over the place.

Is that in the same space?", "Trybus:", " We\u2019ve had some crossover in the past, especially early on. If I remember correctly, they came out of the Department of Defense side of it. Early on, our competitors were mainly funded by Defense or came out of that kind of work.", "GamesBeat: Military training?", "Trybus:", " Right, or health care, but with government funding either way. I don\u2019t know of other companies that have been around as long as we have that started by going straight for industry.

I\u2019m not sure if anybody really measures that.", "Trybus:", " At the time the government was huge, but the market to use this kind of technology to solve industry problems has certainly grown, and is growing. Especially now that we have the proliferation of mobile devices. It\u2019s all in the cloud. It\u2019s all trackable. That didn\u2019t exist 10 years ago.", "GamesBeat: It sounds like it was a big boiling-the-ocean test to get it started.", "Trybus:", " You\u2019re right. Looking back, I agree with you. One of our challenges has always been the potential to lose focus, because we get a lot of people calling and saying, \u201cHey, can you build me a game for X-Y-Z?\u201d And we have, especially when we bootstrapped the company to get to our core solution, which is the Simcoach Skill Arcade. We built a lot of great games that won\u2019t fit into the Skill Arcade, but that\u2019s what balanced the business and taught us how to build great games.", "GamesBeat: You would favor creating something that fits in the Arcade over something that\u2019s just a one-off?", "Trybus:", " Yeah, because we\u2019re focused on a scale solution. We want to collect the data around career readiness so we can license it, because we think that information and the skillers that are signing up will be really valuable to these industries or potential employers.

Early on our games were focused on corporate training, often around safety. To be able to build a video game that we could reasonably say saved lives \u2014 that was pretty cool. Now we\u2019re building video games that have changed lives, in the sense of bringing people from underserved populations into places where they have career opportunities. That\u2019s the core thing.", "The other piece of it, to me, is just getting to learn new things and interact with lots of different people, and then the challenge of translating all of that into games.", "GamesBeat: I\u2019m most familiar with entertainment games, but what makes a good training program?", "Myers:", " The overlap, if you do it right, is really quite large. I subscribe to Raph Koster\u2019s notion that fun is what we experience when our brains are learning. If we build our games right, we end up with a fun game that also happens to be \u2014 the core learning happens to be about whatever the topic is. Things that are key to that are the same things that are key to good games: challenge, meaningful interaction, well-defined goals, things like that. You see all those things together in both entertainment games and educational games. In an educational game it all comes around learning objectives that are specified up front.", "GamesBeat: What do you think has been your most impactful game, out of all 150 or so?", "Myers:", " Honestly, maybe it\u2019s because I was just in a meeting talking about it, but one of our more recent games is called Booeys. It\u2019s a game intended to serve as a pathway into tech-related careers, STEM-related careers. It\u2019s a little puzzle game where you essentially program a little ghost to achieve little objectives. It encourages you as you go along. If you\u2019re succeeding, the ghost character comes up and tells you nice things and eventually encourages you to reach out to resources where you can potentially get training toward a tech career.", "The numbers right now are pretty small, but we have a concrete pipeline from downloading the game to playing the game to reaching out for resources to actually ending up in tech skills boot camps. We have people who\u2019ve gone through that entire pipeline and who are either in a boot camp now or moving into careers that were otherwise not open to them. We\u2019re working on increasing the numbers now, but to me that\u2019s such a tangible story of impacting someone\u2019s life.", "Trybus:", " We also have evidence \u2014 the numbers are in the dozens only, but evidence of the success of the game lining up with the success of the boot camp program that sets you up for being successful in a job. That\u2019s pretty significant so far.", "Above: Carnegie Mellon\u2019s soccer field.", "GamesBeat: It seems like it\u2019s hard to measure in some ways. Sometimes a person might wind up in a career years from now, but they were exposed through your games.", "Myers:", " Right. They may be predisposed. I don\u2019t necessarily see that as a knock, other than we\u2019re providing another avenue for those people. Another big game \u2014 we built version one a couple of years ago, and we\u2019re building a more modern version now \u2014 is a game called Future Road Builders that\u2019s intended to help people decide if they\u2019re interested in a career in construction, and then choose a trade within construction.", "What\u2019s interesting about that one is that it\u2019s another game designed as a pathway into a career. But in that case, pre-qualifying people is a part of it. We\u2019re happy with someone playing it and deciding they never want to go into construction, because you don\u2019t want to waste everyone\u2019s time if you apply to an apprenticeship, get in, and halfway through your first year you realize you don\u2019t like it. On the other hand, if you go through that and decide you do want to work in construction, ending up in the right trade is the next important choice. If we can help people make that choice, that serves a purpose that makes me feel good.", "Trybus:", " I think, in addition \u2014 there\u2019s a lot of different games that I think have had really positive impact for different reasons. We talked about the history of safety. Even related to what we\u2019re building now for some of the trades \u2014 when you go down a negative path and talk about knocking stuff over and you see your character blow up or fall or whatever, it\u2019s really because of your choices, or lack of choices, the right choices. Those kinds of things have been impactful as far as taking that seriously and pursuing that further.", "GamesBeat: How are you recruiting people into the company? Is there a particular pitch that\u2019s successful at attracting people as employees?", "Myers:", " We have really strong ties to the ETC at CMU. That\u2019s a huge recruiting pipeline. The Art Institute, locally, is another source of artists \u2014 both people coming out and folks who are further down the line of their career. On the business side we have other avenues, typically through school communities or programs that arise around education. That\u2019s a big one. The development community \u2014 in terms of games, but also tech in general \u2014 is just exploding around here. There\u2019s more and more talent available. There\u2019s a lot of competition for jobs.", "GamesBeat: When you launch a game, are you the ones doing the best job of drawing the audience, or do the companies you work with serve that purpose? Do they advertise or otherwise pull people into the game?", "Trybus:", " We\u2019ve been talking about the best ways to do that. It\u2019s probably the combination of a bunch of things. Typically we\u2019re trying to work with our development partners and content partners to get it out. We have some other ideas on how to cross-promote. I talked with someone who might be developing a game with a specific audience, but if they put that game on our platform that has all the Skill Arcade users, they\u2019re essentially able to get cross-promotion from other games. You can see that network growing and working to help others. But right now it\u2019s fair to say that we\u2019re leaning on the industries and development partners we work with, building up from there as far as how to promote our games.", "Above: Simcoach Games works with Pennsylvania\u2019s state government on games that simulate roadside construction jobs.", "GamesBeat: I can see a health care company advertising this on TV, something like that.", "Myers:", " Future Road Builders is a great example. Our organizational partner, the Constructors Association of Western Pennsylvania, literally puts futureroadbuilders.com on all of their materials. They\u2019ve convinced their trade union partners to do the same thing. Whenever we go visit one of the apprenticeship centers, something like that, they always have flyers out.

According to Pitchbook\u2019s latest analysis, Limited Partners (LPs) remain committed to the asset class with 87 percent of VC funds hitting their targets, tracking 2017 as the ninth consecutive year the percentage of funds to hit their target has increased. On the deal front, value has increased 53 percent since 4Q 2016 as VCs focus on a high number of mega-financings and pull back on the angel and seed stage. The exit market is also on the mend following a dismal 2016, with five VC-backed unicorn IPO exits, pacing 2017 as having the most unicorn exits ever.", "On the heels of a record fundraising year in 2016 ($41 billion), LPs continue to show strong interest in the asset class, with 58 VC funds raised in Q2 contributing an additional $11.4 billion of dry powder. This quarter there were several groundbreaking funds raised, most notably New Enterprise Associates 16, which raised a $3.3 billion fund, making it the largest VC fund raised to date. Additionally, first-time fund managers hit the ground running in the first half of this year with $1.5 billion raised across 15 funds \u2013 the highest level of first-time fundraising activity in the past decade. The increased interest in first-time fund managers is likely attributed to their hyper-focus on specific niche markets attracting investor interest (for example, financial services-focused Centana Growth Partners and real estate-minded Fifth Wall Ventures). Coupled with its characteristic smaller vehicles and attainable targets, first-time fund managers have been well-received by LPs in Q2.", "In the second quarter, deal count and value increased considerably with $21.78 billion deployed across 1,958 companies, up from $15.9 billion invested in 1,954 companies in Q1 2017. What differentiates Q2 from earlier quarters is deal size \u2013 Q2 saw 34 transactions of at least $100 million in value, up from just 12 transactions in Q1. Thus far, 2017 is pacing to have the largest number of rounds of at least $50 million in the last decade. The strong fundraising environment has allowed VCs to pump more capital into later stages companies looking to continue growing and scaling before considering an exit. In fact, the top 10 deals of the quarter accounted for $4.3 billion, representing nearly 20 percent of all dollars invested in Q2.", "Meanwhile, the number of completed angel and seed transactions has now declined for eight consecutive quarters. What\u2019s more, first-time financings are being completed at the lowest proportion of any year, compared to the number of overall deals. Just 29 percent of completed financings in 2017 have been first-time funding rounds. The primary reason for the decline in these stages is a fundamental change in how startups are fundraising early on. For instance, the prevalence of incubators and accelerators has helped early stage startups refine their business model and secure capital at the outset, delaying the need to seek out traditional VC. Additionally, it\u2019s never been cheaper to start a business thanks to advancements in technology \u2013 companies can now operate on a smaller amount of capital for longer periods of time, further reducing the urgency for angel and seed financing.", "On the heels of one of the slowest years on record for all VC-backed IPOs in 2016, the first half of 2017\u00a0 has already experienced historic IPO activity. Only halfway through the year, we\u2019ve already seen five unicorn IPOs (MuleSoft, Snap, Okta, Cloudera, and Blue Apron), with another on deck (FourScout). So 2017 is on pace to hold the record for most unicorn IPOs, beating out 2015 with seven. But this uptick in unicorn public debuts has been a long time in the making. As companies take longer to work through each stage of financing, lifecycles have extended, allowing more time to gradually increase valuations. At last count, the average time to exit stood at roughly six years, up from less than five years a decade ago.", "Overall, exit activity continues to slide, with $10.5 billion in exit value across 156 transactions in Q2, down from $17.2 billion in value via 211 exits this same period last year. While the lack of exits can be troublesome for VCs, the market is adapting to a new norm characterized by outsized exits. The four largest exits so far in 2017 have accounted for 48 percent of the total exit value. Furthermore, startups acquired so far this year have secured a median exit post-valuation of $160.5 million, which exceeds peak levels in 2014 at $120 million. These outsized exits are attracting private equity investors. This quarter\u2019s report shows an increase in private equity buyouts as another exit route, accounting for 19 percent of exits so far in 2017, compared to 13 percent in 2016.", "The trend of companies staying private longer raises questions over the efficiency with which capital is being deployed, but VCs are determined to adjust to this dynamic and keep the venture ecosystem healthy. And their efforts are already paying off. Despite potentially delayed returns, LPs continue to show confidence in the asset class and VC\u2019s ability to create and realize value at a reasonable pace. There will continue to be lingering question marks in the new environment of mega funds and unicorns, but for now, VCs are successfully adapting.", "Nizar Tarhuni", " is Analyst Manager at ", "PitchBook", "."]}

Now, however, the time for iterative improvements are done. It\u2019s time for Destiny 2, and ahead of its September 6 launch on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One (a PC version follows October 24), I spent some time playing the closed beta on Xbox One. This test provides access to the opening story mission, a three-player cooperative Strike, and the team-based multiplayer.", "Was it enough to get me excited for the sequel? Eh.", "Above: Destiny 2 begins with the destruction of everything players fought to protect in Destiny 1.", "Let\u2019s start with that story mission, which succeeded in actually telling a story (something the first Destiny often struggled with). It quickly set up the premise of the sequel \u2014 bad guys blow up your home and take away your powers \u2014 while reintroducing characters and bringing in new ones. It was also kind of fun (and a little sad) to see the main hub from the first Destiny surrounded in chaos and fire.", "It also managed to introduce some fun elements and switch-ups. Missions in Destiny often only involved walking in a straight line and shooting things, with sequences of waiting for a door to open while fighting off waves of baddies being the only thing breaking up the monotony (although those sections became quickly\u00a0monotonous themselves). So it was nice to actually see a couple platforming sections in the mission, including one that had me running through a turbine.", "It was a flashy and exciting start for Destiny 2. If the rest of the game can maintain that level of quality, it\u2019ll be a solid campaign.", "But playing this mission also validated some fears I had going in. Destiny 2 does not feel very different from the first Destiny. And in a way, I get that. The mechanics and interface in the first game were never an issue. The shooting always felt satisfying and the menus were easy to navigate.", "Above: I don\u2019t like my new staff.", "But even beyond that stuff, it\u2019s kind of disappointing how little as changed. You can still only pick between one of three of classes: Hunter, Warlock, or Titan. I went with Hunter, as that\u2019s what I played in the first Destiny. And it felt almost exactly the same. Even the stuff that was new, like a new staff-based super move, didn\u2019t feel very fresh. The staff, which basically lets you use a bunch of powerful melee and short-distance projectile attacks, behaved almost identically to the Hunter\u2019s old Bladedancer shtick.", "Each class also has a new class ability that helps give them more of a role in group play. Warlocks can put down a healing circle. Titans can raise a barrier to protect allies. Hunters, meanwhile, can do a dodge roll. It\u2019s not nearly as flashy \u2026 or as useful.", "Maybe I just got unlucky by picking a Hunter. Maybe that barrel roll is actually more useful than I understand. But it feels like my class got a bit screwed. I\u2019m basically playing exactly the same as I did before, except I can do a dumb roll every minute or so. If they aren\u2019t going to add new classes, I wish they at least did more to make the old ones feel different.", "I\u2019m also not a big fan of the new weapon class system. In the first Destiny, you had primary, special, and heavy weapons. You could equip one of each. Primary guns were more standard things like pistols or automatic rifles, special guns were more situational tools like sniper rifles and shotguns, and heavy weapons were unique, powerful items like rocket launchers and swords.", "In Destiny 2, you instead have kinetic, energy, and power weapons. Kinetic and energy weapons both use the same guns that were in the standard category in the first Destiny. They just use different ammo and are more effective against different kinds of enemies. Power weapons combines the special and heavy categories. This makes it impossible to equip a sniper rifle and a rocket launcher at the same time. Also, since power ammo is the hardest to come by, you won\u2019t be able to use your shotgun or sniper rifle nearly as often as you did in the first Destiny. It makes me feel less versatile.", "Above: A cooperative Strike.", "I enjoyed the new Strike. I was happy to see that the boss actually had mechanics and wasn\u2019t just a bullet sponge, like most bosses in the first Destiny\u2019s Strikes. I was less thrilled with the competitive multiplayer. It felt like the same sort of thing I had grown tired of in console shooters for years, plus it was hard for me to get used to aiming on a controller after I\u2019ve been spending so much time on Overwatch on the PC.", "Maybe I\u2019ll enjoy Destiny 2\u2019s multiplayer more when I can play it on a PC too, but I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s just so familiar. It\u2019s the same kind of generic shooter mutliplayer we\u2019ve seen on console games since Halo popularized the idea.", "Above: Let\u2019s go, team.", "So, yeah, I don\u2019t know. Destiny 2 seems fine. I\u2019m not crazy about some of the changes, and Hunters seem weak compared to the other classes, but content in the beta is high-quality. The story mission is interesting, and the Strike is a great challenge for a small group of friends. Multiplayer didn\u2019t grab me, but maybe I\u2019ll enjoy it more when I can try out more modes in the full game.", "But it\u2019s hard to gather much excitement about Destiny 2 from the beta. Part of the problem is that I can\u2019t try out a lot the new things that I want to see. I\u2019m curious if Destiny 2\u2019s open environments will feel more interesting with its new quest systems, but the beta doesn\u2019t let you do any exploring. You just play the story mission and then use a menu to pick the Strike or the competitive multiplayer.", "It\u2019s also weird to play a role-playing game like Destiny 2 without any character progression or loot drops.

Since the passage of regulations allowing companies to source funding from Main Street American investors, startups have been flocking to crowdfunding platforms to secure capital. But what makes a crowdfunding campaign successful? The most obvious answer is a large social following \u2014 a crowd of loyal fans that would invest their hard-earned cash in a seemingly great idea. We expected this to be the case, and we analyzed the social media followings of 233 campaigns to find evidence. But while our hypothesis holds some truth, social media may not be as important to crowdfunding success as we initially believed.", "According to the crowdfunding law, a company must have a deadline date for reaching its minimum funding target (MFT). The offering is considered closed and not open for further investments after the deadline date is reached. If a company hits its MFT on or before the deadline, it is considered funded. We analyzed all closed campaigns, whether they were funded or not. Of the 233 campaigns, 120 reached their MFT, while 113 were not funded. Our analysis looked at the Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram networks of both groups separately then together. We also considered the LinkedIn accounts of the CEOs to see if a correlation exists between the number of professional connections and the company\u2019s ability to secure funding. A surprisingly anticlimactic trend emerged: Overall, while social media appears to play a positive role in a campaign\u2019s funding, this is only true to a minor extent. The chart below shows the trend line between the funds a company raised and its social following. The trend line shows that while there is a positive correlation between size of social following and raised funds, it holds little significance.", "This doesn\u2019t mean social media is a waste of time. In fact, the importance of a social following appears to vary by industry, as shown in chart below with trendlines for different industries. For industries where a social following plays a pivotal role, such as wine and spirits or apparel, the trend is more dramatic than for other industries. The wine and spirits industry appears to maximize the power of a smaller social network. This may be because wine and spirits tends to have a following of loyal fans, particularly when looking at local brands that have a storefront presence. However, for industries that have a technical background and lower social reach, such as transportation and consumer goods, the trend is almost flat or even reversed. The key here is to understand whether your industry is one that attracts followers; if so, you may be able to leverage them for crowdfunding success. If your industry is one that doesn\u2019t attract a crowd, don\u2019t rely on your social following to fund your campaign.", "To date, California and Texas have had the most crowdfunded campaigns. With that in mind, we assessed the importance of a social media following in both states. Our data suggests that a large social network is much more important in California than Texas, as shown below. This may be due to Silicon Valley\u2019s influence in the region. Since there is more competition for venture capital, perhaps companies are leveraging crowdfunding and their social networks to signal popularity and a reason to invest. In Texas, a social following is not a determinant of campaign success. This could be due to a more direct financial approach to crowdfunding in Texas, where investors are searching for proven financial strength instead of social exposure. The implication for startups is that you should understand who you are targeting with your campaign and focus your social media outreach on that. A deeper analysis of other states is in order, but there simply is not enough activity in other states to make a judgement.", "We came across one of the most telling findings when we compared the top 20 campaigns, all of which raised above $500,000, to those that raised precisely zero. The top 20 campaigns had a clear advantage in social media following. On every platform, the top 20 campaigns far exceeded the non-starters in number of followers. It seems almost as if the campaigns that raised no money were intentionally avoiding social media. The chart below displays the total social following for the top 20 and the nonfunded campaigns and suggests that social media plays an essential role on each side of the spectrum. If you want to raise $1,070,000, the most that is permitted by law, you should focus some resources on building a fan base. Beyond these three networks is the LinkedIn following for the CEOs of each startup. As expected the LinkedIn following for the top 20 far exceeded that of the bottom campaigns. On average, the nonfunded campaign CEOs had 32 connections on LinkedIn, while the top 20 CEO\u2019s had 414 connections. This discrepancy suggests that a CEO\u2019s professional network plays a vital role in the start-ups success on crowdfunding platforms.", "Our data included information for four major social media platforms: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn, in order of importance. Each social platform has its own benefits, but the one that stands out in crowdfunding is Facebook. It is almost as if Facebook is the center of a successful campaign. So at a minimum, make sure you have a Facebook presence.", "All things considered, the data suggests that the more money a company hopes to raise, the more it should focus on developing a social platform. But results vary by type of industry as well as the type of investor a company hopes to attract. However, companies hoping to raise less than $100,000 may not need to invest as much time on social media and could just use crowdfunding as a tool to speed up funding from pre-existing relationships. Nonetheless, some sort of following is essential, as the campaigns that raised no money demonstrate.", " Sherwood Neiss is a partner at ", "Crowdfund Capital Advisors", ".
