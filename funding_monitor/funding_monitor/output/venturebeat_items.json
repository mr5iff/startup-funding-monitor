Surely, this has significantly hindered MessageBird\u2019s growth so far?", "\u201cIn our case, we saw customers using us for SMS and just not using us for voice because we didn\u2019t offer it before,\u201d said Vis. \u201cThe need for the voice API really is driven by our customers, who wanted us to provide the same global security and cost advantages on voice that we have been doing for SMS for some time now. We are now able to leverage our direct carrier connections on voice as well as SMS. Being bootstrapped teaches you to focus on where the most growth is coming from, and up to now that has always been our SMS products. But the need from our customers was clear \u2014 so we built it.\u201d", "MessageBird claims it has been profitable since its inception and said that it\u2019s on course to hit a $100 million revenue run rate this year.

By way of comparison, Twilio had raised north of $100 million in outside funding by the time it was reporting\u00a0", "a $100 million run rate in 2014", ", and this came shortly before it raised ", "an additional $130 million", ".", "MessageBird said that it already counts 15,000 customers globally, including DoorDash, SAP, Huawei, Amber Alert, and Heineken. One particularly notable name in its roster is Uber, which\u00a0Twilio has long claimed as a client of its own.\u00a0", "But Twilio recently revealed", "\u00a0that Uber was reducing its dependency on Twilio\u2019s technology, a move that caused Twilio\u2019s ", "stock to nosedive", ".", "Anyone who\u2019s ever used Uber will likely take for granted the app\u2019s speedy messaging functionality. You\u2019ll also note that it\u2019s possible to chat verbally with a driver through the app, rather than having to share telephone numbers manually over SMS.", "\u201cThe magic of using cloud communications to power this interaction is that both customer and rider are automatically provided with a virtual number, which means both sides of the call are anonymized,\u201d noted\u00a0Vis. \u201cDriver and customer never see each other\u2019s real number.\u201d", "With tens of millions of users globally, such a system requires a reliable infrastructure, and it\u2019s much easier \u2014 even for heavily funded companies such as Uber \u2014 to outsource some of these service, rather than building it all in-house.", "\u201cWe work with large companies that cannot afford compromised communications,\u201d continued Vis. \u201cThe quality of your communications is a direct reflection on the caliber of your business.

With its own telecommunications carrier infrastructure, MessageBird can \u201cconnect to the very core of mobile carriers,\u201d according to Vis. This effectively bypasses legacy systems that may involve multiple players and which may not be reliable. Generally speaking, the more entities involved in getting a message from A to B, the more likely there will be delays or failures. One analogy Vis used to describe its setup is the game \u201ctelephone\u201d (or \u201c", "Chinese whispers", "\u201d as its known elsewhere), whereby a message is whispered into one person\u2019s ear and then passed along to the next person until the last player in the group repeats a message that is unrecognizable to the initial whisper.", "\u201cThe same holds true for communications,\u201d said Vis. \u201cBecause of our direct carrier connections, MessageBird is essentially whispering in the last person\u2019s ear, bypassing all the people in the middle. Other companies go through all those extra hoops, and as a result security is compromised, quality is diminished, and speed is slowed \u2014 and now imagine you had to pay all those people who passed along the message. That is what happens in communications.\u201d", "One interesting facet of MessageBird\u2019s recent past is its participation in the American seed-stage accelerator program, Y Combinator (YC). Though MessageBird was technically a seed-stage company in terms of funding, YC is generally geared toward early-stage startups \u2014 not companies that are already generating millions in revenue. So what was the story behind the YC tie-up?", "\u201cWe were growing so fast that it afforded us a moment to reflect and fine-tune our vision as to where we wanted to go as a company,\u201d Vis said. \u201cIt also provided us with a huge network of portfolio companies we saw as potential customers in the U.S. market. The way I look at YC, it\u2019s more like Harvard for founders, where they really drill you on focus and basics that apply to companies at any stage.\u201d", "One specific learning that Vis gleaned from his company\u2019s involvement with YC was a mantra stipulating that \u201cgrowth\u201d is about retaining customers, not just acquiring them. \u201cIt seems really logical, but it changed the way we looked at customer success, and we increased our revenue expansion rate from 140 percent prior to YC to 170 percent after it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a huge advocate for companies joining YC at any stage, especially larger companies outside of the U.S. wanting to enter the U.S. market.\u201d", "MessageBird now lays claim to the biggest-ever series A investment for a Y Combinator company.", "\u201cWhile many companies have significant traction when they enter YC, MessageBird was one of the largest companies by revenue to ever complete the program,\u201d added\u00a0Y Combinator partner Ali Rowghani.", "Today, MessageBird has offices in its native Amsterdam, as well as in San Francisco, Singapore, and Sydney. In addition to funding its push into voice, the company said it will use its fresh cash bounty to fund new hires, including in customer support, and to consider acquisition options in the U.S., Europe, and Asia.", "One luxury of being a self-funded startup is that you don\u2019t have to worry about exits \u2014 being acquired or going public doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re getting customers and garnering revenue. While this funding helps MessageBird scale in key markets such as the U.S., doesn\u2019t it also give them an extra problem to worry about?", "\u201cWe specifically chose investors who have a long-term vision and will not put pressure on us to think about this [exiting] for a while,\u201d said Vis. \u201cIt happens to be that ", "both investors", " just ", "raised their investment funds", ", so we are good for the next 10 years to not have to worry about this.

He\u2019s been on a bit of a down slide and Theo is on his way up. We think that\u2019s going to be an interesting match. That also pits Team Echo Fox versus Team Rogue, with Theo being Echo Fox and Slayer being Rogue.", "In the feature matches, we have an interesting one up top. Low Tier God, who everyone considers a streamer, not a pro player, but he\u2019s won his first two fights at Body Count one and two. So we\u2019ve increased his competiton. We\u2019re throwing him against Nick Tanella. This is one where if he wins, he might be due a title shot, which might be interesting for a guy everyone considered more of an influencer or streamer than a pro player. And then Nubcakes against Crazy on the Injustice 2 side, he just took number two this week at a stacked Wednesday night fight card, because all of the players are in Socal.", "He went up in Injustice against the best of the best and came out second. I won\u2019t say it\u2019s out of nowhere, because he\u2019s a good player, but it\u2019s a little bit out of nowhere. He\u2019s on the undercard as well. It should be a good night of fights. Logistically we\u2019re running buses from the Anaheim Convention Center to the esports arena to put fans and players in the building. This is the first time we\u2019re doing it somewhere that\u2019s not in our studio, so we have more capacity for seating. We\u2019ve added food and beverage to the night.", "GamesBeat: I like the setup you have with the fight card and the belts and things like that. Do you know if any other esports organizations are working this way? Or is it typically a team system and tournaments and competitions like that?", "Dimberg:", " By and large what you have in any of the esports are tournament-based systems. The ESL obviously puts on a lot of tournaments and they do a great job of that. This is a different take on the esports equation from us. I think we\u2019re unique in that format. Distribution-wise we\u2019re seeing the publishers get behind it. We just got in\u2014we\u2019re obviously going to be streaming to our own channels for Body Count Fighting, and also our partners at Level Up Series, but also just got confirmation that we\u2019ll be streaming the Tekken portions of the show to Bandai Namco\u2019s Twitch, and the Injustice portions to NetherRealm\u2019s Twitch.", "The publishers themselves are getting behind the format in addition to the players themselves. Again, the players love it. They carry their belts around sometimes at other tournaments. They like that this format puts them and their rivalries, so to speak, front and center.", "They\u2019re frenemies, sometimes minus the \u201cfre\u201d part \u2013 just enemies \u2013 but it\u2019s all in the spirit of good competitions. It allows us to showcase those people who\u2014they say in traditional fighting that styles make fights. In some cases that\u2019s true on the FGC side as well. It\u2019s who they play as, their fighting style, a zoner versus a body fighter. It allows us to tee this up so we have an entertaining night for the fans.", "Arons:", " I feel like something interesting is happening, which is that a\u00a0lot of esports got in the news because League of Legends and Dota 2 have million-dollar cups and arenas full of fans. That\u2019s great, and it definitely became what people started to hear and think about when it comes to esports. [But] what I like is on the other side. What we\u2019ve gone back to is an old-fashioned fighting competition where the people really know each other.They\u2019re in this circuit together.", "At any given time there\u2019s two opposite trends happening \u2013 more people are dieting than ever but ice cream sales have never been higher, things like that. I feel like that\u2019s happening with esports. These massive events are getting bigger, but there\u2019s also this other side of the competition that we\u2019re supporting, which is back to how video games began in the arcades. Guys standing around playing each other.", "Dimberg:", " I think an unintended consequence of what we\u2019re doing, long term\u2014I do see the players really latching on to this format. I think they like it. But it changes the way they train a bit. Here you have one night, one opponent, and you know it well in advance usually. You know what their mains are, the characters they play with, so you can train and prepare for a specific opponent. As opposed to entering a tournament where you don\u2019t know who you\u2019re going to play from round to round necessarily. The winners of those tournaments, with some exception\u2014I think of guys like Sonic Fox in Injustice 2, who just seem to win everything because they\u2019re that good. But by and large players catch hot streaks just like any athlete.", "Tournaments show who is hottest at the time. In this case what we hope to get to is\u2014it\u2019s me versus him or her. I know in advance. I\u2019m going to train and prepare for that person. It raises the personal stakes for them a bit, because they put time and energy into training to meet this known opponent, who they pretty well know as far as who they\u2019re going to play as and what their fighting style is. It changes the dynamic a bit. You spend a long period of time preparing for one fight. Which I think will raise some of the drama as we go on.", "GamesBeat: I can see the value in that for sure. Can I ask, how do you make sure it doesn\u2019t end up feeling like a gimmick? I don\u2019t think the way you present it feels like a gimmick, but it can come across a bit like American Gladiators or WWE, something people don\u2019t take too seriously. Are folks taking it seriously? What are you guys doing to facilitate that?", "Dimberg:", " Absolutely. I think the players themselves absolutely take it seriously. They look at it as a pride thing, right? But the American Gladiators thing versus WWE\u2014I\u2019ll say very clearly that the competition is absolutely real. I\u2019d say UFC is a better proxy. The competition is real. What I do talk to the fighters and the players about is that, to use the UFC analogy, Conor MacGregor is the biggest personality in that sport. He happens to be really good, but he also has a fiery personality that draws a lot of people to him who aren\u2019t necessarily always UFC fans, but they just can\u2019t take their eyes off this guy.", "So there is something to be said for being good, but also being charismatic. We do work on those sorts of things. In terms of their fighting, again, we invite them on. We talk to them about how they train. We showcase, again, if you look at things like the Chasing the Cup series, we show the amount of time these players put into this. A lot of these guys, it\u2019s not uncommon for them to practice 12-14 hours a day. I\u2019m someone who\u2019s very much an avid gamer, but I can\u2019t imagine playing one game 12-14 hours a day.", "There\u2019s a mental fortitude that goes into that training that I don\u2019t quite get. I can\u2019t fathom it. We try, at every turn, to showcase that this just isn\u2019t some guys who sat down and grabbed a controller while we threw spotlights on them. These guys work hard and train to perfect their craft. Most of them are sponsored. This is their profession. This is what they do for a living. In the format we\u2019re providing we give them an opportunity to showcase their skills against someone else who\u2019s probably training as hard and is as professional, to see who comes out on top.", "Ultimately what we hope to gather from that is there\u2019s more drama in this sort of format for the end viewer, while still maintaining the level of competition and need to train and prepare for the fighter. Again, it was just trying to see\u2014I\u2019ll use something I said earlier. To promote a good fight, to bring an audience into a fight, is obviously hitting the fans. What I hope to do with this is broaden the top of the funnel for the FGC. Build drama and story that pulls in people who don\u2019t normally or wouldn\u2019t necessarily give an esports competition a second look.", "When we talk internally I talk a lot about the moneymaker effect in poker circa 2004. Unnamed, anonymous online player wins the World Series of Poker and ratings for ESPN explode. What I\u2019m hoping is to put things in a format that can breed that sort of hope for the FGC. The bigger it gets, the better it gets for all of them: the more exposure they get, the more audiences watching their fights, the more prize money potentially at stake, the more sponsor dollars potentially at stake, it helps build the business for them too.", "GamesBeat: Is that where the docu-series comes in? You can help these people build up themselves and the fights simultaneously. Telling the story isn\u2019t just flavoring on top of the competition broadcast. It\u2019s crucial to the way this works. Is that correct?", "Dimberg:", " Yeah, absolutely. Again, most esports competitions come out of either long-standing tournaments, where you see things like EVO, where the most popular event is a 15-year-old Nintendo game, or on the FPS side it\u2019s games like Counter-Strike and games that have been around for a long time.", "It\u2019s not necessarily about moving units of new games, although you see that happening more as we add to it. In the case of Street Fighter and Tekken and Marvel Vs. Capcom\u2014Injustice is in its second iteration. These games have been around for a while. It\u2019s maybe new versions of them, but these guys have been playing these games for in some cases\u2013if you think about Street Fighter that goes back a long time. They\u2019ve been playing for a long time, and there\u2019s quite a community built up around fans, but again, how do I get\u2014sometimes I think this is an odd statement, but how would I get my wife, who\u2019s not a gamer, interested in watching one of these things?", "Tapping into the players helps make it more accessible for someone like her, as an example, but insert anybody who doesn\u2019t necessarily get into gaming or watch esports.", "It\u2019s something we\u2019re committed to long term. I\u2019m planning on doing 12 of these next year in 2018, one every month. They\u2019ve been successful enough, and the fighters have been engaged enough, that I think we\u2019re taking this from something\u2013we were planting a seed and hoping it worked, and now it\u2019s full-fledged, baked in our strategy for 2018. We\u2019re looking to do many more of these over the course of the next 12 to 18 months, moving them to a monthly cadence.", "Arons:", " And keep partnering with people who are really deep into this space.", "Country required", "*By checking this box, you are confirming you are an adult 18 years or older and you agree to Intel contacting you with marketing-related emails or by telephone.

I see fishing stuff all over the place.", "Gan:", " Fishing is really, really important because in fishing, you\u2019re not only fishing, but you have to put them in your own fish farm. They\u2019re different sizes, and you need them to travel around. It\u2019s an island, so to travel to some other places, some mysterious places, you need to breed and cultivate your own fish that are large enough \u2014 L size or XL size \u2014 so that you can ride them and off you go to explore the ocean, places like other islands. That\u2019s very important to the game.", "GamesBeat: Why did you decide fishing would be about both catching and raising fish?", "Gan:", " We love simulation games from when we were young. We were thinking, everyone\u2019s doing fishing. Harvest Moon had a fish farm, but you\u2019d just get a fish and dump it in your well. I can\u2019t remember which title it was, but it was definitely one of the Harvest Moons. You\u2019d breed the fish in your well, but you couldn\u2019t see them. There were just more fish. We wanted to take that to another level, where you could catch fish and breed different sizes and cultivate them. Maybe you could find a mystery egg that would hatch into a Magnus underwater.", "Spokesperson:", " It helps bridge into a bunch of features because it\u2019s also a game where you can go out and explore a lot. Having this fish-raising mechanic allows you to use those fish and explore the islands. I\u2019ve been describing this game as a sort of all-encompassing simulation RPG because it does so much, but I think it\u2019s really fitting that raising these fish then allows you to engage in so many more features.

He applies that computer history to the idea of cloud rendering. Rendering images or games is what happens when you submit your graphics or animation project, and the big computer, in this case a data center, goes to work on it. If you\u2019re like Pixar, you might wait a whole day for your next animated movie scene to come back as a full rendering. Pixar can afford to pay for that, but smaller game makers and animators can\u2019t.", "That\u2019s where blockchain comes in, and it\u2019s why Urbach is starting an Initial Coin Offering for what he calls a ", "Render Token", ". It\u2019s a blockchain-based currency that people can invest in, as it represents a distributed graphics processing unit (GPU) rendering network. Everyone with a computer can contribute the spare cycles to a collective rendering machine, when their computers aren\u2019t being used. Artists can submit their work to be rendered, and then they\u2019ll get their job done.", "The Render Token ICO kicks off on October 5. And if it works, then it will be like a brave new world, where people contribute their spare compute cycles to the cause and earn something from it. I talked to Urbach about this big idea.", "Here\u2019s an edited transcript of our interview.", "VentureBeat: Do you want to talk about why you\u2019re going the ICO route, and explain what Render is as part of that?", "Jules Urbach:", " Render is a way of solving a problem that I foresaw years ago. There\u2019s a patent from 2009 that reflected my view. The idea behind the token sale is something that I was thinking about well before I knew anything about the state of cryptocurrency and Bitcoin and Ethereum and all these ideas that have come out of the blockchain. I had always imagined, five or 10 years down the line, that things would be getting built through Octane for rendering. The rendering power for that needed to be more than one person could provide, or even a couple. And so I came up with a few ideas and patents around getting this to run through the millions of graphics cards that were out there.", "Even some of our earliest work for Autodesk was built around peer to peer streaming and sharing, not just the cloud-based stuff. It was through our work through Autodesk that I got a really big break. We and Autodesk triangulated, in 2013, the G2s in the cloud. It was right before than that I went up on stage with Jen-Hsun Huang at the Nvidia conference and showed Octane running on hundreds of graphics cards, knowing that Amazon would have that available within months. We launched the cloud service with that in mind. Amazon was part of making cloud rendering as we have it now in Octane, leveraging the rendering for making some crazier things like lightfields possible. If you look at our current partnerships with Facebook, what we\u2019re doing with video is still all basically Octane-rendered. With Unity we\u2019re integrated primarily to drive our AR and lightfield and volumetric rendering business.", "All those things are pushing what you need for Amazon to deliver through the roof. We have render jobs that are lightfield-based that cost $150,000. They could be cheaper, and they could be done on what\u2019s on the public cloud. We\u2019ve seen, over the last four years, the price of that not really change a lot. Our user base is in the millions now with Unity. I went back to the idea of\u2014we\u2019re going to keep all the GPUs we already have in our service, but we need a lot more. It needs to be cheaper. The best way to do that goes back to my plan to have millions of graphics cards contributing to that.", "Above: Jules Urbach, CEO of Otoy.", "VB: ", "When I talked to [Epic Games CEO] Tim Sweeney", ", he was talking about blockchain as well. He mentioned that, eventually, it\u2019s something we want to render at 60 frames per second. Right now it\u2019s updated about once every 10 minutes. That seems like an awfully big distance to go. How far away from that goal are we, technically? Is there something that helps close that gap to the point where this kind of rendering is useful?", "Urbach:", " Tim is right about the 60 frames per second. Ultimately you want to be able to deliver those actions instantaneously. There\u2019s work being done with Ethereum which is designed to basically create shards. They\u2019re basically shifting Ethereum to having multiple side chains that can validate work much faster. That\u2019s an important consideration for the future.", "But what\u2019s interesting for us is that I don\u2019t need any of that for the stuff we\u2019re doing. The first reason why is that if you look at this work as an extension \u2014 there\u2019s a lot of work that Amazon and Google computers and GPUs are doing, not just for rendering, but for other things. If you can come up with a way to deliver more and cheaper compute power for the services you do through the central\u2014the most expensive things we do at Amazon are not real time streams. They can be, but that\u2019s a small percentage of our business. You remember what we demonstrated in 2013, and we use it for Oculus and Facebook and others, but the majority of the money and the majority of our capacity issues are all about high latency jobs.", "In other words, people want a light field render within a few days. It would take them months to render it locally, if it\u2019s even possible. You just need the work to get done. In the case of light-mapping images, which is used in making games with Unity and Unreal, that\u2019s also offline. Typically a lightmap in a game takes about a day to generate before you publish it. Moving that to the cloud, again\u2014nobody needs this in an instant. The way we built this system is to replace the one-day turnaround we have with something augmented. If you want next-day service and you\u2019re doing 6K of rendering work, that\u2019s where we need to talk further. That\u2019s the big issue that I\u2019m trying to unblock here.", "Having transactions happen where we unlock 60 hours of rendering from one transaction, that\u2019s fine. That\u2019s a great way of leveraging the blockchain. That\u2019s exactly what we need. What\u2019s also interesting is that ultimately, a lot of blockchain issues \u2014 transactions happening at 60 cycles per second, that\u2019s not what we\u2019re trying to do. I\u2019m looking at this as I\u2019m building blocks of reality. We\u2019re literally rendering a simulation of light. We\u2019re at the point where we\u2019re able to measure the benchmark for that so well \u2014 today, render farms, whether they\u2019re rendering or not, they measure their efficiency and the value of what they\u2019re delivering in Octane bench per dollars.", "This token is an even smaller measurement of work, Octane bench work. What we deliver right now on the cloud service is in $5 increments. The cost is designed to go down. The cost is driven by the fact that the demand for rendering is so high that we have to fulfill a lot of the work through Amazon at the cost that Amazon provides.", "Above: Color Noise by Linus Zoll", "VB: To summarize a bit, then, the cost for cloud rendering has dramatically improved over the years, but it\u2019s hit a wall of some kind? The cost hasn\u2019t come down as fast as you would like more recently? Is this the next step to shake that loose again?", "Urbach:", " Right. It\u2019s on two fronts. I was part of the launch of Amazon\u2019s GPU services in 2013, the ones we use today to do rendering. The price they launched at in 2013 is basically identical to the price today, even though they\u2019ve upped the GPUs to the G3. The GPU work is no different from it was in 2013. That\u2019s not great. We haven\u2019t seen any serious competition to that pricing from Google or any others. That might change. It\u2019s expected to.

When we could leverage thousands of GPUs per job\u2014a lot of our rendering jobs are art assets, and a lot of them could be knocked out to a thousand GPUs. The problem is, as we grow our business and we get even 10 customers per day who want to render these kinds of jobs\u2014that will happen with AR, as volumetric rendering becomes so important, and in games. We don\u2019t have those GPUs at Amazon. So the pricing and the capacity are the areas that need to get solved.", "What\u2019s fascinating is that there\u2019s another dimension of real world problems we have. You have so much GPU power being used today to mine cryptocurrency. We\u2019ve found for the first time this year that our customers, they want to be running machines locally to render Octane faster, and the actual hardware isn\u2019t available, because the miners have bought up all these cards and there aren\u2019t any left. We look at how much power it takes to run Bitcoin \u2014 it\u2019s larger than most countries, a huge amount of energy. It\u2019s sucking away energy and GPUs, and it doesn\u2019t do anything. Mining cryptocurrency doesn\u2019t do anything valuable other than just creating a token. That gets more and more expensive every day, the more the blockchain grows.", "One of the goals I had with this system \u2014 it\u2019s just about the right timing for us to have it so you can make more money consistently from pulling that render job at that cost than you would from, essentially, pulling the lottery lever and seeing if you get an Ethereum coin. Right now, mining for Bitcoin, you\u2019re not going to get anywhere."]}

It seems like we\u2019re still waiting for the point where it\u2019s in line with other consumer electronics devices \u2014 $299, $399 \u2014 where someone can try out VR, have a great time, and not get hit by sticker shock when they find out how much their own headset would cost.", "Pallister:", " That\u2019s the goal with what we and Microsoft are trying to do. Can you take a sub-$300 headset and say, \u201cThis will work on the notebook you were going to buy, anyway?\u201d You don\u2019t have to change the notebook you were going to buy and get a high-end gaming machine. You can buy the notebook you wanted anyway and have a great set of experiences. If you want to play high-end 3D games, if you want to play Raw Data, then you\u2019ll buy a different machine.

Phillips", "content": ["As a filmmaker and movie aficionado, watching viewers delight in VR entertainment as enthusiastically as they do hit movies is rewarding, which makes it an honor to create virtual reality experiences for beloved movie franchises. But creating VR that will pass muster with passionate fans of a blockbuster franchise is not an easy undertaking.", "In order to succeed with VR projects for the major studios, creators have to understand some critical rules of the game. Being associated with a revered movie franchise doesn\u2019t guarantee the success of these experiences. Hard work goes into crafting gripping virtual reality experiences that best represent the films that inspired them and attract even more fans to the box office. It also helps to have forward thinking creative executives at the studio that are willing to take risks on this emerging technology.", "Working on virtual reality experiences for hit movies, such as Warner Bros.

Where the goal of VR for major film franchises is to bring lasting fans on board, the opposite could result if viewers aren\u2019t pleased. Storytelling is paramount and often overlooked but it\u2019s the most important thing to consider when conceptualizing these experiences. VR experiences for films \u2014 often released before the films, thus acting as previews \u2014 can conceivably impact the commercial success of the motion picture. An experience must be in careful sync with key plot points and franchise story arcs to win over audiences. At their best, large franchise experiences give users the thrill of having the chance to \u201cbecome\u201d or \u201cmeet\u201d their favorite movie heroes and villains or step into pulse-pounding action.", "Achieving a balance of proper experience length, content, and suspense makes for a successful film studio VR project. VR Experiences that do a really interesting job of horror in the VR space include Guy Shermaldine\u2019s Webby Award-winning ", "Catatonic", " experience influenced many of us in VR filmmaking. It was clear that Guy was very clever about how to present it. The activation is great as they have these nurses standing next to wheelchairs waiting for you to put on the headset. They place the headset on you and there you are in a wheelchair, but now in a mental institute \u2014 a perfect example of how VR experiences can and should be treated as events beyond just putting on a headset.", "Here They Lie", ", a game created by Tangentlmen for PSVR, also works really well. It has this great monochromatic look to it and is almost devoid of jump scares. It\u2019s all ambiance, and to me is one of the most visceral experiences in the space. It speaks to how effective the medium can be at tapping into real human emotions and how we experience fear.", "A second key to success VR creators must understand is the need to live up to the high production values attained by top-tier studio films. A creator\u2019s job is to get people invested in the characters and be absorbed by the world of the film and become lifelong fans. Towards that end, it\u2019s been helpful for us to spend time on set during production for the films. There, we have the unique opportunity to study each filmmaker\u2019s vision, as well as see them direct actors from the film and get to the heart of their performance. As a result, we better understand what the filmmakers are developing with these characters and how to include their cinematography techniques in the creative for each VR experience.", "Filmmakers can also provide insight on such details as setting, consistent lighting, and even the effects of believable sound in VR \u2014 achieved through spatial audio. Sound is a factor not to be overlooked when you\u2019re looking to maximize the impact of an experience. VR is changing so fast, after all, that every project brings new tool sets. We may use new cameras or DIY rigs, for example, and we depend on the assistance of film engineers and cinematographers to shoot successfully.", "Keeping these critical components in mind, my team and I typically come up with a viable story line first. Creating a complete story-driven experience is always our first priority. Then, we turn to the expertise of our creative partners working in film to come to the studio and contribute to the process of shooting, post production and valuable plot insight.", "Lastly, VR creators producing experiences for major films must find new ways to use this evolving medium. Creators must raise the technical bar every time an experience is created, in order to keep a young, tech-savvy audiences engaged and \u2014 quite literally \u2014 thrilled. Not only must the experience be free of technical glitches, but it must also add something to the movie\u2019s narrative in a way that warrants the use of VR technology. Experiences where VR is perceived by audiences as an afterthought to the film, or a tacked-on gimmick to hop on the latest trend, often come under attack.", "Innovation occurs when you assemble a talented crew of artists that are as passionate about the medium and the project as you are. VR has given many young, talented artists in production, post and VFX the opportunity to cultivate their talents without the hierarchy that comes in other disciplines. At SunnyBoy we are constantly experimenting and learning new things. It\u2019s exciting for all of us to be involved in the creation of a new art form and we appreciate how rare it is to have this opportunity to truly discover something before the rules have been written.", "We are also believers in the community and taking in what others in the VR space are setting out to accomplish. VR experimentation is constant, and just like any other art form, creators have to study the work of leading contemporaries. On the flip side, VR is in such a nascent stage right now that nearly anything goes, as long as it\u2019s creative and insightful. It\u2019s not as critical to be ahead of the trends, but to be a part of writing the language for this new medium. The way to do that is to consume content and isolate what works and what is unique for your own practice. Every time I watch new experiences \u2014 while they may not work as whole \u2014 I always find an aspect or quality that I haven\u2019t seen before and store that away for the next project.", "Using these three keys to success, our experiences have represented their movie franchises well and left fans excited by another story being added to their favorite film\u2019s universe.", "Craig S.

The St. Paul,       Minnesota company ", "Urban       Organics", ", which uses aquaponics to raise fish and grow leafy greens,       has already proven the viability of an idea that\u2019s been getting national       attention: year-round indoor farming. In fact, Urban Organics has been       so successful in its pioneering approach that it recently added a second       larger location to meet skyrocketing local demand for its fresh arctic       char and salmon, and organic greens including bok choy, kale, lettuce,       arugula, chard, and spinach.

", "      In a sector of the food industry seeing substantial growth of new       entrants, Urban Organics offers a highly differentiated approach to       vertical farming that addresses market demand for both local and organic       produce and protein. Unlike typical hydroponic farming operations, the       Company can supply produce that is USDA-certified organic by using       solids produced in its fish culturing system as the nutrient source for       the produce. Using natural waste products from one system as the primary       input of another has substantial economic advantages and represents a       far more environmentally sustainable and resource conservative approach       to urban food production.    ", "      In 2014, the company opened its first indoor urban aquaponics farm       inside an old St. Paul brewery complex \u2013 the former Hamm\u2019s Brewery. Its       8,500 sq. ft. became home to a fully-operational farm which housed four       3,500 gallon fish tanks with 4,000 hybrid striped bass plus herbs and       leafy greens-one of the largest and most advanced aquaponics facilities       in the country.

", "      The Hamm\u2019s farm proved the concept, as area restaurateurs and grocers       demanded more ultra-fresh, ultra-local product than the location could       provide. Global water company Pentair, with its main U.S. offices in       Minnesota, was an early supporter of the Hamm\u2019s location \u2013 designing,       engineering and installing the innovative system with its water       filtration and reuse technologies. After the success of the Hamm\u2019s       location, Pentair and Urban Organics joined forces and expanded to a       larger space in another unused urban brewery building-the 87,000 square       foot Schmidt complex, which is in the middle of a revitalization       including artists\u2019 condos and a planned food hall.    ", "      That new Urban Organics Schmidt brewery location opened earlier this       summer. Its 87,000 sq. ft. are home to 14 fish tanks and 50, 5-tier       towering racks of greens, and when it reaches full capacity later this       year, it will provide 275,000 lbs. of fresh fish and 475,000 lbs. of       produce per year to the surrounding region. The USDA-certified-organic       farm has created jobs, brought life back into abandoned buildings,       provided a global model for indoor aquaponics farming, and done it all       without the use of pesticides \u2013 and while using significantly less water       than traditional methods to grow produce.    ", "      \u201cWe started this venture as social entrepreneurs who wanted to figure       out how to bring a reliable source of healthy foods into areas that had       to rely on food transported in from far away,\u201d said Dave Haider,       co-founder of Urban Organics. \u201cIt turned out that our wild idea also       made a lot of sense to a community hungry for organic,       sustainably-raised food, and to other innovators around the world who       had been asking the same questions we were. By collaborating with       Pentair, we\u2019re able to contribute beyond our immediate region-we\u2019re able       to test and perfect the technologies that will make a global impact       advancing the field of large-scale commercial aquaponics.\u201d    ", "      Urban farming is an extremely competitive endeavor, but Urban Organics       continues to add products and customers. Earlier this summer, the farm       rolled out nine different types of packaged greens and salads, now       distributed through regional coops and grocery chains. And by next       summer, arctic char growing in its tanks will be ready for harvest.       Local health care provider HealthPartners, the largest consumer-governed       health care organization in the nation, is now including Urban Organics       greens in patient meals and serving them in its cafeterias.

The planet has stopped turning, plunging one half into freezing darkness and subjecting the other to a blazing heat from perpetual daylight. Indie studio CoseBelle will launch a Kickstarter campaign on September 19 to raise the remaining funds needed to complete development on the game, but a\u00a0", "free demo is available", "\u00a0now to download on the indie platform Itch.io.", "\u201cFor Selling Sunlight, we started with the idea of a world that always faces its own sun, and built the world around that concept,\u201d said CoseBelle founder Giada Zavarise in an email. \u201cHow can people measure the passing of time in a state of constant twilight? What values does a sun-centered religion have? How are people with a dark skin considered? As we answered those questions, civilizations took shape.\u201d", "As Zavarise implies, learning about the lore is a big part of Selling Sunlight. When I played the demo, which was a short experience, I learned snippets of information about different beliefs, suggesting a world with myriad sects and cultures. Some people worshipped the sun. Others rebelled against it. One village had a tradition called the Metamorphosis, which enabled someone to take a new name and thus a completely new identity. The finished game, I imagine, will expand on these ideas.", "\u201cThe fantasy novels I prefer are the ones by authors like Ursula Le Guin and China Mi\u00e9ville: the ones that feel fantastical not because they have magic and monsters, but because they paint different cultures, different ways of living,\u201d said Zavarise.", "All these things coalesce in the protagonist\u2019s journey. You play an unnamed merchant who has committed an unspecified crime against the sun. As a punishment, you\u2019re forced to wear a mask over your face, and your identity and memories have been wiped away. The story seems to focus on how you\u2019ll decide to move forward: Do you seek to reclaim your old identity, forge a new one, or perhaps seek vengeance?", "One thing\u2019s for sure about your character: They\u2019re not a fighter. As a merchant, you interact with the world through bartering, whether that\u2019s for goods or information. When you enter a shop to purchase items, you enter \u201chaggling mode\u201d where you attempt to cajole and convince the other person to lower their price. In conversation, you can select your attitude toward someone to elicit different reactions, and they\u2019ll remember how you\u2019ve behaved toward them.", "\u201cYou\u2019re a merchant. You can\u2019t gift, nor build, anything: All your social interactions revolve around fair trading,\u201d said Zavarise. \u201cBarter with other merchants and you\u2019ll become friends. They\u2019ll tell you about their problems, and to help you\u2019ll often have to look for rare items, thus exploring new cities and meeting new merchants. It\u2019s a positive gameplay loop that rewards you for being kind.\u201d", "Though the dialogue and story are key, Selling Sunlight also looks lovely. It has a light-dappled aesthetic with rich, textured colors and hand-drawn portraits, and it uses a mishmash of art styles. Some of the backgrounds look like they\u2019ve been shaded with crayon, while the characters stand out like paper cutouts in sharp relief.", "\u201cAs for the art style, [Chiara Boscaro] and [Anita Zaramella] took inspiration from the ", "Art Nouveau movement", " and started working with watercolors because, as comic book artists, it\u2019s what they excel at,\u201d said Zavarise. \u201cIt can be an unusual choice for a game, but for us it was only natural.\u201d", "Boscaro and Zaramella are the two other full-time members of CoseBelle. They handle all the artwork, and Zavarise does everything else. Their first collaboration was on a comic book, but once the idea for Selling Sunlight crystalized, they began working on it in earnest in April 2016.", "\u201cThe project is in a pretty good shape right now: most of the core mechanics have been programmed, and now it\u2019s mostly a matter of fleshing out the world by adding more locations, characters and storylines,\u201d said Zavarise.", "They were selected for the Failbetter Games ", "incubation program", ", which aims to provide indie developers with a free workspace and mentorship. ", "Failbetter", "\u00a0has its roots in interactive fiction, and it\u2019s well known for its literary games like Fallen London, Sunless Sea, and its recently Kickstarted project ", "Sunless Skies", ".", "\u201cI get to stay in their office, drink their tea, and cry on someone\u2019s shoulder when something goes wrong,\u201d said Zavarise. \u201cMost important, I can sit in a corner during their meetings and see how a Real Game Studio works. It was an incredibly useful experience and I\u2019d recommend it to everyone!\u201d", "Country required", "*By checking this box, you are confirming you are an adult 18 years or older and you agree to Intel contacting you with marketing-related emails or by telephone.

But what has taken hold in the cryptocurrency market place in recent years stands in stark contrast to these early utopian promises. Instead, a new batch of nefarious investors are hijacking the technology for their own interests.", "The reason blockchain was an effective counter-narrative to the 2008 financial crisis is that the technology works on the presumption that no one can really trust anyone, and the only way to prevent fraud is to make all transactions universally available on a \u201cpublic ledger.\u201d This concept taps into a libertarian model of self-policing that works around the need for government regulators and major financial institutions.", "Since the launch of Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies have expanded at a feverish pace. To date, there are over 3,000 variations of blockchain technologies (into which billions of dollars have been invested).", "The latest trend in the cryptocurrency market are the initial coin offerings (ICOs), also commonly referred to as \u201ctoken sales.\u201d ICOs raise funds through a crowdfunding process similar to stock purchasing, where instead of being issued a traditional security, investors purchase a new crypto-coin which is frequently tied, directly or indirectly, to a potential money-making venture. While a small subgroup of tokens, called \u201cutility tokens,\u201d do not possess the economic features of a security, and should not be treated as such by regulators, many other tokens sold in ICOs resemble traditional stock.", "These stock-like tokens must be held accountable by a regulatory authority.", "I\u2019m bullish on the long-term view of ICOs. They can eliminate the need for companies to engage outside agents to handle financial transactions and money transfers. They also allow companies to avoid exchange rates and transaction fees, as all returns can be paid out through crypto-wallets. Cryptocurrency tokens are transmitted quickly between consumers and businesses. And, by lowering or eliminating extraneous overhead costs, businesses can offer lower initial share costs and open the option of investing to more individuals and at lower initial buy-ins. Most importantly, ICOs could completely revolutionize the existing way consumers and investors perceive basic concepts of company stock, ownership, and valuation.", "But like the intrepid housing market presaging the 2008 financial crisis, below the surface of flashy dollar signs is a rather jaundiced reality.", "A ", "recent report", " from Chainalysis, a New York-based firm that analyzes transactions and provides anti-money laundering software, revealed that not only are one out of every 10 ICOs fraudulent, but some 30,000 investors have fallen prey to ICO cybercrime, with losses totaling over $225 million.", "Many ICOs are similar to Ponzi schemes. They capitalize on hype and market frenzy, pulling in as many investors as possible to increase the value of the underlying cryptocurrency. Then, just as the value rockets upwards, the initial investors cash out or trade the tokens for other cryptocurrencies, all before the floor collapses beneath them. While the lucky few profit, the last ones out are left holding worthless digital code.", "Worse still, there is a fundamental information asymmetry in the crypto-sphere. The major players \u2013 those who are plugged into various coin networks and the blockchain \u2013 are able to accurately speculate, in nanoseconds, on the ups and downs of an ICO, which leads to drastic price fluctuations, and allows some to function as de facto gatekeepers. This type of pumping and dumping, not unlike hyper day trading, may be a form of insider trading and illegal. But absent regulation enforcement, they can continue this practice unabated.", "There is a cruel irony here: The short-sighted, profit-driven, ", "Gordon Gekko", "-types of the world, now free of the reins of traditional intermediaries and at least temporarily out of reach of government regulators, can enrich themselves on the backs of the very people who turned to ICOs because of their distrust of Wall Street. Instead of addressing these pervasive issues, the gatekeepers will instead proselytize the disruptive potential of ICOs, all the while profiting from such lip service.", "The lesson from 2008 is not that regulatory authorities are bad, it\u2019s that they need to be enforced uniformly. Absent regulators, bad actors will penetrate markets and, out of their own self interest, ruin them for everyone else.", "There are some signs of hope. The SEC ", "recently issued", " clarifications. Still, this largely falls short of what is necessary to curtail bad actors. What a regulator like the SEC needs to do is bring stability and integrity to ICOs. This starts by eliminating the scams upfront and ensuring transparency in all transactions. Disclosure laws must be followed; adherence to their guidelines will help democratize investing. The result is that a broader, bespoke class will be able to participate in revenue sharing streams traditionally reserved for high-wealth individuals and institutional investors.", "The regulations to achieve these goals are already in place. Perhaps, due to technical and design difficulties, they lack active enforcement at the moment. But the path forward for ICOs is clear. We need a regulator like the SEC to stabilize and mature the cryptocurrency market. This will ensure that investors are no longer being duped by self-aggrandizing gatekeepers and that the benefits of cryptocurrencies can finally be unleashed to the masses.", "Justin Bailey is CEO and founder of ", "Fig", "."]}

Where a company used to raise $1 million, it might now raise $20 million, and where an investor might have had to wait five years to get her money back from a purchase of illiquid startup equity, she can now sell her crypto asset an hour after buying it.", "Like derivatives, it is important to ask what crypto assets do in the context of current institutions, not in some social vacuum. Derivatives like mortgage-backed securities are a great idea. In the context of institutions full of ideological regulators, that great idea caused the Great Recession.", "And this is where we get back to the nonprofit-crypto asset connection.

Illiquidity greatly decreases value and increases risk.", "Third, constructing that type of financial product is expensive \u2014 usually (between the lawyers drafting and the lawyers reviewing it) in the six figures. This effectively divorces financial innovation from the innovators: young, startup-like nonprofits.", "Crypto assets solve all three of these problems.", "A large, growing body of investors understand crypto assets. Anyone of them can take a large risk on a worthwhile project and sell her position an hour later.

I also count crossovers as one of my guilty pleasures (I probably watched ", "The Jetsons Meet the Flintstones", " a few too many times as a kid).", "Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite, which comes out on September 18 for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, is the new entry in the series. I got to play the PlayStation 4 version (on my PlayStation 4 Pro) for my review.

The character models look a bit janky and lifeless, and ", "Capcom", " is focusing on heroes and villains from Disney\u2019s Marvel Cinematic Universe. This means no Wolverine, Deadpool, and a bunch of other iconic heroes.", "I shared those concerns.

Infinite slows things down just a bit. You have two characters on your team instead of three for the first time since the original Marvel vs. Capcom. You also can\u2019t call in allies to deliver assist attacks.", "But the fighting is still fast. If you want to win, you need to string together large combos that can go all over the place \u2014 the air, the ground \u2014 and even extend as you swap in a new character. Pulling off a huge combo still feels great.", "The action is also a bit more friendly to newcomers. Every character can pull off a basic combo by continually pushing the light punch button. It\u2019s not as easy as it sounds, since you have to learn to mix in new moves or cancel the combo into super attacks if you want to optimize your damage. But it does mean that it\u2019s easier for even a novice player to punish you if you miss an attack or aren\u2019t blocking properly.", "The mechanics are mostly similar to past Marvel vs. Capcom games, but the Infinity Stones stand out as the most significant addition. These are the same gems that you\u2019ve been watching Thor and Iron Man fret over on the big screen for the past decade. You can choose from six of them, and each one represents a different kind of power.", "Before a fight, you pick your team\u2019s Infinity Stone, and you can activate its ability with the press of a button. The Power Stone, for example, knocks enemies back. The Time Stone will teleport you forward a short distance. Using these abilities also helps charge up a new meter. When it\u2019s at least half full, you can activate an Infinity Surge. You\u2019ll then have some special benefits until that meter depletes. The Space Stone will trap the enemy player in a transparent cube, while the Mind Stone will help you quickly refill your Super meter.", "Above: Stuck in the Space Stone place.", "The campaign", "The addition of a single-player campaign is my favorite thing in Infinite. Before now, the games never bothered to justify why these two universes were suddenly together. After all, the whole series started because Capcom could easily bring in sprites from a bunch of different games (including Street Fighter Alpha and its 2D X-Men fighter).", "But Infinite\u2019s story mode actually gives us some plot. It\u2019s ridiculous. It\u2019s corny. It doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense. But it\u2019s fun. It\u2019s nice to see these characters interact with each other in ways outside of fighting. I got a few geeky chills seeing Mega Man X and Captain America standing side-by-side. Dead Rising\u2019s Frank West and Spider-Man get to share a humorous moment. Arthur from Ghosts & Goblins and Thor have more chemistry than they have any right to.", "The story revolves around Sigma (the bad guy from Mega Man X) and Ultron (one of The Avenger\u2019s chief villains) teaming up and combining the Marvel and Capcom universes. And they literally combine them. You\u2019re not just fighting in Asgard, you\u2019re fighting in an Asgard that\u2019s been combined with the opening highway level from Mega Man X. These crossover stages are just as novel as seeing Hulk smash Ryu.", "The campaign is also a great way to become familiar with the game\u2019s mechanics and most of its roster.

But it\u2019s not especially pretty. It doesn\u2019t do anything to stand out visually, but it looks fine. The character models that look stiff and dead in the eyes when you\u2019re staring at screenshots or promotional stills look much better in action, especially since the fighting always ran at a smooth 60 fps for me. But it is a safe, even boring art direction for a game with such a colorful and wacky concept.", "The presentation problems go beyond the art, though. The menus are boring.

That seems pretty big until you remember that Marvel vs. Capcom 3 started with 36, and its re-release (Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom) had a whopping 48.

You won\u2019t find Amaterasu from Okami or Viewtiful Joe here. And I\u2019d like to raise a loud objection over the lack of any Ace Attorney characters.", "To be fair, the brand new fighters in Infinite are pretty cool. It\u2019s nice to see Captain Marvel and Mega Man X finally make it in one of these games. But Infinite is only launching with five characters that are new to the series. Another six are coming as downloadable content, which stings when the roster size is already so comparably small to past entries in the series. And you\u2019ll have to spend real money to get them. Infinite doesn\u2019t have any in-game currency.", "Above: The game can still look cool.", "I know a lot of people are worried about Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite. Well, a lot of your fears are justified. The roster is lacking. The game doesn\u2019t look great (it certainly can\u2019t compete with Injustice 2 in the presentation department).", "But Infinite is still a lot of fun. It\u2019ll take fighting game experts with more proficiency than me to figure out if it has any life in the tournament scene, but I expect its fast-paced action and new Infinity Stone mechanic will attract some pros. And if you aren\u2019t planning on winning any major tournaments soon and just want to see Rocket Racoon and Dante from Devil May Cry share jokes and guns, then you\u2019ll find plenty of entertainment in the campaign.", "It\u2019s not as big and beautiful as I want it to be, but Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite still has plenty to offer.", "Score: 75/100", "Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite comes out for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on September 19.

They made Onyx to answer the simple but important questions they needed to do to their jobs.", "In most cases, Robbins said, line-level employees already know the questions they need help answering on a regular basis.\u00a0In their case, it was things like, \u201cIs there a hospital in the bay?\u201d \u201cIs this hospital open?\u201d \u201cCan we send a patient there?\u201d", "\u201cThis doesn\u2019t require general-purpose AI. It\u2019s really a little more specific, where you\u2019re able to say, \u2018We just want to provide helpful answers in real time to people that are doing really important work\u2019,\u201d he said.", "To answer questions, Orion Labs\u2019 bots plug into both real-time databases and spreadsheets maintained by customers.", "Robbins declined to state the number of clients Orion Labs works with today, but customers range from local governments and small businesses to multinational corporations.", "To fuel its bots\u2019 translation and speech understanding, Orion Labs uses a mashup of AI services from companies like Microsoft, Google, and IBM Watson.", "The $18.25 million funding round was led by Allen & Company LLC, with participation from Argentum, The Thermo Companies, Fuel Capital, and a collection of private individuals.", "Since its launch in 2013, Orion Labs has raised about $30 million. The company has 50 employees and is based in San Francisco."]}

Plans including creating new simulations for science students, as well as a plan to \u201cinitiate special projects\u201d in other regions, including South America, the Middle East, and Africa.", "\u201cBy uniting elements from the psychology of learning, virtual simulations, and gaming, Labster is helping students learn more effectively and use resources that might be otherwise impossible to access,\u201d explained Labster founder and CEO Mads Tvillinggaard. \u201cThis funding from Balderton Capital and Northzone will give us the opportunity to engage even more students globally, helping young people achieve their qualifications as well as opening up their minds to the applications of science.\u201d", "It\u2019s easy to see how Labster would appeal to both students and educational institutions, as the virtual environment circumvents the expenses and hazards of real-world experiments. There is no limit to the number of times a student can repeat an experiment through Labster, and, if nothing else, it serves as a good way to practice before attempting an experiment in a real lab."]}

They\u2019re where you meet new customers and potential partners, ", "foster existing relationships", ", and raise brand awareness. However, events can be a huge drain on your financial and company resources, and it\u2019s not always easy to decide which events you should focus your efforts on. So here are some guidelines to help startups with limited budgets determine when to attend, skip, or sponsor an event.", "Prior to deciding if your startup should participate in an event, it\u2019s important to ", "create a list of goals", ". You can use these goals to reduce the number of events you consider and ensure a targeted approach to achieve a higher ROI.", "At my company, our goal is seeing high engagement with our specific decision makers \u2014 not just general \u201cconsumer awareness.\u201d Because of that, we stay focused and ", "attend events that have relevant attendees and topics", " that can help a brand get recognition in their niche industry. Not only will potential clients have better knowledge of the respective industry, but they\u2019ll also attain a deeper understanding of who the brand really is.", "The higher number of brands in attendance, the harder it is to break through the noise. Events like SXSW and Cannes, for example, are extremely popular. They\u2019re generally interesting and have a good lineup of talks, presentations, and side events, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re right for the brand you\u2019re building. The level of investment required to participate and do something meaningful at mainstream events like these is incredibly high, and much of the audience you\u2019re paying to reach isn\u2019t even necessarily your target audience.", "Some brands ", "spend more than half of their total budget", " on branding activations, which means you\u2019ll be going up against other brands (many of whom aren\u2019t even actual competitors in your space) that are happy to put excessive resources towards bigger events. Trying to compete with the noise and saturation from these bigger brands ultimately diminishes the return on every dollar you spend at these events.", "Additionally, when you define your goals, you can optimize your work spent on events. Instead of going to hundreds of events in a year, you can go to 10 great and impactful ones that map back to your goals. The fewer events a brand attends, the more budget is available to be used toward more unique sponsorship opportunities that stand out.", "You also need to consider what your staffing situation would look like at an event. At startups, people are busy with their own job responsibilities outside of working events. You likely don\u2019t have a lot of people available for traveling to several events throughout the year, whereas bigger companies have a whole team of at least 15 dedicated to it. Sending staff to events also means taking them away from the office, which may not be so easy when you\u2019re in the early days of building a company.", "After you\u2019ve narrowed down the list of potential conferences, take a closer look and evaluate the level of impact each one can have. This includes taking a look at the approach of the event and its location and then mapping it back to your business goals and growth opportunity.", "For starters, take a closer look at the conference programming. It\u2019s worth attending if the conference has a unique approach that\u2019s different from other events you\u2019ve attended in the past. That may mean more or fewer panels, fireside chats, or breakout sessions. Clich\u00e9s in panel topics (and in participants) are rampant in most verticals. Unique and thoughtful panel topics are interesting in their own right, but they are also indicative of the overall quality of a show.", "Next, consider who\u2019s attending. You want to go to events that have relevant customers and brands. Many events suffer from \u201ctoo many sponsors\u201d syndrome. Events make money off sponsorships, and some of them are so focused on doing so that they forget they need to ensure good brands and attendees come. Although the event may initially look good, you can often end up with very few customers or potential customers to meet. In our industry, ", "Grow.co", " puts a focused effort on attracting brands and limiting the sponsors and vendors. They keep the content top-notch and focus on industry experts and media buyers driving the content instead of sponsors selling their products. Don\u2019t forget to ask partners, coworkers, or trusted friends that have attended in previous years what their expectations and thoughts were.", "Also, take a look at the location of the event. It should be where current and potential clients are and in regions that align with your overall business growth and opportunity. For example, if your startup doesn\u2019t operate and have any employees or immediate plans to launch in Europe, attending a conference in Amsterdam doesn\u2019t make much sense. However, if you are growing in APAC, review the core events happening in that region (this is an area where events are key to brand awareness and success), and ensure you divert budget for them.", "Once you decide to participate in a conference, you need to decide whether to attend or to sponsor.", "Attending an event is a must if you\u2019re looking to network, build your brand, or at the very least, learn something. For example, if the CEO is attending, make sure they can also meet with clients that are attending or potential clients the company is interested in. It\u2019s even better if there are speaking opportunities involved. Positioning your brand as a thought leader in the space should be one of your goals, and speaking in front of ", "different audiences helps you build that credibility", ".", "Learning is also one of the main reasons", " to attend a conference. You\u2019ll get the opportunity to hear from other industry experts about what is currently trending, possibly find inspiration for future speaking ideas, or simply determine if the event is worth attending in the future.", "On the other hand, if an event hits everything on your checklist \u2014 it has the right audience, it\u2019s the right price, and it offers the opportunity to have a bigger impact \u2014 sponsoring might be the best option for your startup. If you are seriously considering sponsoring, take into consideration what the sponsorship package offers and how you\u2019re going to execute.", "Not all sponsorship opportunities come with a speaking opportunity, but some do, which may be of particular interest. Speaking slots can fill up, so if the attendees at a respective conference are the exact people you want to get in front of and there\u2019s an opportunity to make a larger impact more strategically, then move forward and sponsor the event.", "A good alternative to sponsoring an event is to host a VIP dinner to ensure your brand meets with the exact people you\u2019re looking to get in front of. As you start planning, be sure to confirm how many of your staff members are needed to man the event and how many are actually free.", "Last but not least, don\u2019t forget to negotiate with the event organizers on possible discounts. The package price is often much higher than you actually have to pay. Just like you probably wouldn\u2019t pay the sticker price for a car, you shouldn\u2019t do so for an event sponsorship either.\u00a0 First, focus on getting the best price you can. Then turn to adding in some \u201cfreebies.\u201d For example, a sponsorship package may only include a limited number of passes, but you may need more, and it\u2019s worth asking. Additionally, you may be able to get a higher number of brand awareness opportunities, like adding your logo to water bottle labels or signs at a breakfast.", "And not all speaking slots are created equal \u2014 the last slot in the afternoon of an all-day conference (when many have already left), or one just before lunch (as lines at the buffet begin to form) are close to useless. So make sure the time you speak is one of the points you negotiate. For example, try to get late morning or early afternoon slots on the second day of a show.", "Once you set goals, you might find that popular events don\u2019t meet your criteria as you evaluate them. It\u2019s entirely okay to skip, regardless of how big and popular an event may be. However, if you do decide to attend or sponsor an event, make sure it\u2019s in front of the right audience and has the potential to deliver a high ROI.", "Katie Jansen", " is CMO of AppLovin."]}

That legitimately came from the emotion and\u00a0neuroscience perspective.\u201d", "Project Axon is a large-scale group game that involved 100 participants. The players were split into two groups and told that they were alien civilizations at war with one another. One player, dubbed the Ancient One, sat away from the others with a VR headset and made\u00a0decisions and passed judgment based only on the information the rest gave them via a mobile app.", "The Ancient One would only see the top four headlines on a kind of social media feed in their headset, which the rest of the players controlled indirectly by liking stories on their app. Most of the players were citizens, but a few got the role of \u201cmedia.\u201d These could see which headlines were accurate and which were false, and they could choose which ones to promote.", "Culyba says that couching it in a science-fiction context added more distance from the interaction so that the players could actually think about what they were doing and the way biases affect behavior. The social media-like interface connected their actions in the game back to how they might actually use real social media in their daily lives.", "\u201cOne of the big challenges with making something for impact\u2014whenever you\u2019re trying to change someone\u2019s mind or change their behavior, your goal isn\u2019t just that at the moment they read it, they think, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s a really good point,'\u201d said Culyba. \u201cYour goal is, a week later they\u2019re different.\u201d", "In addition to VR and the mobile app, Project Axon also took place in a physical space. Culyba said that itself led to a lot of design decisions to get players to behave in a certain way.", "\u201cOne of their goals was to get people to have conversations. They arranged the chairs in semicircles, so when people sat down they were naturally facing each other in a way that said, you are a small group,\u201d said Culyba. He added, \u201cThey have two different roles in the experience \u2014 citizens and media. They gave the media hats. Just the act of putting on a costume gets people to behave differently.\u201d", "Project Axon isn\u2019t available to download since the team built it to present only\u00a0at the festival. But it\u2019s a part of the larger conversation around \u201cfake news\u201d and particularly the way media can affect people\u2019s perspectives.

It didn\u2019t quite work like that, though.", "While some people did embrace the mashup of genres to create a small but dedicated fanbase, many reacted with confusion and even resentment. Despite our efforts to promote Drifting Lands first and foremost as an ARPG in all of our public-facing communications, the majority of people held it to the expectations of a classic shoot-\u2019em-up.\u00a0Stages without boss battles, the need to constantly upgrade weaponry, grinding for high-end gear, and RNG-based loot \u2014 these were some of the most widely criticized elements. What\u2019s interesting to note is how such facets of gameplay are also staples of our ARPG influences. So, players either missed our game description, or read it and still expected a classic shoot-\u2019em-up over an ARPG.", "It raises an interesting question: why is it that one genre mashup is accepted at face value and one is not? Are shmups simply too rooted in tradition? Did we push too far, or not far enough? Trying to please everyone is a quick route to making a bland game, and, in our case, a lot of feedback from early players was diametrically opposed due to the differences in genres. As a designer, the alchemy needed to balance your vision with players\u2019 expectations in such a scenario is both delicate and mysterious.", "Drifting Lands is not a perfect game, and certainly there were changes we would loved to have made with the benefit of a larger budget and more time. That said, I\u2019m quite proud of what we achieved as a six-person team. On the whole, the game works as intended and we have players spending more than 50 hours in the game.", "Economically though, Drifting Lands was a far more dangerous project than I had imagined. Was it avoidable? Almost certainly. With more research, perhaps we would have learned that some traditions aren\u2019t to be meddled with, or how to better introduce players to a new spin on an old idea. The difficulty is in getting to the heart of that information.", "For example, prototyping is an invaluable tool for gauging an idea\u2019s feasibility early in development. That said, there is a huge difference between prototyping something like a linear FPS, versus a system-heavy ARPG like Drifting Lands.

Being able to touch things and smell things \u2014 between the haptics and the other 4D effects we add to our experiences, that\u2019s what creates that true immersion, as well as the social aspect.

How do you show an audience something they haven\u2019t seen before? It\u2019s no different with what we\u2019re doing at The Void.

People still go to amusement parks because you can\u2019t replicate any of that at home. Some of the things that we\u2019re doing, even though we don\u2019t have a very big footprint, are still more than you can do at home, especially that social experience that we try to create.", "But there are things we\u2019re doing to create an in-home experience that may prepare you for going to a Void center, or allow you to network in. We\u2019re working on technology where we can have people in different physical locations still share the same virtual worlds. That will give us some flexibility, not just at our Void centers, but for people who can engage from home.", "GamesBeat: A lot of those connections seem to be in the works.

The company raised $10.3 million in 2015 from Comcast Ventures, Tencent, Dolby Family Ventures, Raine Ventures, Lux Capital, Western Technology Investments, Maven Ventures, Promus Ventures, Streamlined Ventures, and Rothenberg Ventures.", "Romo said in an interview with GamesBeat in April that AltspaceVR was hoping to monetize events that companies paid for, not unlike\u00a0the way Linden Lab monetized corporations in its Second Life virtual world. But AltspaceVR\u2019s traffic was relatively small, at about 35,000 users a month. That\u2019s a sign of how small the overall base for VR is and it probably tells you why the company ran out of funds, as that number isn\u2019t enough to get investors excited.", "It\u2019s not clear exactly what this means for other VR startups, but everybody knows that growth is slower than expected.

AltSpace and Linden Lab\u2019s\u00a0Sansar, for example, have spent a lot of time building out a really robust infrastructure platform and are largely relying on other developers to create fun experiences built atop their platform. Rec Room and Star Trek, on the other hand, have focused more on providing a compelling, engaging experience off the bat for users, which in turn has the potential to build a strong social community. Given the user numbers and slower adoption curve, as an investor I prefer the latter strategy.\u201d", "Above: AltspaceVR comedy night.", "He added, \u201cIn terms of what it means for venture-backed VR companies, I think it\u2019s probably a reality check in a somewhat frothy market. I think Eric and his team are fantastic and trust they\u2019ll find their way.\u201d", "And Tipatat Chennavasin, cofounder of the Venture Reality Fund, said in an email, \u201cWhen a shutdown happens, it\u2019s hard to understand without knowing all the details. AltspaceVR, led by Eric Romo, was a true pioneer and did some ground-breaking work in VR and social. It\u2019s a shame they weren\u2019t able to get further funds to continue to innovate \u2014 the news also comes right after Within announcing a $40 million round, indicating evolving investor dynamics in the sector.\u201d", "Chennavasin added: \u201cFor later venture rounds, the bar is raised higher and tangible metrics really come into play. A lot of times the main challenge for early innovators is to manage the company\u2019s growth in a nascent but potentially explosive market where there are no established investment patterns and the venture investors are still discovering the subtleties of the sector. Altspace has opened many doors of creativity and teased us all with compelling possibilities in social VR. I\u2019m afraid their timing wasn\u2019t precisely aligned with investor sentiments, especially in later rounds where certain growth parameters are expected, which is hard to do in early stages of the VR market with a small installed base.\u00a0One last thing I will add is that the team were not just pioneers but also great supporters of the larger VR development community and will be missed. They have definitely learned a lot on their journey and I look forward to seeing what they do next.\u201d", "Andrew Wilson, CEO of Electronic Arts, also said on Thursday", " that it may be a couple of years\u2019 wait for the mass VR market.", "Jason Rubin, head of studios at Oculus VR, said in an interview last week that he isn\u2019t surprised big companies like EA and Activision Blizzard haven\u2019t jumped into VR yet. He sees smaller companies moving into VR that they will stake out the opportunities first. Once that happens, the big companies, like EA, will likely acquire those that have the lead.", "Regarding Wilson\u2019s comments, Mahajan said, \u201cI don\u2019t disagree with him. The consumer VR market is going to take a while to develop still. I think new Daydream phones and Apple\u2019s (rumored) addition of an OLED screen to the iPhone 8 will help drive adoption of mass market consumer VR. But we\u2019re at least one phone refresh cycle away (18 to 24 months) from everyone having VR available to them.\u201d", "Stephanie Llamas, analyst at SuperData Research, said, \u201cI think the closure was an example of how good companies suffer from the prematurely inflated expectations for the industry as a whole that many companies had early on. Primarily, investors are now spooked because there was an overvaluation of the market. Now that growth isn\u2019t going as fast as they\u2019d expected, they reevaluated their risk and are now undervaluing certain opportunities. AltspaceVR was truly a pioneer in the social VR space. It should not have been discounted, and I honestly think this is a tragedy for the industry.\u201d", "Bjorn Laurin, vice president of product at Linden Lab, said he too was sorry to see the sad outcome for AltspaceVR.

I was building great games for workforce development, training, and learning.", "We started off by going to large companies in Pittsburgh, like Alcoa and Westinghouse and US Steel.

Bunchball in particular, I went out to see their CEO. I think internally we did not consider ourselves part of that, because when we started, earlier on, out of Carnegie Mellon, we were really focused on solving real problems with games that were using the concept of simulation to train. How could you do a better, faster, cheaper flight simulation, but for all these other occupations? Not so much adding incentives and rewards around a structure that was already there, like sales.", "We also acknowledge that as part of a larger wave in the market, though, for people to understand \u2014 people would say, \u201cOh, you\u2019re a gamification company?\u201d And we\u2019d say, \u201cOkay, sure.\u201d The reason we changed the name of the company \u2014 there were a couple of reasons, but the reason we finally changed it to Simcoach Games was because we were using game design as a differentiator from passive learning to active learning.

They\u2019re not as deep. They\u2019re not around compliance training, so it\u2019s not truly game-based simulation.

And when they are filled there\u2019s too much turnover. How can we balance that out? There are always people out of work who don\u2019t know what they want to do. Maybe one subset of that goes on to a four-year college, but really shouldn\u2019t. Those are the kinds of things we\u2019re looking at.

Getting people aware about what their path might be from training to a career, and some of the skills. Do you have an aptitude or a proclivity toward those skills? A big one, huge, is construction. There are 20-plus different trades, and in this country primarily \u2014 if your dad wasn\u2019t a carpenter you don\u2019t think about being a carpenter, let alone other trades.

Those are the ones that we\u2019re generally focused on, because we have those needs here, and then we\u2019re building out across the country. Also retail, retail grocery, and technology. How do you find a high-school dropout or someone from a low-income, disadvantaged environment that might have the wiring to do a technical job, but has never been encouraged in that way and doesn\u2019t really know? Can you use games to get their attention and have them solve puzzles, like in an entertainment game? Then you feel out at the end that they have that proclivity and ramp them into a training program. Those are the kinds of jobs we\u2019re looking at right now, but I know we can use games in different areas beyond that.", "GamesBeat: So the game is meant to give you an idea of what the job is like, visually?", "Trybus:", " There are maybe three, four, five categories of games that we\u2019re building today. One might be career awareness in general. One might be life skills, soft skills. We hear this from employers \u2014 a lot of folks don\u2019t know it\u2019s important to show up on time, to plan time management. How to interact with other people. Basic stuff to be successful at a job that has nothing to do with the skills of a job. Also, the aptitude assessment, the types of games I mentioned for things like tech aptitude, as well as maybe safety skills, particular skills for a particular occupation.", "The idea is, can you play all this so that when you\u2019re recruited, or you want to go into a training program, so you have an idea of what you\u2019re going into? You play a crane game to be attracted to being an operating engineer. It doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re certified to operate a crane, but it means you know what it\u2019s like to operate a crane. You understand the physics, the controls, the safety and variables that play into it, how much money you can make, and all in a fun way.", "GamesBeat: Can you make the game really fun and let you knock a bunch of buildings down?", "Trybus:", " Sure you can. That\u2019s a big part of what we learned from the day we started the company. We want to give them a taste, but we want to make the game in and of itself fun and motivate them to find out more. Or maybe you\u2019re motivated to not find out more. You talk about\u2014I don\u2019t want to work at heights on a tower crane. I don\u2019t want to work in a lot of snow here.

The games are free. That\u2019s the model. Schools, from middle schools to high schools to tech schools, are interested in using these to reinforce their curriculum and their messaging. The schools, at least in Pennsylvania, have to create opportunities for career awareness and career exploration. That\u2019s built into our law. How they do that is a bit broader, but these games are starting to fit in \u2013 both the soft skills games I mentioned and the career-specific ones.", "GamesBeat: How do you make money? Is it on a project basis with companies?", "Trybus:", " Traditionally we\u2019ve taken on games with development partners that know the problem we\u2019re solving, know the content. They\u2019ve paid for the games to be developed. Our core focus, our core model, is the licensing of a data dashboard to a training organization or industry association or an employer.", "I mentioned that crane game. If you\u2019re looking to recruit operating engineers, you might pick out five of the games we have that are applicatble to your trade. Essentially, that organization would pay for data per game, per zip code, to see who in that zip code has played these games, has done well, and expressed more interest. That\u2019s the connection. The games have, and will have, a direct \u2014 they\u2019ll be localized. If you\u2019re interested, it\u2019ll you send you to a local organization that provides training or an onramp to find out about getting into those careers. That\u2019ll be different here than it is in, say, northern California. We call it regional target messaging. The clients pay on a software service model.", "GamesBeat: It\u2019s like using mobile game analytics and user acquisition for job recruits.", "Trybus:", " Right. All of our games are free. The idea is, if you play these games, you sign up and create a digital profile in our \u2014 the thing is called the Simcoach Skill Arcade. It\u2019s the games, the digital profile, and the data dashboard. You acknowledge that if you play these games, you\u2019re going to accrue badges, achievements, and that data can be shared with potential employers.

Exposing them to careers that are available without getting too into the weeds on when they have to start training. But that\u2019s when they say it\u2019s important to start this exposure, in middle school, so they can think through it over the next couple of years.", "GamesBeat: How were you inspired to create the company in the beginning?", "Trybus:", " Personally, I was working on the question of whether we could build games for training. I was doing that at the ETC. I thought, \u201cWell, instead of going back out west to create games, I\u2019ll go to industry and start to learn about their needs.\u201d I think it just started itself really fast, because back then \u2014 2004, when I started to talk to companies \u2013 I was surprised by how much they thought this made sense, even when I was talking about special graphics cards and high-powered computers to run the games. We weren\u2019t running 3D games in browsers in 2005.", "Above: Simcoach\u2019s Selector Safety shows you how to operate safely in construction areas.", "GamesBeat: Is that what some companies wanted? The equivalent of Uncharted 4?", "Trybus:", " Yeah, but we work through that. The budgets were \u2014 we were building games for a couple hundred thousand dollars, or a couple million. Now that cost is much lower, but of course we\u2019re making a much shorter game that focuses on specific critical skills. We have a pretty tried and true process that\u2019s evolved, a method for creating these, how we do them and how we integrate the content experts. But yeah, I think up front \u2014 we had to focus on, what\u2019s the learning objective? How does this feature or that feature benefit the learning, as opposed to just being cool?", "GamesBeat: Your company seems to fit here more than it would in, say, Hollywood.", "Trybus:", " For sure. I really think it\u2019s a great Pittsburgh story, because of Pittsburgh\u2019s history. It feels like Pittsburgh to be applying the techniques and technologies of game design and development to solve industry problems. Especially for a lot of the industries here. We\u2019re excited about where it\u2019s evolved to and where we\u2019re going.", "GamesBeat: What does your client list look like? Is it spread around the country, or is it concentrated here?", "Trybus:", " A lot of our clients have always been national, and even international, because our games apply to industries regardless of whether you\u2019re making steel or ketchup. We\u2019ve worked with companies all over the world, or at least that have a global presence.", "Right now we are focused on the regional targeted messaging in a big way in Pennsylvania. That\u2019s primarily as we\u2019re building out the platform, building out the games, and building out the state partners, as well as the local partners and companies we\u2019re working with. We\u2019re targeting a lot of our skillers to be from this region. That said, we\u2019re already inadvertently pulling in a lot of interest from other parts of the country. Southern California is one area. It\u2019s because the story of construction around the country is the same. The story of nursing shortages is the same. The story of soft skills is the same. But as far as proving it out, we\u2019re focused here.", "GamesBeat: It seems like a lot of people in the game-centric areas might not chase after that. They wouldn\u2019t spot this kind of opportunity. When you teach about this subject at the ETC, do you talk about it in a different way with students?", "Trybus:", " The ETC is primarily project-based. My title actually has \u201cProfessor of Practice\u201d in it. The idea is, I\u2019m in industry making a lot of games with a lot of different clients, focusing on the problem we\u2019re solving. I bring that back in and focus on process with the students. I try my best to ask questions that they can think about and explore, but at the end of the day the students will work on interdisciplinary teams, which is a big deal. They\u2019ll have a client and they\u2019ll go through the process of concepting, prototyping, playtesting, iteration, publishing to the app stores\u2014it\u2019s a soup to nuts experience in 16 weeks, with a real client.", "I bring what I see as best practices, I hope, back in. But it\u2019s similar. It\u2019s very similar to what we do here. It\u2019s just that these teams have 12 years of experience through many iterations.", "GamesBeat: Is the ETC graduating anyone with this kind of specialization, like training simulation?", "Trybus:", " There\u2019s certainly a specialty \u2014 I think Jesse tried to coin the term \u201ctransformational games.\u201d There\u2019s a specialty in looking at games for other than entertainment purposes. But the fact of the matter is, nine out of 10 projects we did 10 years ago or more were straight entertainment, whether it was theme parks or 3D/4D movies or console games. Today, arguably, nine out of 10 projects at the ETC are edutainment, or something that is about a way to effectively communicate, whether it\u2019s theme park or game design. So to answer your question, yes, there are people who are very interested in pursuing things like serious games or transformational games, educational games for kids, but it\u2019s naturally leaning toward that anyway.", "Above: Simcoach Games creates simulations of real-life jobs.", "GamesBeat: Since there is that broader category of serious games, is there competition in the field of what you\u2019re doing?", "Trybus:", " Our competition over the years has primarily been the traditional passive training solutions that were in companies. Now it\u2019s the recruiting, the job boards, anything that has to do with workforce development and training. That\u2019s our major competition. A lot of studios have come and gone or stayed around the country and around the world doing one-off projects using games for learning. That\u2019s all over the place.

Is that in the same space?", "Trybus:", " We\u2019ve had some crossover in the past, especially early on. If I remember correctly, they came out of the Department of Defense side of it. Early on, our competitors were mainly funded by Defense or came out of that kind of work.", "GamesBeat: Military training?", "Trybus:", " Right, or health care, but with government funding either way. I don\u2019t know of other companies that have been around as long as we have that started by going straight for industry.

I\u2019m not sure if anybody really measures that.", "Trybus:", " At the time the government was huge, but the market to use this kind of technology to solve industry problems has certainly grown, and is growing. Especially now that we have the proliferation of mobile devices. It\u2019s all in the cloud. It\u2019s all trackable. That didn\u2019t exist 10 years ago.", "GamesBeat: It sounds like it was a big boiling-the-ocean test to get it started.", "Trybus:", " You\u2019re right. Looking back, I agree with you. One of our challenges has always been the potential to lose focus, because we get a lot of people calling and saying, \u201cHey, can you build me a game for X-Y-Z?\u201d And we have, especially when we bootstrapped the company to get to our core solution, which is the Simcoach Skill Arcade. We built a lot of great games that won\u2019t fit into the Skill Arcade, but that\u2019s what balanced the business and taught us how to build great games.", "GamesBeat: You would favor creating something that fits in the Arcade over something that\u2019s just a one-off?", "Trybus:", " Yeah, because we\u2019re focused on a scale solution. We want to collect the data around career readiness so we can license it, because we think that information and the skillers that are signing up will be really valuable to these industries or potential employers.

Early on our games were focused on corporate training, often around safety. To be able to build a video game that we could reasonably say saved lives \u2014 that was pretty cool. Now we\u2019re building video games that have changed lives, in the sense of bringing people from underserved populations into places where they have career opportunities. That\u2019s the core thing.", "The other piece of it, to me, is just getting to learn new things and interact with lots of different people, and then the challenge of translating all of that into games.", "GamesBeat: I\u2019m most familiar with entertainment games, but what makes a good training program?", "Myers:", " The overlap, if you do it right, is really quite large. I subscribe to Raph Koster\u2019s notion that fun is what we experience when our brains are learning. If we build our games right, we end up with a fun game that also happens to be \u2014 the core learning happens to be about whatever the topic is. Things that are key to that are the same things that are key to good games: challenge, meaningful interaction, well-defined goals, things like that. You see all those things together in both entertainment games and educational games. In an educational game it all comes around learning objectives that are specified up front.", "GamesBeat: What do you think has been your most impactful game, out of all 150 or so?", "Myers:", " Honestly, maybe it\u2019s because I was just in a meeting talking about it, but one of our more recent games is called Booeys. It\u2019s a game intended to serve as a pathway into tech-related careers, STEM-related careers. It\u2019s a little puzzle game where you essentially program a little ghost to achieve little objectives. It encourages you as you go along. If you\u2019re succeeding, the ghost character comes up and tells you nice things and eventually encourages you to reach out to resources where you can potentially get training toward a tech career.", "The numbers right now are pretty small, but we have a concrete pipeline from downloading the game to playing the game to reaching out for resources to actually ending up in tech skills boot camps. We have people who\u2019ve gone through that entire pipeline and who are either in a boot camp now or moving into careers that were otherwise not open to them. We\u2019re working on increasing the numbers now, but to me that\u2019s such a tangible story of impacting someone\u2019s life.", "Trybus:", " We also have evidence \u2014 the numbers are in the dozens only, but evidence of the success of the game lining up with the success of the boot camp program that sets you up for being successful in a job. That\u2019s pretty significant so far.", "Above: Carnegie Mellon\u2019s soccer field.", "GamesBeat: It seems like it\u2019s hard to measure in some ways. Sometimes a person might wind up in a career years from now, but they were exposed through your games.", "Myers:", " Right. They may be predisposed. I don\u2019t necessarily see that as a knock, other than we\u2019re providing another avenue for those people. Another big game \u2014 we built version one a couple of years ago, and we\u2019re building a more modern version now \u2014 is a game called Future Road Builders that\u2019s intended to help people decide if they\u2019re interested in a career in construction, and then choose a trade within construction.", "What\u2019s interesting about that one is that it\u2019s another game designed as a pathway into a career. But in that case, pre-qualifying people is a part of it. We\u2019re happy with someone playing it and deciding they never want to go into construction, because you don\u2019t want to waste everyone\u2019s time if you apply to an apprenticeship, get in, and halfway through your first year you realize you don\u2019t like it. On the other hand, if you go through that and decide you do want to work in construction, ending up in the right trade is the next important choice. If we can help people make that choice, that serves a purpose that makes me feel good.", "Trybus:", " I think, in addition \u2014 there\u2019s a lot of different games that I think have had really positive impact for different reasons. We talked about the history of safety. Even related to what we\u2019re building now for some of the trades \u2014 when you go down a negative path and talk about knocking stuff over and you see your character blow up or fall or whatever, it\u2019s really because of your choices, or lack of choices, the right choices. Those kinds of things have been impactful as far as taking that seriously and pursuing that further.", "GamesBeat: How are you recruiting people into the company? Is there a particular pitch that\u2019s successful at attracting people as employees?", "Myers:", " We have really strong ties to the ETC at CMU. That\u2019s a huge recruiting pipeline. The Art Institute, locally, is another source of artists \u2014 both people coming out and folks who are further down the line of their career. On the business side we have other avenues, typically through school communities or programs that arise around education. That\u2019s a big one. The development community \u2014 in terms of games, but also tech in general \u2014 is just exploding around here. There\u2019s more and more talent available. There\u2019s a lot of competition for jobs.", "GamesBeat: When you launch a game, are you the ones doing the best job of drawing the audience, or do the companies you work with serve that purpose? Do they advertise or otherwise pull people into the game?", "Trybus:", " We\u2019ve been talking about the best ways to do that. It\u2019s probably the combination of a bunch of things. Typically we\u2019re trying to work with our development partners and content partners to get it out. We have some other ideas on how to cross-promote. I talked with someone who might be developing a game with a specific audience, but if they put that game on our platform that has all the Skill Arcade users, they\u2019re essentially able to get cross-promotion from other games. You can see that network growing and working to help others. But right now it\u2019s fair to say that we\u2019re leaning on the industries and development partners we work with, building up from there as far as how to promote our games.", "Above: Simcoach Games works with Pennsylvania\u2019s state government on games that simulate roadside construction jobs.", "GamesBeat: I can see a health care company advertising this on TV, something like that.", "Myers:", " Future Road Builders is a great example. Our organizational partner, the Constructors Association of Western Pennsylvania, literally puts futureroadbuilders.com on all of their materials. They\u2019ve convinced their trade union partners to do the same thing. Whenever we go visit one of the apprenticeship centers, something like that, they always have flyers out.

According to Pitchbook\u2019s latest analysis, Limited Partners (LPs) remain committed to the asset class with 87 percent of VC funds hitting their targets, tracking 2017 as the ninth consecutive year the percentage of funds to hit their target has increased. On the deal front, value has increased 53 percent since 4Q 2016 as VCs focus on a high number of mega-financings and pull back on the angel and seed stage. The exit market is also on the mend following a dismal 2016, with five VC-backed unicorn IPO exits, pacing 2017 as having the most unicorn exits ever.", "On the heels of a record fundraising year in 2016 ($41 billion), LPs continue to show strong interest in the asset class, with 58 VC funds raised in Q2 contributing an additional $11.4 billion of dry powder. This quarter there were several groundbreaking funds raised, most notably New Enterprise Associates 16, which raised a $3.3 billion fund, making it the largest VC fund raised to date. Additionally, first-time fund managers hit the ground running in the first half of this year with $1.5 billion raised across 15 funds \u2013 the highest level of first-time fundraising activity in the past decade. The increased interest in first-time fund managers is likely attributed to their hyper-focus on specific niche markets attracting investor interest (for example, financial services-focused Centana Growth Partners and real estate-minded Fifth Wall Ventures). Coupled with its characteristic smaller vehicles and attainable targets, first-time fund managers have been well-received by LPs in Q2.", "In the second quarter, deal count and value increased considerably with $21.78 billion deployed across 1,958 companies, up from $15.9 billion invested in 1,954 companies in Q1 2017. What differentiates Q2 from earlier quarters is deal size \u2013 Q2 saw 34 transactions of at least $100 million in value, up from just 12 transactions in Q1. Thus far, 2017 is pacing to have the largest number of rounds of at least $50 million in the last decade. The strong fundraising environment has allowed VCs to pump more capital into later stages companies looking to continue growing and scaling before considering an exit. In fact, the top 10 deals of the quarter accounted for $4.3 billion, representing nearly 20 percent of all dollars invested in Q2.", "Meanwhile, the number of completed angel and seed transactions has now declined for eight consecutive quarters. What\u2019s more, first-time financings are being completed at the lowest proportion of any year, compared to the number of overall deals. Just 29 percent of completed financings in 2017 have been first-time funding rounds. The primary reason for the decline in these stages is a fundamental change in how startups are fundraising early on. For instance, the prevalence of incubators and accelerators has helped early stage startups refine their business model and secure capital at the outset, delaying the need to seek out traditional VC. Additionally, it\u2019s never been cheaper to start a business thanks to advancements in technology \u2013 companies can now operate on a smaller amount of capital for longer periods of time, further reducing the urgency for angel and seed financing.", "On the heels of one of the slowest years on record for all VC-backed IPOs in 2016, the first half of 2017\u00a0 has already experienced historic IPO activity. Only halfway through the year, we\u2019ve already seen five unicorn IPOs (MuleSoft, Snap, Okta, Cloudera, and Blue Apron), with another on deck (FourScout). So 2017 is on pace to hold the record for most unicorn IPOs, beating out 2015 with seven. But this uptick in unicorn public debuts has been a long time in the making. As companies take longer to work through each stage of financing, lifecycles have extended, allowing more time to gradually increase valuations. At last count, the average time to exit stood at roughly six years, up from less than five years a decade ago.", "Overall, exit activity continues to slide, with $10.5 billion in exit value across 156 transactions in Q2, down from $17.2 billion in value via 211 exits this same period last year. While the lack of exits can be troublesome for VCs, the market is adapting to a new norm characterized by outsized exits. The four largest exits so far in 2017 have accounted for 48 percent of the total exit value. Furthermore, startups acquired so far this year have secured a median exit post-valuation of $160.5 million, which exceeds peak levels in 2014 at $120 million. These outsized exits are attracting private equity investors. This quarter\u2019s report shows an increase in private equity buyouts as another exit route, accounting for 19 percent of exits so far in 2017, compared to 13 percent in 2016.", "The trend of companies staying private longer raises questions over the efficiency with which capital is being deployed, but VCs are determined to adjust to this dynamic and keep the venture ecosystem healthy. And their efforts are already paying off. Despite potentially delayed returns, LPs continue to show confidence in the asset class and VC\u2019s ability to create and realize value at a reasonable pace. There will continue to be lingering question marks in the new environment of mega funds and unicorns, but for now, VCs are successfully adapting.", "Nizar Tarhuni", " is Analyst Manager at ", "PitchBook", "."]}

Now, however, the time for iterative improvements are done. It\u2019s time for Destiny 2, and ahead of its September 6 launch on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One (a PC version follows October 24), I spent some time playing the closed beta on Xbox One. This test provides access to the opening story mission, a three-player cooperative Strike, and the team-based multiplayer.", "Was it enough to get me excited for the sequel? Eh.", "Above: Destiny 2 begins with the destruction of everything players fought to protect in Destiny 1.", "Let\u2019s start with that story mission, which succeeded in actually telling a story (something the first Destiny often struggled with). It quickly set up the premise of the sequel \u2014 bad guys blow up your home and take away your powers \u2014 while reintroducing characters and bringing in new ones. It was also kind of fun (and a little sad) to see the main hub from the first Destiny surrounded in chaos and fire.", "It also managed to introduce some fun elements and switch-ups. Missions in Destiny often only involved walking in a straight line and shooting things, with sequences of waiting for a door to open while fighting off waves of baddies being the only thing breaking up the monotony (although those sections became quickly\u00a0monotonous themselves). So it was nice to actually see a couple platforming sections in the mission, including one that had me running through a turbine.", "It was a flashy and exciting start for Destiny 2. If the rest of the game can maintain that level of quality, it\u2019ll be a solid campaign.", "But playing this mission also validated some fears I had going in. Destiny 2 does not feel very different from the first Destiny. And in a way, I get that. The mechanics and interface in the first game were never an issue. The shooting always felt satisfying and the menus were easy to navigate.", "Above: I don\u2019t like my new staff.", "But even beyond that stuff, it\u2019s kind of disappointing how little as changed. You can still only pick between one of three of classes: Hunter, Warlock, or Titan. I went with Hunter, as that\u2019s what I played in the first Destiny. And it felt almost exactly the same. Even the stuff that was new, like a new staff-based super move, didn\u2019t feel very fresh. The staff, which basically lets you use a bunch of powerful melee and short-distance projectile attacks, behaved almost identically to the Hunter\u2019s old Bladedancer shtick.", "Each class also has a new class ability that helps give them more of a role in group play. Warlocks can put down a healing circle. Titans can raise a barrier to protect allies. Hunters, meanwhile, can do a dodge roll. It\u2019s not nearly as flashy \u2026 or as useful.", "Maybe I just got unlucky by picking a Hunter. Maybe that barrel roll is actually more useful than I understand. But it feels like my class got a bit screwed. I\u2019m basically playing exactly the same as I did before, except I can do a dumb roll every minute or so. If they aren\u2019t going to add new classes, I wish they at least did more to make the old ones feel different.", "I\u2019m also not a big fan of the new weapon class system. In the first Destiny, you had primary, special, and heavy weapons. You could equip one of each. Primary guns were more standard things like pistols or automatic rifles, special guns were more situational tools like sniper rifles and shotguns, and heavy weapons were unique, powerful items like rocket launchers and swords.", "In Destiny 2, you instead have kinetic, energy, and power weapons. Kinetic and energy weapons both use the same guns that were in the standard category in the first Destiny. They just use different ammo and are more effective against different kinds of enemies. Power weapons combines the special and heavy categories. This makes it impossible to equip a sniper rifle and a rocket launcher at the same time. Also, since power ammo is the hardest to come by, you won\u2019t be able to use your shotgun or sniper rifle nearly as often as you did in the first Destiny. It makes me feel less versatile.", "Above: A cooperative Strike.", "I enjoyed the new Strike. I was happy to see that the boss actually had mechanics and wasn\u2019t just a bullet sponge, like most bosses in the first Destiny\u2019s Strikes. I was less thrilled with the competitive multiplayer. It felt like the same sort of thing I had grown tired of in console shooters for years, plus it was hard for me to get used to aiming on a controller after I\u2019ve been spending so much time on Overwatch on the PC.", "Maybe I\u2019ll enjoy Destiny 2\u2019s multiplayer more when I can play it on a PC too, but I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s just so familiar. It\u2019s the same kind of generic shooter mutliplayer we\u2019ve seen on console games since Halo popularized the idea.", "Above: Let\u2019s go, team.", "So, yeah, I don\u2019t know. Destiny 2 seems fine. I\u2019m not crazy about some of the changes, and Hunters seem weak compared to the other classes, but content in the beta is high-quality. The story mission is interesting, and the Strike is a great challenge for a small group of friends. Multiplayer didn\u2019t grab me, but maybe I\u2019ll enjoy it more when I can try out more modes in the full game.", "But it\u2019s hard to gather much excitement about Destiny 2 from the beta. Part of the problem is that I can\u2019t try out a lot the new things that I want to see. I\u2019m curious if Destiny 2\u2019s open environments will feel more interesting with its new quest systems, but the beta doesn\u2019t let you do any exploring. You just play the story mission and then use a menu to pick the Strike or the competitive multiplayer.", "It\u2019s also weird to play a role-playing game like Destiny 2 without any character progression or loot drops.

Since the passage of regulations allowing companies to source funding from Main Street American investors, startups have been flocking to crowdfunding platforms to secure capital. But what makes a crowdfunding campaign successful? The most obvious answer is a large social following \u2014 a crowd of loyal fans that would invest their hard-earned cash in a seemingly great idea. We expected this to be the case, and we analyzed the social media followings of 233 campaigns to find evidence. But while our hypothesis holds some truth, social media may not be as important to crowdfunding success as we initially believed.", "According to the crowdfunding law, a company must have a deadline date for reaching its minimum funding target (MFT). The offering is considered closed and not open for further investments after the deadline date is reached. If a company hits its MFT on or before the deadline, it is considered funded. We analyzed all closed campaigns, whether they were funded or not. Of the 233 campaigns, 120 reached their MFT, while 113 were not funded. Our analysis looked at the Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram networks of both groups separately then together. We also considered the LinkedIn accounts of the CEOs to see if a correlation exists between the number of professional connections and the company\u2019s ability to secure funding. A surprisingly anticlimactic trend emerged: Overall, while social media appears to play a positive role in a campaign\u2019s funding, this is only true to a minor extent. The chart below shows the trend line between the funds a company raised and its social following. The trend line shows that while there is a positive correlation between size of social following and raised funds, it holds little significance.", "This doesn\u2019t mean social media is a waste of time. In fact, the importance of a social following appears to vary by industry, as shown in chart below with trendlines for different industries. For industries where a social following plays a pivotal role, such as wine and spirits or apparel, the trend is more dramatic than for other industries. The wine and spirits industry appears to maximize the power of a smaller social network. This may be because wine and spirits tends to have a following of loyal fans, particularly when looking at local brands that have a storefront presence. However, for industries that have a technical background and lower social reach, such as transportation and consumer goods, the trend is almost flat or even reversed. The key here is to understand whether your industry is one that attracts followers; if so, you may be able to leverage them for crowdfunding success. If your industry is one that doesn\u2019t attract a crowd, don\u2019t rely on your social following to fund your campaign.", "To date, California and Texas have had the most crowdfunded campaigns. With that in mind, we assessed the importance of a social media following in both states. Our data suggests that a large social network is much more important in California than Texas, as shown below. This may be due to Silicon Valley\u2019s influence in the region. Since there is more competition for venture capital, perhaps companies are leveraging crowdfunding and their social networks to signal popularity and a reason to invest. In Texas, a social following is not a determinant of campaign success. This could be due to a more direct financial approach to crowdfunding in Texas, where investors are searching for proven financial strength instead of social exposure. The implication for startups is that you should understand who you are targeting with your campaign and focus your social media outreach on that. A deeper analysis of other states is in order, but there simply is not enough activity in other states to make a judgement.", "We came across one of the most telling findings when we compared the top 20 campaigns, all of which raised above $500,000, to those that raised precisely zero. The top 20 campaigns had a clear advantage in social media following. On every platform, the top 20 campaigns far exceeded the non-starters in number of followers. It seems almost as if the campaigns that raised no money were intentionally avoiding social media. The chart below displays the total social following for the top 20 and the nonfunded campaigns and suggests that social media plays an essential role on each side of the spectrum. If you want to raise $1,070,000, the most that is permitted by law, you should focus some resources on building a fan base. Beyond these three networks is the LinkedIn following for the CEOs of each startup. As expected the LinkedIn following for the top 20 far exceeded that of the bottom campaigns. On average, the nonfunded campaign CEOs had 32 connections on LinkedIn, while the top 20 CEO\u2019s had 414 connections. This discrepancy suggests that a CEO\u2019s professional network plays a vital role in the start-ups success on crowdfunding platforms.", "Our data included information for four major social media platforms: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn, in order of importance. Each social platform has its own benefits, but the one that stands out in crowdfunding is Facebook. It is almost as if Facebook is the center of a successful campaign. So at a minimum, make sure you have a Facebook presence.", "All things considered, the data suggests that the more money a company hopes to raise, the more it should focus on developing a social platform. But results vary by type of industry as well as the type of investor a company hopes to attract. However, companies hoping to raise less than $100,000 may not need to invest as much time on social media and could just use crowdfunding as a tool to speed up funding from pre-existing relationships. Nonetheless, some sort of following is essential, as the campaigns that raised no money demonstrate.", " Sherwood Neiss is a partner at ", "Crowdfund Capital Advisors", ".

I think those are two good words. The problem with publishers \u2014 I don\u2019t mind publishers, but if you take their money and follow their whims, in the end it\u2019s a group of people who need to decide and agree on the best direction for the game, and they all have aspirations in different directions. They all think they know how the public will react.", "In the end, that ruins a lot of games. If you talk to anyone who takes a project to a publisher early, it gets ruined. There\u2019s a board of people, all with their opinions \u2014 it\u2019s not really a problem with publishers specifically, but with any group of people. You could take any group here and ask them what we should do with this game, and they\u2019d all suggest different directions. I gave an example in there, where we asked for suggestions about Limbo. One guy suggested it should be in color. One guy suggested networking, doing a multiplayer game. All of them had their own thing. The guy who suggested multiplayer is into multiplayer games. The guy who suggested color, I don\u2019t know why he wanted that. But his reasoning was, \u201cI think the public would like to see this in color.\u201d", "Protecting good IP is important. It\u2019s one of the big problems people face when they go out to get money early in a project. If you\u2019re a seasoned developer, maybe, you know this is important, but if you don\u2019t have two or three games under your belt yet you may not know how important it is.

It\u2019s always good to do budgets, but it\u2019s also good to revise them, because it will change a lot in the beginning.

And also, in a sense, the accessibility in the game. It\u2019s not straying too far into a hardcore area. I definitely want it to give an experience\u2014to not cut people off mechanically. Inside does that very well. Most people can play Inside and not feel frustrated that they can\u2019t do what they want. But when it comes to the content, themes, art style, it\u2019s very different. The overriding mechanic on top of the basics of a platformer is very different as well.", "Patti:", " A lot of things about this, for me personally, make it more refreshing.

You work with us, we work with you, and everyone tries to make it work. If it doesn\u2019t work we split up. At Playdead we\u2019d maybe hire 60 people and lay off 30? It\u2019s not that they weren\u2019t talented people. They just didn\u2019t fit the culture. You can\u2019t do that as easily if people are abroad. We only hired locally at Playdead. Almost everyone was local. A few of the freelancers we worked with were abroad. It\u2019s nice to be able to find the best people in the world.

Amber CEO Steven Nelemans made the announcement at the Hannover Messe, one of the world\u2019s biggest industrial fairs, in April. It\u2019s a bold plan indeed, but the influential automotive consultancy firm Roland Berger recently ranked The Netherlands number one in its ", "Automotive Disruption Radar", ". So why not?", "Amber started as a student team at the ", "Eindhoven University of Technology", " (TU/e). [Disclosure: I work at the university as commercial director and invested \u20ac1000 in the team\u2019s crowdfunding campaign back in January.] The university is known for its advanced automotive courses and ambitious student teams. Apart from Amber, other spinoffs include a company working on a new way of energy storage for heavy transport using formic acid and one building a commercial car charged with solar power. Cooperations between the TU/e and automotive companies in the Brainport region of Eindhoven provide a fertile ecosystem for ambitious tech startups.", "While I didn\u2019t mentor the Amber team directly \u2014 either at the university or later at the HighTechXL accelerator in Eindhoven I\u2019m involved in \u2014 Eindhoven is a tight community, so I\u2019ve had the chance to watch them closely. And they make for an interesting story.", "For all their relative obscurity, the young team at Amber has the ambitious goal of becoming the Spotify or Netflix of mobility. They don\u2019t sell cars; they sell access to cars. It sounds like just another car-sharing service, but there\u2019s a twist. Amber says it can guarantee there is always a car available within walking distance, no matter where you are. And they only do electric.", "I spoke with Nelemans last week when he was in San Francisco talking to investors. \u201cIn a nomal car-sharing service, you see a map with the nearest available car,\u201d he told me. \u201cBut it may be a mile away, it may be dirty, it may not work. You never know for sure. We can guarantee the car is always close by, clean, and in working order.\u201d", "Using predictive analysis algorithms, Amber\u2019s software platform calculates where its cars will be needed in the next 15 minutes. Then, under the service\u2019s current, initial rollout, it delivers cars to those locations using students as drivers. If a car is not there when you need it, Amber calls you a cab. \u201cAs our software gets better the cabs will not be needed anymore,\u201d said Nelemans.", "The student drivers will also disappear eventually. This is where Amber\u2019s self-driving ambition kicks in. In between rides the cars have to be able to drive themselves to their next users. All that without a human on board and by mid-2018. It sounds ridiculously overconfident, but Nelemans has thought it through.", "In the beginning Amber will let its cars drive themselves only at night when roads are empty. By making nightly miles the cars accumulate data, learn, and become better. Eventually they can self-drive during the day, first on easy backroads, later in busier traffic. \u201cOther companies working at self-driving technology have trouble testing because they always need an engineer behind the wheel,\u201d said Nelemans. \u201cOur cars are driving during the day with normal drivers to accumulate data. And at night they accumulate even more data in the self-driving mode. We can learn much faster.\u201d", "The fact that there\u2019s no human on board that needs to be protected during this initial self-driving stage also makes it safer. \u201c[For the time being,] we designed the car so that it takes all the heat in an eventual accident, sparing its surroundings,\u201d Nelemans told me. \u201cThat way you avoid the moral dilemma of choosing between driving yourself off a bridge or hitting the mother and child.\u201d", "The startup isn\u2019t breaking a sweat over developing its own self-driving software. Amber is partnering with five different software companies and research institutes, including Nvidia and Microsoft, that have already developed self-driving software. It may not be state of the art, but Nelemans says it\u2019s good enough. \u201cMaybe not good enough for Uber, Tesla, or Google, but our user case is much simpler. We can move in smaller segments instead of immediately jumping to full autonomous driving in busy traffic.\u201d", "Right now the BMW i3 is Amber\u2019s electric car of choice. Yet the company is also building its own electric car, The Amber One, expected in 2021 and designed to last a million miles. It\u2019s equipped with modular components that can be easily replaced. \u201cA normal car is built to break down after 200,000 miles, because car companies make money in repairs and they have to sell new cars,\u201d Nelemans said. \u201cIn our business model the cars belong to us. That\u2019s an incentive to make them as long lasting as possible with minimum service costs.\u201d", "\u201cIf Google, Uber, and Tesla would join forces, you would see a fully self-driving car on the road in a matter of weeks,\u201d said Nelemans. \u201cBut they all want to be first. That\u2019s why they\u2019re constantly stealing each others engineers. We leave the engineers at the automotive companies and just develop technology with them. It keeps both our costs and risks down.\u201d", "And whereas disruptors like Uber and AirBnB are often exchanging punches with local governments, Amber has been successful in forming government partnerships. The cities of Eindhoven and Helmond have already voiced their support for Amber\u2019s mission, offering them city streets for testing self-driving cars and local networks for finding investors. \u201cWe really believe in the development of autonomous driving,\u201d said Gert Blom, strategic mobility advisor at the city of Helmond. \u201cIt\u2019s going to happen and we try to participate as actively as we can.\u201d", "The Netherlands is also leading in self-driving legislation. The Dutch vehicle registration authority RDW was the first of its kind in Europe to approve Tesla\u2019s self-driving features. If Amber\u2019s tests are good enough, it stands a fair chance of being approved as well.", "Amber\u2019s location in The Netherlands offers several perks. The Dutch scored highest on electronic vehicle sales, EV infrastructure, and public interest in autonomous driving.", "The startup has about 10 experienced advisors that are providing ", "pro bono", " advice and expertise. \u201cSometimes their ambitions seem unrealistically high,\u201d one of their advisors, Carlo van de Weijer, told me. \u201cBut we\u2019ve learned to restrain our skepticism, because often enough we\u2019ve been surprised by their results.\u201d", "Nelemans has sometimes expressed disappointment at what he calls a lack of ambition in his home country. There\u2019s a famous saying in Holland: normal is crazy enough. Being a nation of traders and bankers, the Dutch tend to frown at goals that seem too far reaching. \u201cWhen I talk to Dutch investors about our mission of being self-driving next year, none of them believe we can actually do it. \u2018That only happens in America\u2019, they say.\u201d", "Money is another issue. Amber wants to raise $70 million. Nelemans: \u201cDutch investors thought the amount was too high. The first time I pitched to investors in Silicon Valley, they thought it was too low.\u201d", "Nelemans isn\u2019t afraid Amber will suffer from the kind of problems ", "that have plagued Uber", ". Neither am I. He seems too level-headed to start shouting at employees. At the same time he can\u2019t be accused of too much modesty either. When I asked him whether his mobility-for-all mission would stop at conquering The Netherlands, he snickered.", "\u201cOur ambition is to conquer the entire world.\u201d", "Bert-Jan Woertman is commercial director of the ", "Eindhoven University of Technology", "."]}

After jumping through hoops to get your crowdfunding campaign live, your video is many times an afterthought. We recently analyzed over 200 campaigns to gauge how important videos are in crowdfunding.", "A quick bit of background: Crowdfunding campaigns are open on average 93 days. Issuers must meet their funding target to receive invested capital; otherwise, it goes back to the investors, and the campaign is considered closed and failed.", "We analyzed 243 closed campaigns. Of those, 51 percent (123) got funded. These campaigns are raising more capital than their failed counterparts \u2014 a lot more. On average, they raise 16.5 times more per campaign than a failed one, capture an impressive $277,000, and monumentally overshadow the average $16,000 a failed campaign raises. Given the SEC does not allow failed campaigns to keep their funds, it is imperative for issuers to ensure all their campaign efforts are fine tuned.", "Our analysis focused on the campaign video as a highly visible, yet commonly misunderstood fundraising driver. We dissecting each video\u2019s essential components through a weighted quality-rating system based on a 10-point scale. A perfect 10 video exceptionally demonstrated the following elements:", "Campaign videos scoring in the range of 0 to 3 points are considered poor, 4 to 6 points average, 7 to 8 points good, and 9 to 10 points excellent.", "Videos rated poor typically do not engage the audience or compel an investor to invest because of missing key information about the product or because the product or service present more questions than answers. These videos also lack professional production quality.", "Average videos have most the essential components listed in our weighted rating system but are somewhat lacking in professional production quality, audience engagement, business opportunity details, and funding needs.", "Good videos are professionally done and provide solid audience engagement with a compelling business opportunity. They address most components in our weighted-rating system but leave out one or two key details \u2014 most commonly an explanation of a business\u2019s funding needs and plans.", "Excellent videos are professionally done, emotionally engaging, and provide a compelling business opportunity. They tick all the boxes in our weighted-rating system, leaving the investor informed, confident, and excited about the investment opportunity.", "In addition to categorizing videos by quality, we also tagged campaigns by the type of audience they target: 1) \u201cExplainers\u201d are essentially commercials tailored for the consumer audience, leaving out key investor information (i.e. the investment opportunity, market potential, team introductions, experience, and funding needs), and 2) \u201cPitches\u201d are videos with a message tailored for the investor, including everything an explainer does plus what they typically leave out.", "For a video categorized as an explainer to score well, it needed to strongly engage the audience through its production quality, emotional pull, testimonials, and creative business solution, since it lacks more concrete business information.", "Our findings led us to four recommendations:", "1. Investing in quality reaps maximum returns. ", "The majority of campaigns funded (82 percent) have a video of average quality or better. Having at least an average quality video is becoming more of a prerequisite for an increased chance of meeting the funding target, but this doesn\u2019t ensure above average funding. In fact, successful campaigns raised an average of $277,000. If you look at the chart below, you will see that those with an average quality video only raised $222,000 \u2014 20 percent below average, while those with good quality videos raise 16.5 percent more than the average. Not surprisingly, campaigns with excellent video quality do even better, raising 32 percent above average.", "Intero Ristorante", " is an example of an excellent campaign video that helped the company raise double its funding target. The founders engage investors with a compelling story, background, and business mission through a professional quality video.", "A word of caution: Even though campaigns with no video have a smaller success rate, when they do succeed, they raise more money than campaigns with average quality videos. If you are looking to just make your minimal funding target, then your campaign has a good chance of falling into that 82 percent of average quality videos that are funded, but investing in quality clearly yields maximum returns.", "2. Pitch videos get funded more and raise more funds. ", "Our data shows it pays to inform your investor audience. We divided campaigns into those with no video, those that used an explainer, and those that used a pitch. Those using pitch videos show a much higher funding success rate (75 percent) than those with explainer videos, which were funded 18 percent less. And those with no video at all were funded 67 percent less than pitch campaigns.\u00a0", "Campaigns with pitch videos are also raised more money \u2014 $294,000 on average \u2014 which is 6 percent more than the average funded campaign, 7 percent more than those with explainer videos, and 25 percent more than funded campaigns with no video at all. So, at a minimum, when putting your video script together it\u2019s a good idea to answer some of the questions an investor might have about your company, team, or market rather than just explain how your product works.", "3. Length doesn\u2019t guarantee funding success. ", "Does video length matter? Well, yes and no. We analyzed video lengths by categorizing them into short (0 to 1.5 minute), medium (1.5-3 minute), lengthy (3-5 minute), and very lengthy (over 5 minutes). We found that short, medium, and lengthy videos all have a funding success rate above the average 51 average ( 69 percent, 71 percent, and 62 percent, respectively), which further signals that having a video is better than no video, regardless of its length.", "Medium to lengthy videos, ranging anywhere from 1.5 min to 5 min long, raise the most capital in total and raise more than the average campaign by 4 percent and 16 percent respectively. Interestingly, the majority of pitch videos fall into these two categories, thus honing in the point that it\u2019s worth taking the time to appropriately inform potential investors.", "Campaigns with very lengthy videos appear to be an anomaly. They raise more than 2 times the average funded campaign ($601,000 on average) but are only funded half the time (they make up less than 5 percent of all funded campaigns). They also vary wildly in the amount of capital raised \u2014 anywhere from $64,000 to $1 million. Since a very lengthy video doesn\u2019t guarantee six-figure funding, and it\u2019s possible to have funding success with any reasonable length of video, length should be viewed in terms of how well you have informed and engaged your investor audience with the critical video quality components.", "4. Positioning your campaign amongst quality brings greater returns.", "Only 43 percent (104) of the campaigns we looked at had videos. Of this group, we rated 54 percent as being of good or excellent quality. We found the quality unevenly dispersed throughout the various equity crowdfunding portals. Of the 56 total campaigns rated as having good or excellent quality video, 45 percent ran on Wefunder, with Microventure and Start Engine coming a far second, hosting 16 percent of campaigns with top quality videos. Since we know that higher quality videos bring higher returns, it makes sense for issuers to position themselves within a portal that curates a higher level of quality campaigns. Looking at the chart below, you will also notice that Microventures and StartEngine have a higher percent of excellent videos. (And Microventures\u2019 average funded campaign is $295,547 vs. Wefunder\u2019s $284,631, although Seedinvest wins that race with the average funded campaign of $413,698).", "Investing in a video specifically tailored for your equity crowdfunding campaign shows dedication and commitment to your potential investors. It also visually displays for them what you can accomplish and, subconsciously, what you can execute with capital. What the data shows is that if you are looking to raise a minimum of $50,000, investing in a decent video will most likely ensure your funding target is met. But if you are looking to raise at least $277,000, investing in an excellent quality video will maximize your returns.", "A final point of consideration is your actual return on investment. Given that competition is strong among videographers and that a professionally executed video can be done for as little as $5,000, the potential returns on a good campaign video versus a poor one are significantly greater \u2014 almost 6x more.", "Be sure to take a look at our story from yesterday on ", "how your social media following is likely to affect the success of your crowdfunding campaign", ", too.", "Sherwood Neiss is a partner at ", "Crowdfund Capital Advisors", ".

We\u2019ve done such a good job of creating these characters and making them look so real. All of a sudden when you hear that sound come out of me, it\u2019s a weird juxtaposition.", "GamesBeat: You\u2019ve done a lot of different voices over the years. Where does that come from?", "Baker:", " You know, I don\u2019t know. There\u2019s a lot of people running around in my head. When I was a kid, this is what I did. I played pretend. Everybody tries to find a way to create a career out what they love doing, what their passion is, what they naturally like to do. I\u2019ve been fortunate enough to be able to do that. And not just in past games, but now to be able to come back and play a character that is now part of Middle-earth lore. That\u2019s a pretty big feather in my cap. And not just as an actor, but as the director of the performance capture now.", "GamesBeat: Is this the first time you\u2019ve done that kind of capture?", "Baker:", " We did it on the first game as well. Then we came back for this and \u2014 when I went to Monolith up in Seattle, they wanted to pitch me the game and show me what they were thinking about doing. Took me beat by beat through that conversation. It became an opportunity for me to be like the quarterback, I guess. We have a great coach. Mike de Plater is our coach, and he has the vision for this game. But the able to execute that for the other actors kind of became my job.", "GamesBeat: Does it get easier to do your lines if you\u2019re motion-capturing at the same time?", "Baker:", " The more connected you can be to any performance, whatever that means, the better. We shoot this like we would a show or a film. As opposed to just being in a vacuum, being by yourself, having to imagine the world, we do our best on that sound stage with all the actors together on the set. Just like you would \u2014 it\u2019s like theater. Stage on film is a great way to put it.", "Once we have all our actors moving in the space together, blocking out the scenes, discussing dramatically and narratively what\u2019s at stake in the scenes, working and parsing through those, for me it\u2019s always easier to build a more believable character and invest a more believable performance. You\u2019re actually in the space, holding a sword, fighting somebody, or having a more intimate dramatic moment.", "Above: The Bright Lord in Shadow of War.", "GamesBeat: With Talion, how would you see he\u2019s different as a character and a voice-acting performance in this game?", "Baker:", " I\u2019d actually remove voice acting from it completely. A character is a character and acting is acting. To me, if you focus too much on the voice, you forget that this is a three-dimensional character. He\u2019s not a disembodied voice walking around. This is a person that has legs and arms and face and a body moving around. Especially with Talion \u2014 in the first game we saw someone who\u2019d just lost his family. He was hell-bent on revenge. Shadow of Mordor was really a story about revenge.", "Shadow of War is a story about domination. We\u2019ve picked a fight with the devil. We\u2019re bringing the war to Sauron\u2019s gates. In order to do that we have to build our army. To me, what makes Talion such a different kind of character is that it\u2019s really up to you as a gamer what kind of character you want him to be. This isn\u2019t a Choose Your Own Adventure, but it\u2019s very much about who you choose to recruit, who you ally yourself with, and how you use those people to accomplish your goals. All that says a lot about you as a person and a lot about Talion as a character.", "GamesBeat: There\u2019s some charisma in there. What other range do you find in that character?", "Baker:", " There\u2019s someone who is truly lost, in the sense that \u2014 the purpose he thought he had in this world has been taken from him. If you played the first game, at the end he finds out that he\u2019s been used as a pawn. Now he\u2019s taking that and, with the crafting of the new ring, choosing to make his own destiny, choosing to be a man with his own purpose, his own identity. It\u2019s a pretty broad range. It\u2019s a character that, just like Aragorn or Boromir\u2014he stands shoulder to shoulder with them.", "Above: Shadow of War", "GamesBeat: ", "The story trailer was pretty fascinating to me", ". I wondered what I should guess from that.", "Baker:", " I love that you can do that. What would you guess?", "GamesBeat: Well, Shelob is a woman who changes form back and forth, from a woman to this giant spider. She has a ring. Talion\u2019s at one point friendly with her, or trying to kill her. She seems to play an interesting role in the story. It\u2019s a piece of the lore we never knew anything about. The other thing I\u2019m guessing is that he\u2019s forced to raise this orc army to fight against Sauron, but he\u2019ll probably have to deal with Gondor at the same time.", "Baker:", " This, to me \u2014 when first put this game out and launched the first trailer, we saw the Reddit threads exploding. This has become a part of our culture. Middle-earth lore has been a part of our culture for 80 years now. In that time, people have become scholars and earned degrees in Tolkien lore. It\u2019s not lost on us that we have to be careful. There\u2019s no one that\u2019s more precious about the lore than Michael de Plater and the people at Monolith. But what I love is watching the conversations going back and forth.", "Someone asked me earlier today, \u201cDo you have a problem when people disagree with you and pick your stuff apart?\u201d No. If we\u2019re a part of the conversation, that means we\u2019re a part of the conversation. I\u2019d much rather people be speculating and debating about this than not talking about it at all. Ultimately, you\u2019ll find out what the story is October 10.", "GamesBeat: Remind me of some of your other big roles in games?", "Baker:", " I played Joel in The Last of Us. Booker de Witt in BioShock Infinite. I just played Sam in Uncharted 4.", "GamesBeat: When you think of those characters, what are you doing differently this time?", "Baker:", " I treat each character as its own thing. I try not to carbon-copy a character. A lot of that starts the same way as anything else. It just starts on the page.", "GamesBeat: You can\u2019t let Joel slip into voice here.", "Baker:", " No, because then that\u2019s Troy doing something. It\u2019s not doing a service to this character.", "Above: Shadow of War will have a vast open world.", "GamesBeat: In some ways, I wonder where this is going as far as \u2014 at some point, the ability to capture you and put you into the game is going to get so precise that it could be you that goes directly in, rather than a sort of painted-up you. What do you see as far as this could go?", "Baker:", " To me, the more you want to go one-to-one \u2014 there\u2019s that uncanny valley. I think that one thing this medium offers us is the opportunity to be a more fantastical version of ourselves. It\u2019s the same thing people do with Instagram or anything else like that. You don\u2019t necessarily post the most honest pictures of yourself. You take a picture of yourself that flatters you, that makes you look better. That\u2019s one of the reasons why we play games. We want to escape this and be a ranger of Gondor that\u2019s assaulting a fortress full of orcs. That\u2019s why we play games. If it was about doing our taxes, we wouldn\u2019t play games.", "GamesBeat: With Talion, he\u2019s a character torn by choices he has to make.", "Baker:", " Absolutely. A good story is all about choices, the choices we make and the consequences that follow. That level of choice extends to you as a player as well.", "GamesBeat: It reminds me of The Last of Us in that way.", "Baker:", " That\u2019s a common theme throughout games and throughout everything else.

If you see a zombie, you shoot it in another game. But in State of Decay 2, there are consequences. If you shoot a zombie, you make noise. That will draw other zombies.

That means she is valuable to a community, as she can create crops for people to eat.

I am not advocating this approach for everyone, as investing is never one-size-fits-all, but by sharing my criteria I hope to inspire you to come up with your own set of priorities.", "My criteria:", "1. Customers", " \u2014 Are the products or services delivered going to benefit the customer (e.g. improves the lives of customers, reasonable pricing)?", "2. Community ", "\u2014 Is the business model going to benefit the community? Are there potential harmful effects?", "3.

Employees", " \u2014 Are the business leaders committed to creating a great environment for their employees? (e.g. employees treated as valued team members, supportive work environment, diversity practices, success trickles down to employees)", "For me, the ultimate test of how well my investments are working is how well they meet my four criteria over time and whether they deliver attractive financial outcomes. As only one investment has had an exit so far, I can only gauge the performance of the rest based on interim indicators of success or failure. I can also compare the performance of investments using these criteria against those that I made solely to achieve outsized financial gains.", "Here\u2019s how I used these criteria, with real examples of a few investments:", "Opportunity A:", " \u00a0A startup taking an innovative approach to education for autistic children, founded by a friend with a passion for creating a better world for those with autism and success in starting, growing, and exiting a company in the financial analytics space.

The market for food delivery was attracting new entrants, and a couple of players were starting to gain dominance. The new CEO had experience in the industry and promised to fix the mistakes made by the earlier executive team and narrow down the business model while reducing the burn rate.", "I had limited information and little or no history on these startups \u2014 except in some cases the founders\u2019 previous track records \u2014 so evaluation them required a lot of judgement and may seem arbitrary. I initially tried to rate each investment \u201cHigh, Medium, or Low\u201d but ended up modifying my approach to rating my first two criteria (benefit to customers and community) as \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d \u2014 trying to avoid business that would only succeed by taking advantage of less sophisticated consumers or be negative for the community (or country) at large. I also introduced an \u201cUnclear\u201d rating rather than force a conclusion where one was difficult to draw. Ultimately, the evaluation did more to help me organize and structure my thinking than to serve as the final say in an investment decision. The exercise proved valuable when combined with investor presentations, financial and return projections, and conversations with the founding teams and other knowledgeable experts from my network. Nobody said this was easy.", "Below is the performance of these opportunities, again keeping in mind that it is not over until it is over (meaning an IPO, an exit, or a failure):", "Opportunity A", "Opportunity B", "Opportunity C", "Investing in startups can be risky and rewarding. You have to think through prospects carefully, seek advice from those with experience, assess the economics, and appreciate the risks, but that still won\u2019t guarantee success. One of the most critical factors driving success is the founding team. \u00a0I now look for a combination of passion for growth and innovation combined with solid experience in dealing with the areas of challenge that lie ahead. An ideal team balances the mix of someone not bogged down with experience that would keep them from disrupting, combined with some relevant experience that can help them navigate the maze of complexity without holding back innovation. For fintech, I find the need for experience on the team to be very important, while for consumer products it\u2019s less important, unless success depends on conventional distribution channels (i.e. stores) where relevant experience is critical.", "Another complicating factor is navigating forces outside the control of the business. Managing factors in the control of the company is difficult enough, but navigating external factors such as economic and credit cycles or dealing with the changing demand for loans in the secondary market does require experience. For businesses that need in-house employees (vs. outsourced resources), previous experience in recruiting talent and scaling up can also be a differentiator.", "Ultimately, though, even seemingly great opportunities with dream teams may not succeed. I have learned to not overinvest in any one opportunity, only invest what I am prepared to lose, keep accumulating experience and insights, and remember that a portfolio of carefully screened, non-correlated investments may produce the best results. You can listen to others, read about approaches and results but must realize that, in the final analysis, you alone make the call and will bear the success or the failure.", "S.A.

In Guns of Icarus, now known as Flight of the Icarus, players are a privateer on an airship in a post-apocalyptic world. The game was made by four people in just six months.

But it shouldn\u2019t.", "Company growth can vastly change your sales tax nexus footprint (the obligation to collect sales tax in a state based on sales activities in that state).

But backing a venture is a big decision \u2014 a risky one \u2014 and investors don\u2019t fund deals without first doing their homework. For any financing event, public or private, investors not only look closely at how you plan to grow the business but also how you are managing it now. This includes tax compliance and audit histories.", "The impact of sales tax on company valuation is often underestimated. But that can be detrimental. If there is a funding round, company sale, or IPO, being clean and consistent and having an auditable record is of the utmost importance. Poor sales tax management practices or unfavorable audit outcomes can impact valuation, jeopardize funding or even nullify deals.", "High-visibility events like funding rounds and IPOs can also bring your business to the attention of state auditors looking to draw in more tax dollars. Companies with a higher profile and higher revenues tend to be chosen for audits more often warns Shane Ratigan, a tax attorney and compliance manager for Avalara.", "Several states have nexus discovery units within their revenue departments that scour public information to find companies that are not compliant with their states\u2019 laws. The more you \u201cstand out from the crowd\u201d among other businesses, the more likely they are to pay attention to your situation.", "Andrew Johnson, Managing Partner at Peisner Johnson, LLP notes, \u201cIn some cases, an acquiring company requires the seller to provide a \u2018tax clearance certificate\u2019 or its equivalent from states where the target company is doing business.

After the deal is inked and the excitement wanes, you\u2019re now faced with bringing together one or more organizations that, while aligned in some areas of the business, may not be in others.", "It\u2019s a concern that keeps company executives up at night.

Between due diligence, integration, accounting/financial reporting, and post-acquisition compliance, who has time for the minutia of sales tax? Not finance, operations, and IT; they\u2019re focused elsewhere. Yet, many of the reasons for acquiring a business \u2014 more market share, a broader product mix, even physical property \u2014 are common tax liability triggers. During the integration process, it can be easy to overlook new or different tax obligations, such as nexus, jurisdictional rate changes, or product taxability rules. This can lead to over or undercharging sales tax and raise red flags with auditors.", "Additionally, the target company may have been carrying tax attributes on its books or ongoing tax audits that could transfer to the new organization. If these aren\u2019t properly identified and managed as part of the due diligence during the deal, they could cause compliance problems later.", "During periods of growth or change, it\u2019s good practice for CFOs or controllers to dive deeper into how compliance is being managed, identify vulnerabilities, and look for new or better ways to operationalize or optimize the business.", "CPA Firms understand the importance of indirect tax compliance and routinely advise clients to automate sales tax during systems integrations to reduce compliance costs and audit risk. Failure to properly integrate systems may prevent the company from \u201cspeaking with one voice\u201d on the taxability of the same or similar products and services in a merger of equals. While it\u2019s understandable that differences may exist early on in the process, such discrepancies are harder to explain or defend over time.", "Changes to sales tax rates and rules are often done last minute or with minimal notice, so it\u2019s not always easy to know when they happen or how they affect you. If you are having to make these updates manually in several different systems or server locations, it\u2019s a lot harder to ensure consistency and timeliness, which could impact sales and customer service. Automating this process removes this risk.", "If your company is growing, it\u2019s highly likely that you\u2019ll be engaged in one or more of these change events. When that happens, your attention and resources will be strained and focused elsewhere \u2014 not on sales tax compliance.", "Having sales tax automated in your ERP, ecommerce system, or other financial application ensures that you\u2019re able to keep up with your compliance obligations as your business grows or changes. Cloud applications like Avalara that integrate easily with your existing systems help protect against lost or spotty data resulting from a platform change, upgrade, or consolidation.

Add this to the $121 billion in dry powder that is already waiting to be deployed to the world\u2019s most promising startups.", "Despite a shortage in VC-backed exits, investors continue to place bets on VC as it remains one of the asset classes where they can benefit from outsized performance. The allure of finding the next Silicon Valley unicorn such as Uber, Slack, or AirBnB is a powerful motivator. On a historical basis, VC funds have consistently outperformed all other fund types over three-year and five-year horizons \u2013 PE, debt funds, fund of funds, according to our data. In 2014 and 2015, VC funds returned $119 billion to investors, which has since led to a large amount of reinvestment in the asset class.", "We also found that the median time to exit for VC-backed companies in the U.S. has crept to 8.2 years for an IPO and five years for acquisitions or buyouts, the highest levels recorded in the last decade.", "Many startups are opting to raise a down or flat round or find ways to lengthen their cash runway rather than go through a liquidity event. Take BuzzFeed as a perfect example of this trend. The unicorn startup secured $200 million in late stage financing late last year, valued at $1.7 billion and is reportedly aiming for $350 million in revenue this year. Also on this list are Houzz, Qualtrics, WeWork, Ola, and AirBnB, to name a few.", "This trend is creating a cyclical challenge for investors. They continue to fund late-stage companies, arming them with healthy cash reserves to stay private longer, which impacts their ability to generate returns for limited partners in a timely manner. Global VC contributions from 2012 through 2015 were the highest of any four-year period since 2002, with nearly $175 billion paid in. But the returns distributed from these contributions are lagging. The latest global net cash flow reports we looked at show VCs still owe $12.8 billion to their investors \u2013 and that\u2019s just to break even. The consequence of this is a level of illiquidity that limited partners had not planned for, which impacts expected and actual returns as well as fees paid.", "So, where does this \u201cnew normal\u201d lead us? At this point, it will be several years before the venture asset class will know if the \u201cstaying private longer but growing bigger\u201d (aka the Unicorn experiment) is positive or negative for returns. In the meantime, investors must grapple with the bigger unanswered question of what the VC industry will look like if the expected fund lifetime stretches to 15 years? That is, what are the return expectations on that duration of illiquidity? How do fees get charged? What happens to key man clauses (15 years is half a career\u2026) etc.?", "The trend of staying private longer will only continue, especially after watching the early challenges faced in the public market by unicorn companies like Facebook, Twitter, and more recently Snap. While staying private longer allows more time to establish profitability, waiting too long only increases pressure to maintain nearly impossible levels of growth, and market forces could shift making an exit unwise.", "It\u2019s clear the VC industry is in the middle of a development phase, but how it will emerge on the other side remains a question mark. The stigma associated with early stage investors exiting in later stage rounds will soon become obsolete as the industry accepts it not as signaling risk but as a fiduciary duty by the early VCs. Limited partners and general partners are already thinking seriously about addressing more permanent capital structures.", "Adley Bowden", " is Vice President of Market Development and Analysis at ", "PitchBook", "."]}

It turns out it was due to three factors. First, simplicity. It\u2019s still easier to flip on lights with your finger when you walk into a room. Second, choice. Selecting between options, such as songs/playlists/channels for music players, is far more natural with a screen. Third, interactive feedback. It\u2019s much faster to adjust dimming levels for lights or sound levels for music with the slide of a finger than by issuing successive commands until you find the right level.", "Voice computing still had a role.

The full realization of ambient computing will make it fun and delightful to interact with our homes, rather than forcing us to rely on the clunky mobile phone-driven or voice-only interactions that exist today. We will see this in products from big players like Amazon but also from the companies they power with their open platforms, such as our company. If Google and Apple also open their platforms to third parties, I think we will be surprised at how quickly homes without ambient computing begin to feel outdated and frustrating.

The upside is unlimited and the penalties are non-existent. Apple can change the paradigm.", "One thing Apple is getting right, though, according to Rushkoff, is the lack of personalization options for its News widget.", "The first time a distrusted media outlet appeared in my widget, I dove into the depths of Apple News and emerged with a dozen sources added and blacklisted. Wiping the water from my eyes, I looked up at the scoreboard only to see that it hadn\u2019t changed.", "It turns out that while you can customize Apple News to jelly, those changes don\u2019t carry over into its widget. And the widget doesn\u2019t appear to take your reading activity into account (I tested this with three iPhone devices).", "While I found this lack of customization personally frustrating, especially in lieu of the problems discussed earlier, Rushkoff sees it as necessary. He praised Apple\u2019s decision to show everyone the same headlines and contrasted that decision with Facebook and Google\u2019s take on the news, which hides too much. \u201cAt least with a newspaper, you knew the stories you were ignoring,\u201d said Rushkoff, \u201cthey stayed in your awareness.\u201d With Apple\u2019s News widget, that\u2019s true again.", "The short answer is \u201cobsessive human curation.\u201d The long answer is:", "So far, I\u2019ve referred to Apple News as \u201cApple News.\u201d That\u2019s the official designation on the App Store, but not what the app calls itself.

The idea is to make construction safer by using AI on jobs that safety experts can\u2019t physically get to in a day, said Josh Kanner, CEO of Smartvid.io.", "Construction generates more than\u00a0$10 trillion a year in revenues, but accidents lead to more than 1,000 deaths a year. In addition to the human tragedy, those accidents create additional costs of more than $600 billion dollars annually,\u00a0said Mike Perozek, vice president of sales and marketing.", "\u201cSafety in construction is a huge problem. One in 10 American workers are hurt each year,\u201d said Perozek. \u201c[Safety experts] walk job sites with clip boards, pencils, and sometimes tablet computers. They are looking for safety risks. The problem is there are way too few of these experts to go around. It\u2019s common for a safety manager to lead three to seven large active projects.\u201d", "But Smartvid.io figured out there is already\u00a0a huge number of photos and videos being created at construction sites, with more than 15,000 to 20,000 photos generated per project per year. Those are generated to track progress and enable communication. But that photo and video data is often wasted, and Smartvid.io is unlocking the value of that content to analyze it for safety information.", "\u201cWe put [it] in one place, organize it, and bring it into the construction management system,\u201d Perozek. \u201cWe can alert individuals to do something without a safety expert being involved.\u201d", "Smartvid.io automates the process of importing video into its app. Then the company\u2019s safety AI analyzes the data for safety issues. All of the images are made searchable, and safety managers can make use of them. The system has integrated work flows and alerts. Workers get a suggestion from Smartvid.io, and they can rate that suggestion, which feeds back into the AI model.", "It takes about five to seven years to get safety experts trained. But Smartvid.io uses computer vision, deep learning, and speech recognition to quantify objects of interest and identify possible hazards. Now a junior worker can walk the job site everyday with a camera and upload the video for Smartvid.io to analyze.", "Smartvid.io is working on early adopters now. The company doubled its number of customers from four to eight in the first quarter. It charges a subscription for its software, based on the number of users or projects.", "Kanner said, \u201cWe are starting with safety and see a huge opportunity to use AI to tackle other inherently visual expert-based tasks in construction, from productivity measurement to defect identification and tracking. On the latter, we recently completed a case study on using computer vision to find and measure cracks in infrastructure. Given the current focus on infrastructure in our current administration we\u2019re very excited about this line of work as well.\u201d", "Above: Eli David, CTO of Deep Instinct.", "Tel Aviv-based Deep Instinct is applying AI to the task of detecting malware. About 1 million new variants of malware are spread every day. Often, a new family of malware is only about 30 percent different from the code of something that came before. Many antivirus vendors focus on detecting known malware in a library, using reactive technology.", "But Deep Instinct believes the better solution is deep learning, which can be used to detect unknown malware in real time. It doesn\u2019t detect virus signatures, sandboxing of content, or heuristics. Instead, it only looks at the binary raw details of the file in question. And Deep Instinct doesn\u2019t require frequent updates, said\u00a0Eli David, chief technology officer at Deep Instinct. It trains the deep learning neural network\u00a0on hundreds of millions of files. In short, it focuses on prevention, not reaction.", "\u201cWe do not wait for the attack execution,\u201d David said. \u201cWe protect against malware, anything from simple mutations up to nation-state attacks.\u201d", "The company built its own deep learning infrastructure from scratch, as it had to develop its own flavor of neural networks. The software runs efficiently on the combination of central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs) and Nvidia\u2019s CUDA software for running non-graphics software on graphics chips. The GPUs enable the company to do in a day what would take three months for a CPU.", "Deep Instinct prunes 95 percent of the unnecessary processing threads so that it has a much smaller amount of data to analyze.\u00a0The results are about 99 percent on detection rates, based on independent tests with its customers. By comparison, the competition gets about 80 percent detection.", "Deep Instinct has\u00a0a very low false-positive rate of about 0.1 percent, compared with 2 percent to 3 percent for a deep-learning rival, David said. And Deep Instinct only has to be updated every few months or so. The company\u00a0started commercializing its software in 2016, and it expects to generate $10 million in revenue this year.", "In 2018, it hopes to add a solution for traffic analysis, and it will expand to all other areas of cybersecurity over time.\u00a0Rivals include companies like Cylance. Deep Instinct has 65 employes and has raised $50 million from Blumberg Capital, UST Global, CNTP, and Cerracap. The toughest problem is that people don\u2019t understand what is in Deep Instinct\u2019s \u201cblack box,\u201d and they want to know how it works. But the company can easily demonstrate how it beats rivals at detecting the same problems, David said, and that usually convinces prospective customers.", "Above: Cape Analytics sales chief Busy Cummings", "Home insurance companies have to collect data on more than 100 million homes in the U.S. That isn\u2019t easy, and Cape Analytics is using geospatial imagery, computer vision, and machine learning to help.", "Cape Analytics can collect aerial images that reveal a lot about a home, if they are properly analyzed, said Busy Cummings, vice president of sales. The initial focus is on the property insurance industry, but many others, from tax assessors to inspectors, also need a lot more data about homes.", "Home owners are often unreliable sources of information about their own homes, partly because they many not know the answers and partly because they may understand how to game the system to get lower insurance rates, Cummings said. Public records are also a frequently used source of data, but they are often outdated. And using inspectors is costly and often time-consuming.", "\u201cThe inspectors provide good information that affects valuation and pricing,\u201d Cummings said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a horrible experience because it arrives so late. [With this technology] we get the data in a timely way with the accuracy of inspection.\u201d", "Cape Analytics gets the aerial imagery from other sources, and it can show big changes, like a home being remodeled or damage from a big storm. It can also reveal risks, like lots of trees surrounding a home. Cape Analytics uses tens of thousands of GPUs to process the data in a fraction of the time it would otherwise take.", "It can find out the shape and condition of a roof and what materials it\u2019s made of. It can identify swimming pools, diving boards, pool enclosures, and other things. All of that data can be important. It shortens the application process and results in a faster insurance quote.", "\u201cWe are building a living database of the 100 million homes in the U.S.,\u201d Cummings said. \u201cIt improves the customer relationship with a shorter application process. It is better quality, faster, and less money.

This can monitor the movement of tracks and the condition of switches. One of Konux\u2019s customers is Deutsche Bahn, the German train company, which has more than 70,000 switches on its tracks throughout Europe.", "Those switches require about five manual inspections a year, each requiring about three people for a minimum two-hour inspection. Deutsche Bahn spends hundreds of millions of dollars\u00a0a year on switch maintenance. It\u2019s a huge annual expense. And the labor cost across all rail companies around the world runs into the many billions of dollars.", "Konux\u2019s sensors gather information so the inspections aren\u2019t needed as often. And as equipment fails, Konux gets alerts about the condition of the devices. Trains pass over the switches 20 times a day, which can cause deterioration in the switch. If a switch fails, it can result in a delays or even a train collision with catastrophic results.", "\u201cIf you know how much usage a switch has had, you know when you should replace it,\u201d Lata said. \u201cThe major rail companies want this product because it solves one of the big problems on their balance sheets.\u201d", "Each sale can be a big one, but the sales cycle is long.", "Konux has more than 30 employees, and it has raised $18.5 million from NEA, Michael Baum, Andy Bechtolsheim, MIG Fonds, Torsten Kreindl, and Lothar Stein.

Back then, Kick was a character artist with Sony Online Entertainment, but was getting a little tired of making games for others.

Software enables managers to track each person\u2019s contribution to make sure everyone is generating what they need to for the project.

With crowdfunding platforms, such as Kickstarter and Fig, it\u2019s easier for a studio to work on a project without needing to make a deal (and share future revenue) with a publisher. Game engines, such as Unity and Unreal, are incredibly powerful, but also free to use until you start selling the product you\u2019ve created. And there are a bunch of digital-sales platforms on which to retail a product, so a developer can self-publish quite easily. Even if the developer opts to work with a publisher to bring a product to market, Kuperman says there are still benefits from those tools.", "\u201cA developer can be relatively self-sufficient and come to the publisher, saying \u2018Look at what I\u2019ve produced so far.

The first issue I have with Epicenter\u2019s implant initiative is that it is trying to solve a problem \u2014 hassle free payment/printing/door opening \u2014 for which equally effective and less invasive solutions already exist. The implanted RFID chip is no different from the one on a standard office key fob or an Oyster-style travel card that provides users with a unique identifier that can be read by scanners near doors or at pay points.

While this might seem like basic data that can\u2019t be used for much, data science can transform trivial information into insights into a user\u2019s life. For example, in theory, a company could mine data from an implanted microchip and work out that it takes some employees longer than others to get from door A to door B on the 4th floor and decide to fire the slow ones first.", "While this scenario is unlikely in real life, questions still arise over how users know what information is being collected, what is being done with the data, who can access it, where it\u2019s stored, and who owns it.

Why allow big data analytics physically into your body just so you can be part of a tech experiment?", "Despite these reservations, implants could conceivably be a useful innovation, particularly if the technology evolves so that the microchip can store more data. But only if they are completely controlled by the user, who would grant limited access to employers or third parties on a strictly need-to-know basis. To protect users, we would need a raft of legislation governing data ownership and security as well as an ecosystem involving trusted organizations such as the", " Mozilla Foundation", " or the", " Electronic Foundation Frontier", ", who could oversee and certify whether an employer\u2019s use of implant data conforms to regulations.", "As a one-off experiment, Epicenter\u2019s microchip implanting initiative has balls.

The costs of moving in this direction in terms of invasiveness, risk of incidental monitoring, and loss of control over our lives far outweighs any potential positives.

They were evangelizing the upcoming Pentium II, and they were looking to sign up companies that were willing to do code for that chip. Pentium II was a breakthrough chip for games. It had the AGP port and a lot of other gaming-friendly features on the chip. We signed up to do a rendering engine for the Pentium II. That\u2019s how we got into games. The guy showed us Shiny\u2019s old game, MDK, and said, \u201cLook at this, this is huge. You guys are doing multimedia and this is even better.\u201d That\u2019s how we signed up.

They would do things like matchmaking events, where they\u2019d showcase people like us to potential partners.", "GamesBeat: How did the games start growing for you?", "Rao:", " It took us a year to build our engine. We sustained the business with our pre-existing multimedia work. I traveled to E3 for the first time in 1997, in Atlanta, and realized how big the games business is. I came back and said, \u201cWe have to have something really awesome to show. This business is not about cost arbitrage. It\u2019s not about an Indian services company coming in and selling. You have to be really good at what you do.\u201d", "We took our time, and when we had a good demo, it was April of 1998. We used Intel\u2019s offices to set up a few meetings.

Here we were offering a software engine that was doing as good a job as the erstwhile hardware accelerated technology. That put us in a place where we could be high quality, but mass market.", "We got a call a few months later from Infogrames. They had a big Nintendo 64 game, Mission Impossible, and they were looking to make a PC version. Could we come over to France and see if we could do the job? That was the break, the first title we worked on. We signed up in November of 1998 and worked through all of 1999. The game was then cancelled at beta stage, but it was only cancelled because they had the Mission Impossible 2 license, and they didn\u2019t want an old licensed game to be coming out too close to the sequel.", "They gave us a good recommendation on the work that we\u2019d done, and we had a game to show. In March 2000 I was at GDC and I met people like Mitch Lasky and Ed Fries. I\u2019m showing this stuff on my laptop. It caught Ed Fries\u2019s interest and he put me on to people on his team.

The way that turned out, around the same time in 2000 and 2001, we ended up getting an inquiry out of the blue from Codemasters. They needed some cars made, and could we make them? So we did. I think it was in 2002 when we came to GDC and met up with Microsoft guys again. We showed them those cars and coincidentally, they had just greenlit the Forza franchise. The team, with Kiki Wolfkill and John Wendl, was looking for external companies to make those cars. The connection was made \u2013 hey, we just saw some good-looking cars, go check these guys out.", "They enlisted a lot of companies, and we did very well with that.

Market forces made it so that was the best opportunity for us. When we did the port for Mission Impossible, after that the aspiration as a team was to do another big game. We kept looking around, but those opportunities were very few and far between. Not very many willing people were willing to send a full game project to India.", "The guys at Infogrames were outliers in that sense. It was a decision made by one of their founders, the CTO of the company. Only he could have done that, to say, \u201cLet\u2019s give these guys a break.\u201d Subsequently he went on to become an investor in Dhruva at a personal level. He just liked us. You need some champions like that. But subsequent to that, especially when we\u2019d come to the U.S. and meet with other companies, they\u2019d say, \u201cIf you were here we could work with you.\u201d I remember meeting with some publishers who said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you guys relocate here? Then we could work with you.\u201d But that just wasn\u2019t what we wanted to do.", "More and more the business that came our way was pieces of the whole, and specifically lots of art. What we did is we kind of used our games team \u2013 people who were good at tech, who could make a full game \u2013 we got them on to product initiatives. Things we hoped could be that product that would crack the Indian market open. We thought that we could make compelling enough games to open up the Indian market. We were obviously very wrong, because it was very early for that. But we had a product initiative that coexisted with services for very many years. It was only in 2010 or 2011 that we finally bifurcated the two and had Game Tantra becoming a publisher.", "GamesBeat: The incubator for games?", "Rao:", " Right, Game Tantra subsequently became an incubator focused on the Indian market. Dhruva continued be a pure services provider, doing mainly art. We did try to grow a full services group for game development, for mobile, but that didn\u2019t really find good traction. We basically just doubled down and focused on art content creation and services. That\u2019s done very well for us.", "GamesBeat: How did you then see the Indian game industry growing up?", "Rao:", " We did a lot to try and seed the market, from PC-based multiplayer gaming in the early 2000s to mobile Java games in the mid-to-late 2000s. We tried doing downloadable PC and later smartphone games. But I guess in hindsight we were just plain too early. In a way we peaked too early, invested too early. We invested quite a lot. It was $2-3 million over a few years, which is a lot of money in India. It was all money coming out of the cash flow from our services business.

The Yellen Fed is on the precipice of making the same mistake the Greenspan Fed did when it tried to control capital market prices by increasing rates. Greenspan had the dot-com bubble of the \u201990s that he wanted to address. Remember when eyeballs on websites were more important than corporate earnings, and companies changed their name to ", "whatever", ".com just so they could raise capital? Today, we have the Trump stock rally.", "It doesn\u2019t seem to matter what line of business your company is in \u2014 if you have investors, your investors are betting on growth. Love him or hate him, investors view the expected Trump policies to be good for business and good for growth. The stock market is all the evidence you need. Post-election the DOW experienced two records: hitting 20,000 for the first time, then shortly thereafter 21,000.", "During the dot-com bubble, investors assumed eyeballs would turn into earnings; they didn\u2019t. The Trump rally assumes reduced regulation, lower taxes, and less red-tape will result in growth. It could, but then again it might not. The truth is we have no idea what the impact will be. Because we don\u2019t have enough information about the new administration\u2019s economic and other policies to gauge how the economy will be impacted, it\u2019s dangerous to assume the impact. To make such an assumption is really a \u201chope\u201d trade; not unlike the eyeball assumption of the late \u201990s. Today\u2019s investors believe the business environment will improve to such an extent that increased growth is inevitable.", "The problem is that the Fed seems to have become completely distracted with the huge run-up in capital market values (just as in the \u201990s). However, today\u2019s economy has been on a slow burn recovery for the last six+ years. Unemployment and non-farm payrolls have been improving, and GDP, while anemic, has been positive. Nothing points to a material departure from this in 2017 other than the \u201chope\u201d trade we see in the capital markets. I think we can all acknowledge the Fed needs to raise rates to get back to \u201cnormal,\u201d but a slow, deliberate pace is still best given the latent fragility in the economy. This talk of at least three hikes is concerning. As many as two rate hikes could possibly be rationalized in 2017. However, they should both take place towards the end of the year, when we have better visibility and a deeper understanding of the new administration\u2019s economic policies. One economist theorized that the only reason the Fed is contemplating a hike is because nothing else has gone wrong in the economy.", "I agree, a slow burn recovery remains the status quo for 2017, leading to a natural conclusion that a slow pace of increasing rates (as we experienced in 2015 and 2016) would be the most prudent course of action. Against this backdrop, if the Fed proceeds with a materially more aggressive rate hike posture, it runs the risk of slowing the economy along multiple vectors: employment, business investment, GDP, and trade \u2014 harming the economy, not protecting it from inflation. In the \u201990s during the dot-com bubble, the Fed thought it could control the irrational exuberance by raising rates and therefore driving down dot-com stock prices. The Fed was wrong. It weakened the economy \u2014 and when the dot-com bubble did burst, the recession was much worse. Ultimately, it\u2019s difficult for a rational action to adequately address an irrational problem. Not dissimilar, today\u2019s Fed believes capital markets are overvalued and is using this fact as 1) additional support to increase rates; and 2) as a means to control valuations. If it was to raise rates, the move would be even less successful than it was back in the \u201990s, as investors would likely interpret a March rate hike as supporting their notion of expansive economic growth being inevitable.", "While accelerated growth is possible if the right economic policies are enacted, it\u2019s too soon to make this assumption. Current economic trends do not support this notion, as the slow burn recovery continues. Just as with the dot-com bubble in the \u201990s, at some point, investors will realize their \u201chope\u201d trade is exactly that \u2014 \u201chope,\u201d and the market will pull back. And, if the Fed has increased rates once or twice before the pullback occurs, the economy will have already been substantially weakened, combining the psychologies of weak economic stats and retreating capital markets and possibly setting the stage for a dot-bomb-like recession.", "If the Fed were to ask me for advice (and it has not), I would urge it to wait to make a hike decision until the third quarter. At that point, we will have a much better idea of new economic policy and the timing of such. With the slow burn recovery in place, the risk of inflation remains low if the Fed moves late, but if it moves too quickly the threat of recession and its severity are materially increased.", "Todd Harris is President and CEO of Silicon Valley-based credit union ", "Tech CU", "."]}

Our speakers were Greg Castle of ", "Anorak Ventures", " and Tipatat Chennavasin of ", "The Venture Reality Fund", ". Nelson Rodriguez of Akamai introduced us, noting that the aim was to get to strategies that could benefit everyone.", "Castle was one of the early investors in Oculus VR, before it was acquired by Facebook in 2014 for nearly $3 billion. He formed his own fund to invest in VR and other fast-growing tech markets, and he has made 33 investments so far. Chennavasin said he has met with more than 1,800 startups in the past year, and he logs them in his chart that maps out the VR industry below.", "Here\u2019s an edited transcript of our conversation.", "Above: The VR Fund\u2019s 2016 VR industry landscape.", "GB: Everybody here knows that the VR launches didn\u2019t quite go as well as everybody predicted. Digi Capital predicted that AR and VR would be $150 billion in revenue by 2020. That was probably the first prediction. Now the forecast is for $108 billion in 2021. It\u2019s been shaved back twice. Everybody expected that to happen. That\u2019s a starting point. Now, what do you do in a market that\u2019s slower to take off than expected?", "Greg Castle:", " In my previous life I was an entrepreneur in a totally unrelated field. I was in the restaurant business. Then, from 2010 forward, I was in the video game business, always on the tools side. I worked for a small company called Scaleform that was bought by AutoDesk. Then I worked for AutoDesk for a couple of years in their technology group \u2013 MAX, Maya, and a bunch of realtime tools.", "I started to get involved in the startup scene. A couple of very close friends of mine founded Oculus. Those were also the founders of Scaleform, the first company I worked for. I had a great opportunity to invest in Oculus. Financially it worked out very well, but more interesting for me was being in at the ground floor. There was an initial meeting between myself, Palmer Luckey, Brendan Iribe, Nate, Michael, in a restaurant a lot like this, where we all met Palmer for the first time. What started as a dinner amongst friends has essentially spawned this whole new industry. Being on that journey, having a front row seat to everything that\u2019s happened, has been far more valuable than the financial rewards from Oculus.", "Above: The Vive and Oculus Rift systems.", "Since Facebook bought Oculus I\u2019ve focused full time on investing. I now have my own fund, a small fund that focuses on emerging technology. Not just VR and AR, but also robotics and autonomous vehicles and computer vision and sharks with lasers on their heads and a bunch of other cool shit. That\u2019s where I am today. I\u2019ve made about 33 investments now. A third are in VR and AR and the rest are in tangential fields. I\u2019m happy to be here today.", "It\u2019s worth pointing out the difference between people who weren\u2019t in the industry, weren\u2019t in the know, and their thoughts on VR, versus those of us who\u2019ve been in it all along. Everyone who\u2019s been in it all along has known there was going be this trough of disillusion. We all knew it was coming. Now it\u2019s more a question of managing expectations. You have other people seeing sales figures that aren\u2019t as impressive as they thought they would be, but again, those of us in the know knew this was going to be a slow build.", "As a result, my advice has always been that this is going to be a long road. Raise more than you think you\u2019ll need. Manage your burn as closely as possible. It\u2019s easy to get caught up in the hype that\u2019s going on now. It\u2019s easy to take some of this money that\u2019s being thrown at VR companies, although maybe a little less so just now. But that hype is still just hype. These people are not concentrating on a sustainable long-term business when this money is coming in. Be cautious. Know that when it comes to the VR industry, you guys probably know a lot more than any of the investors that you\u2019re talking to. Manage accordingly.", "Tipatat Chennavasin:", " I\u2019m co-founder and general partner of the Venture Reality Fund. We\u2019re a $50 million fund focused on VR and AR. My background comes from the interactive space. I\u2019ve been an artist and designer. I\u2019ve owned mobile game startups. I was in social games, which was terrible. But I\u2019m from the indie game scene.", "Right now in VR is the best time for indies. It\u2019s the most exciting time. It\u2019s very early. Everyone knew\u2014there\u2019s a lot of talk about how VR isn\u2019t doing as well as we hoped. If the PSVR was gathering dust on shelves, that would be a disturbing scene. But it\u2019s been sold out since December. Sony said they\u2019ve done a million. They\u2019ll have more ready in April. It\u2019s going well.", "I was at a conference run by a consumer insights company. They do a lot of consulting for the media industry, and they were trying to understand VR and consumer behavior around VR. They found that the people who got VR over the holidays, their satisfaction was through the roof. This was across the board. Even terrible Cardboard VR. The excitement and enthusiasm\u2014we\u2019ve all demo\u2019d VR to people and seen how they respond to it.", "The most interesting thing is, when we look at what VR is doing, it\u2019s not just about hardware sales. How are software companies doing? How is the ecosystem doing? I look at the Wii. It was a great product for Nintendo, but it was a shitty game platform for any third-party developer. With the Vive we\u2019re seeing very much the opposite. Small initial sales, maybe 500K, but against the Vive at least nine software titles have generated more than a million dollars in consumer revenue. This isn\u2019t just support from the platforms.", "You\u2019re not going to make a $5 million game and get $30 million back yet. But if you\u2019re a smart indie studio and you\u2019re doing a $300K-$500K game, you can be profitable within a year. We\u2019ve seen that happen with many teams. We have to walk before we run. The signs are positive.", "What\u2019s also great\u2014when we were first looking at VR, everyone was looking at VCs for funding. For the games industry, that\u2019s a terrible idea. You have to get that platform money and raise those publishing deals. When Oculus goes up on stage and says, \u201cWe\u2019ve spent $250 million to fund VR projects in the last two years,\u201d that\u2019s amazing. And they\u2019re going to do another $250 million, which is even better. Then we have people like IMAX doing VR arcades. They have a fund of I think $50 million. We\u2019re seeing people stepping up to fund content, which we haven\u2019t seen happen in the industry in a long time.", "If you talk to VCs, they\u2019ll say something like, \u201cWell, once you\u2019ve got your publishing deal, come talk to us and we\u2019ll help you fund your company.\u201d Funding content is not what a tech VC is good for. But we\u2019re seeing a lot of money from Google, from HTC, from others. Right now is the best time for indies."]}

Its success enabled Owlchemy to be one of the few early examples of how to succeed\u00a0in VR game development.", "I talked with Alex Schwartz, CEO of Owlchemy Labs, the creator of Job Simulator for the HTC Vive and other VR platforms.

We announced our revenue, that we\u2019ve surpassed $3 million in sales for Job Simulator last year. We\u2019re seeing incredible pickup from people who have the ability to show a performance of themselves inside the game \u2013 YouTubers, Twitch streamers, Facebook Live, things like that.", "People didn\u2019t expect how much of a spectator sport VR would be. That was one of our early decisions when we were building. We thought that owners of year one VR hardware \u2014 PlayStation VR, Vive, Oculus \u2013 would not be the primary users of the hardware. It would be passing it off to friends and family. VR parties where people come over because they\u2019re rare in the early days, in the relative scheme of things. We tried to build a game where you didn\u2019t have to give a whole backstory about how to use it, what the controls are. You could just hand it to a friend and say, \u201cGo nuts.\u201d They can get the story through the world-building, the environmental storytelling. They don\u2019t have to learn a lot to get into it.", "We\u2019ve been getting a bunch of awards. Obviously we had the DICE nomination. The Unity awards, Sundance. There\u2019s been quite a few. It\u2019s been awesome to see. It\u2019s funny. It starts off when you tell people the name and the concept. There\u2019s this expectation mismatch between that point \u2013 \u201cWait, why do I just want to do a job?\u201d \u2013 and then when you play it and come out and realize it\u2019s a ton of fun. It was a fun uphill battle in a sense. If you offer something with guns or going into space, that makes sense in the early days of VR. \u201cI want to go to a fantastic world!\u201d People don\u2019t normally think it would be fun to throw a stapler or eat a donut, but it turned out that everyone seems to love it.", "GB: You made some choices, knowing what would happen with VR in year one.

It was more, \u201cWhat is the use case in year one?\u201d It\u2019s not a 40-hour game where you\u2019re going to continuously explore a story and pick it up over several sessions. A more mature platform would have that gameplay loop. We wanted that pass and play, instant pickup, smooth onboarding, family friendly, focus on the highest quality graphics. We wanted an art style that\u2019s not too demanding on the GPU, so we could push it up in resolution to get nice crisp edges.", "Our predictions were that, for the units that were out there, they\u2019d get a lot of use on a per-person basis. It wouldn\u2019t just be \u201cmy\u201d headset. It would belong to everyone in my circles of friends and family.

It was the first Vive development kit that\u2014six months before the Vive was announced, we got this early unit. We\u2019d seen room scale and seen hand interaction. It was like, let\u2019s erase everything we knew about game development and game design, all our expectations, and start over. What\u2019s fun about room scale and hands? That\u2019s where Job Simulator emerged.", "We grew to 22 full-time people through the course of developing Job Simulator, and now Rick and Morty.

Some of the decisions that led to the final output, that story of\u2014we almost couldn\u2019t get that piece of hardware, the Vive, because of certain situations. It\u2019s a long story. But my co-founder, his wife was pregnant, and she couldn\u2019t leave. He was up in Canada. It was one of those things where Valve has built one of these devices, and it\u2019s got wires hanging off it. If you drop it, game over. Job Simulator wouldn\u2019t have existed if we accidentally dropped that headset. But we went up there to build the prototype in a weekend. That whole story shows how we went from this very small team to what\u2019s now one of the largest companies doing only VR.", "GB: The $3 million, does that mean the game is profitable? Did you break even, at least?", "Schwartz:", " It\u2019s hard to measure. A lot of people would say it was successful. Even at a much lower revenue target, it would have been successful, because it opened the door to being a launch title on PSVR and Oculus, being a pack-in on the Vive. The amount of notoriety and influence and all that, that was way more than\u2014as long as we didn\u2019t go out of business, it would have been a success.", "There\u2019s a couple of numbers out there. Survios released some numbers. We released some numbers. Those are pinning various data points to the overall VR ecosystem. Everyone\u2019s wondering if we can make enough money. Is it big enough? Can anything succeed here? I think absolutely it\u2019s a world where, if you set expectations properly, you can find success in a lot of places. But some people are asking that question in the grand sense of, \u201cCan I put $100 million into development today and get a 2X return from a great game?\u201d We\u2019re not at the stage where this medium allows for that size of game.", "We\u2019re happy with our attach rates. Everyone\u2019s manufacturer bound.

It turned out that\u2014we bring on a lot of people at the company that are\u2014communication is our number one job interview requirement. A lot of people are really well-spoken about VR. Our audio guy, for example, is giving a talk about spatial 3D audio with HRTF. Our producer, who\u2019s on Rick and Morty, she\u2019s giving a design talk on that project. We ended up bringing together a whole group of people who can speak eloquently about VR, and that led to a lot of talks in all the disciplines where we\u2019ve been building.", "We even put together a funny talk about \u201chow not to give a VR demo,\u201d because we\u2019ve seen so many terrible demos. Someone has a headset on and you just throw a bunch of controllers at them, all these failings.", "GB: What\u2019s the timing on Rick and Morty at this point?", "Schwartz:", " We haven\u2019t made any announcements yet on launch timing. We\u2019ve announced that it\u2019s coming to the Vive, and nothing further. You can expect some more announcements soon. Justin Roiland is keynoting VR LA in two months. We\u2019re working closely with him, since he does both the voices for Rick and Morty. He\u2019s made a lot of contributions on the audio side of the game.", "GB: How did you find that project? Or did it find you?", "Schwartz:", " That\u2019s a funny origin story. He tweeted, \u201cI love Job Simulator!\u201d He\u2019s a little crazy. He\u2019s screaming in all caps about how he loves the game. \u201cWHO MADE THIS? OH MY GOD IT\u2019S SO GOOD!\u201d I replied and said, \u201cHey, you make one of my favorite TV shows.\u201d I was in LA a couple of weeks later and we messaged back and forth. I ended up at his house drinking beers and ordering takeout Indian food. We were just hanging out.", "My plan was to pitch him. \u201cHey, we should combine the concepts of the cartoon you made and Job Simulator. What if it were Job Simulator in Rick\u2019s garage?\u201d But before I could pitch him, he was saying, \u201cWe should do this!\u201d Basically parroting back my idea. A week later we found ourselves giving demos of VR to the head of Adult Swim. At that point it was done. We started development right away.", "We\u2019ve been working on it about a year now. A lot of challenges with having fully rigged 3D animated characters that have never been shown in 3D before, standing in front of you in VR. It\u2019s like the challenge when the first Simpsons games were made, with 3D Homer and so on. No one had ever actualized him in three dimensions. We did all the work to take a 2D character and make it into 3D animation.", "We\u2019re giving a GDC talk about that, too, called \u201cSpatial Storytelling.\u201d We have to tell a story in 3D now. You don\u2019t necessarily know where the player\u2019s looking, whether they\u2019re listening. Are they paying attention to the V/O or not? There are lots of tips about how we\u2019ve found that you can\u2019t just force the player to do something. You don\u2019t want to make them feel bad if they\u2019re not following the rules of the world right at any moment. It\u2019s still a sandbox. You can still do what you want. But there\u2019s a story overarching it.", "GB: Compared to that, Job Simulator was what, about four people over 16 months?", "Schwartz:", " Job Simulator started with four people and grew to 16 over the course of about 16 months. That was the whole development cycle. Between launch on the Vive at about 16 people \u2013 that was maybe 10 months ago \u2013 and now, we grew to 22 people. Meanwhile we\u2019ve been doing Rick and Morty, experimenting with new projects, porting Job Simulator to PSVR and Oculus Touch.", "GB: So it\u2019s a bit more expensive, but it\u2019s not out of control.", "Schwartz:", " It wasn\u2019t the entire team, I\u2019d say. The budget on Rick and Morty is about 1.25 time that of Job Simulator. We learned a lot of lessons that we could apply directly. But then there\u2019s the whole\u2014we\u2019ve never dealt with real 3D characters. We had floating robots. That was a nice way to save on skinning and rigging and animating.", "Above: Job Simulator for PlayStation VR.", "GB: Is humor becoming your niche, maybe?", "Schwartz:", " Let me step back. Tim Schafer is one of the key people who\u2019s made humor in games live on. There were a lot of adventure games back in the day that had humor built in. Now very few games have a lot of humor in them. We\u2019ve set out, as a goal, to try and not take ourselves too seriously in all the games we make. If you look back at the first four games we made before VR, and then take a look at what we did with Job Simulator and Rick and Morty, humor\u2019s been a vein that runs through all of them. That\u2019s important.", "VR specifically pulls out the childlike nature in people. Even the most suit-and-tie businessman we get, some partner who comes by to try VR, they go into Job Simulator and within seconds the inhibitions go away. Maybe it\u2019s because you\u2019re in your own world a bit. You forget about all the people around you. Or you feel like you\u2019re becoming another character. Some psychological elements lead to people reverting to a childlike state of mind.", "I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s that you forget that people are watching, or that you remember they\u2019re there, so you kind of embellish and laugh at yourself. There\u2019s a lot of factors that lead into extracting silliness from people. The funny thing is, no matter how serious you make a game\u2014you\u2019ve played Gallery, by Cloudhead Games? That\u2019s a very serious adventure game. But the thing is, the first time you get a key in your hand in that game, the first thing you want to do is throw it right out the window. It\u2019s the most important thing, the thing you need to progress in the game, but because you have hands, people want to be silly.", "We\u2019ve found that you almost have to take extra effort to stop people from being silly in VR. If we build something that allows them to be creative, though, we can play into that.", "GB: It seems like most companies are afraid of humor. There isn\u2019t very much of it in games.", "Schwartz:", " It\u2019s hard to do right. I can\u2019t claim that we always do it right. Humor is sometimes in the eye of the beholder. Some jokes land well and some don\u2019t. It\u2019s definitely a risk. If you\u2019re doing something serious, you\u2019re not waiting for something to work or not work. If it\u2019s humor, you have to land the jokes. It\u2019s like standup. You can bomb hard, just like on stage doing standup.", "All the environments started with Simpsons references, Mike Judge humor. The original Office demo had the \u201ccome in on Saturday\u201d joke from Office Space. Setting that tone helped us write the right lines. That\u2019s something interesting. People come up to me and ask, \u201cWho\u2019s your writer? They\u2019re great!\u201d But we don\u2019t have a writer at Owlchemy.", "We built a premise around our initial gameplay prototype \u2013 \u201cin the future, robots have taken all your jobs.\u201d Now you\u2019re in this re-creation where robots did bad research on how everything was supposed to be. It\u2019s all slightly off. Every person on the team, whether they\u2019re an artist or a designer, they have to think, \u201cWhen I\u2019m designing a keyboard for a computer in the office, designing a blender in the kitchen, how would that work in this skewed weird future where robots reinvented everything?\u201d You have to understand the premise and have a sense of humor.", "That\u2019s another thing we hire for. We have to have people who are all on the same page with that sense of humor, so we can all play into it rather than having one single writer try to write lines. Because it\u2019s not lines that are funny, it\u2019s the whole environment. It\u2019s the things on the poster, the design and shape of everything in the world, it all plays into that story.", "GB: Thinking about the outlook for VR, what are the stages you see ahead? People are talking about this \u201ctrough of disillusion.\u201d", "Schwartz:", " We\u2019ve always believed we should run our company understanding that there will be a longer period than analysts predict before we get to a number of consumer units out there that you could arbitrarily define as \u201ca ton.\u201d When we started developing Job Simulator, we thought, \u201cLet\u2019s look at the timelines of how things are starting to get released.\u201d Gear VR released numbers very early saying they had the most units out. Before the Vive had been announced, the Rift was the only game in town, that and this idea of some kind of prototype from Sony. That was where we were when we were making design decisions.", "We said, \u201cThe standard for all VR interaction is going to be two hands and one head. All three will be positionally tracked.\u201d So we didn\u2019t build any games that were just gaze-based, with no positional tracking. We shot ahead of the curve, hoping that Sony would release Move controllers, hoping that Oculus would eventually release hand controllers. But it was a huge risk. We had to start before anyone announced hand controllers would be a thing. It turned out to be the right decision.", "People told us, in the early days, \u201cYou\u2019re building for a far-out future. That\u2019s not going to be the case. Rift will have an Xbox controller. You should build for that.\u201d We decided to take the risk and go for hand interaction, because that\u2019s the compelling future. 10 years from now, we\u2019ll still have direct hand manipulation. You\u2019ll still be able to reach out and pick up a soda or whatever. When we got our numbers back from PlayStation, we were number one for all of 2016. It was Job Simulator in the lead, and then Batman. The commonality between those is that they\u2019re the only games that used standing and motion controls. Everyone else used Dual Shock as the primary input.", "We had been campaigning to Sony and Oculus and Valve \u2013 \u201cHands! Hands! Hands!\u201d It was questionable. People were arguing that the audience would just want to sit down on the couch and play. But we finally got the numbers that proved it out. People want to be in the content, directly manipulating things.", "That meant we were targeting a subset of the market. You don\u2019t have a 100 percent attach on Moves with PlayStation or Touch with Oculus. Vive ships with controllers. But that\u2019s the marketplace.", "Above: Valve\u2019s Job Simulator.", "GB: Are you hoping that Nintendo will have some kind of VR entry?", "Schwartz:", " From an art style standpoint, we definitely adopt\u2014Mario has an amazing visual style that\u2019s never gone out of date. We take that concept to heart. So absolutely.", "I get this question a lot \u2013 \u201cWho will win the VR war?\u201d I think that\u2019s the wrong way to look at it. I don\u2019t think there will be some clash and then one platform will emerge. It will be fragmented, in a good sense, like the Android market. You\u2019ll have a lot of different players. For developers, as long as you\u2019re multiplatform, you have a big win there, because you don\u2019t have to put all your eggs in one basket. We didn\u2019t do an exclusive because we knew the long term for us was making great relationships with Sony, Oculus, and Valve. And then opening the door to however many other platforms.", "If Nintendo does something, if Apple does something, who knows? We\u2019ll be ready on an engine that allows us to go to those platforms, with games that we think hit the baseline of quality interaction. Head, hands, positional tracking.", "GB: Were you sensitive to the sort of hyper-awareness of users who don\u2019t want exclusives? In the console days exclusives weren\u2019t viewed as a bad thing. They were expected. But in a more PC-like world, it almost seems like there\u2019s a negative reaction to anybody who would think of doing anything exclusive. Even that exclusive level in Arizona Sunshine drew criticism.", "Schwartz:", " That one was a particularly strange case, because of how\u2014people perceived it as, well, it\u2019s still a PC, but it\u2019s an i5 versus an i7, which seems like such a small difference. There were some complaints like, \u201cI have a PC that could run it, so why don\u2019t you let me?\u201d But when people talk about exclusives\u2013I\u2019ve never felt like, \u201cOh, I dislike this developer for doing a platform exclusive.\u201d In the earliest of days exclusives are the way you can get high quality content paid for up front in a market that couldn\u2019t yet sustain the sales that would otherwise support a quality game like that. Halo couldn\u2019t have gotten made unless Microsoft jumped in to get something for day one on the Xbox. I never felt anything negative about that concept. You need great software to sell hardware. That\u2019s how it\u2019s always been.", "But for us, we decided\u2014not because we were against the concept, but because we thought it would be a good long play to have all partners on board, we started thinking of ourselves as this Switzerland of VR. Kind of like Unity is. Unity works with every piece of hardware. We wanted Owlchemy\u2019s brand to be associated with the best VR content.", "Let\u2019s say it\u2019s even across all three platforms, 33 percent each for Oculus, PSVR, and Vive. If you go exclusive, that means you\u2019re getting a smaller fraction. To fit our goal of having the most people boot up their VR headset and see an Owlchemy logo, it was clear for us that going multiplatform was a better way to do it. It was just at a cost of asking, \u201cWell, can we do that without going out of business?\u201d In those earliest days, in 2014 and 2015, we didn\u2019t even know the price points of the headsets. We didn\u2019t know when they\u2019d be launching. Any financial advisor would have told us, \u201cWhat you\u2019re doing is dumb.\u201d But we took that bet and said, \u201cNo, this is going to be a successful market. We want to be there.\u201d", "GB: Did you cook up any advice for people who would ask you how to survive the next year or two in VR?", "Schwartz:", " In a talk I gave back in 2012, which was called \u201cNot Going Out of Business as an Indie,\u201d we talked about how our oldest strategy from the beginning of Owlchemy was that\u2014we used to spend six months of the year on contract work to bootstrap the company. We tried to make it so those six months would give us 12 months of runway. Then we\u2019d have a very defined, \u201cOkay, we have six months to do original IP,\u201d trying to ship smaller, shorter games in that period. Then we\u2019d try to do that cycle again, with the hopes that we could eventually make enough money on our own work to not have to do those contracts.", "That\u2019s how it worked out. The first two years we did that cycle twice. Then after that we did all original stuff, because we\u2019d gotten over the threshold. We were bringing in some drip income across six, seven, eight platforms. We put games out everywhere and we hoped. That worked out in the sense that if we didn\u2019t have a multiplatform strategy and do some contract work, wheeling and dealing for up-front money from various platforms\u2014all of that contributed to having four people able to get by.", "If you bring together five people in a room today and say, \u201cLet\u2019s start a VR company tomorrow,\u201d and then you think about normal industry salaries and the time it takes to build your first game\u2014there\u2019s no way, unless you\u2019re independently wealthy. You\u2019d have to raise money via an angel round, or have an amazing pedigree to be able to go to some VCs and say, \u201cHey, this is going to be a big win because we\u2019re the team that built X.\u201d A lot of people on the younger side, where VR is maybe the first big platform they want to build for\u2013starting a company like we did, bootstrapping was a great way to get by in the early days.", "The other thing is, a lot of founders out of college make a lot of mistakes with their companies. They don\u2019t know what works and what doesn\u2019t in the ecosystem. I recommend that people work at a studio for a year or two to get the concepts of what does and doesn\u2019t work in various production environments. I feel like I learned a ton in the first two years, working in triple-A. I then promptly quit and started my own company, but that experience was invaluable. I feel like I would have failed if I\u2019d just gone from school to startup. There are so many things I learned how to do and how not to do. The triple-A company wasn\u2019t very successful. I learned a lot about what not to do. [laughs] But that\u2019s a big tip I tell people, to get that experience.", "GB: One of the big arguments Jason Rubin was making in his talk here was that the platform companies will make a lot of developers succeed because they\u2019re seeding the ecosystem.

It was either up-front guarantees, advances, or money from our previous games on Steam that were not VR. And then we raised the $5 million from Qualcomm Ventures and HTC. There was money made to make VR games, and then there was actual consumer revenue. We\u2019ve seen that slice grow as we had hoped. We could stay successful, but never sell a unit. That wouldn\u2019t be a success in my mind.", "Above: Mixed reality is a key way to sell people on VR.", "GB: Like the developers in Canada that get government money.", "Schwartz:", " Exactly. When they set up those programs, their goal was, economically, if you kickstart them on year one they won\u2019t need an infusion by year two. They\u2019re all on consumer sales. We\u2019re trying to get to a point where we got a nice push from all the previous things we did, all the partnerships we had, and now we\u2019re hoping the lion\u2019s share comes from sales to consumers. We\u2019re getting to a point where there are enough units out there to pull in a good amount.", "GB: It looks like you have a viable path to follow now.", "Schwartz:", " Absolutely. Like I mentioned, it\u2019s definitely viable. Your expectations need to be in line with the year we\u2019re at. Can we put $100 million into a game now? Very low chance of that. But if you\u2019re setting your development time and budgets in accordance with where growth will be at the time of launch\u2014I think this is exceeding our expectations. When you look at tech over the past 30 years, the first VCR\u2014like, what was the sales curve for something that was ultimately so successful? The first units were thousands of dollars. In the first year they sold a couple thousand of them.", "Comparing VR numbers with iPhone numbers, they\u2019re very close as far as takeup. That\u2019s a crazy comparison, because there were six or seven years of pre-iPhone devices to seed the market for that type of device. The iPhone was a big polished effort in that field. We haven\u2019t had even the unpolished efforts in VR yet. This is the first thing, if you don\u2019t count academic experiments in the \u201890s. You\u2019d expect it to match something brand new and revolutionary like the VCR, and we\u2019re blowing those away.", "It\u2019s not an incremental next step. It\u2019s the start of a new thing. That\u2019s where expectations get mismatched. I think it\u2019s going fantastically when you think about where we are in a 40-year curve. This is still just year one-and-a-half. All my friends who are not in tech have still heard of VR. Their kids want it for their birthdays. It\u2019s definitely exceeded where I thought we would be in year one."]}

LocusLabs has       employed unique technology and expertise to tackle the problem. CEO and       Co-Founder, Campbell Kennedy, led the startup team that developed the       original Google Street View technology, and he\u2019s brought a similar       approach to LocusLabs for large indoor spaces. \u201cTraditional mapping       platforms like Google Maps do not address needs of everything going on       inside venues and buildings. Indoor spaces are more about \u2018things\u2019 than       places. LocusLabs brings indoor location down to the \u2018things\u2019 level,\u201d       said Kennedy.    ", "      LocusLabs\u2019 technology stack is made up of a reality capture system       consisting of depth cameras, lasers and other sensors which produces       interior maps of buildings and builds out a database of thousands of       places, products and things. This system enables LocusLabs to produce a       highly-detailed 3D map of a large venue in a matter of days. The map is       used to deploy indoor positioning technology to augment GPS, and       camera-based tools running on a smartphone are then used to keep all the       map content up-to-date.    ", "      LocusLabs started off by tackling airports, the largest and most heavily       foot-trafficked indoor spaces on earth. With 2.3 billion passengers       passing through the top 50 airports worldwide, the need and opportunity       is huge for airports and airlines to contextualize the traveler       experience, drive engagement and increase brand loyalty through mobile.

But with increasing       investment and complexity of technology being deployed in large       buildings, there is also a major need for B2B applications,\u201d says       Kennedy. For example, Miami International Airport is looking to location       as a way to optimize their airport by monitoring where people spend       their time inside the terminals so they can reduce air conditioning       costs where it\u2019s not needed, which can save millions of dollars per       year.

We have, I would say, a personal point of view on this conflict, especially Normandy. That\u2019s what we want to show you, on a skirmish map.\u201d", "Steel Division\u00a0runs on Eugen\u2019s in-house game engine, Iriszoom. It has single-player skirmish modes and a campaign, and it offers up to 10-vs.-10 multiplayer. It has more than 400 units from the U.S., English, Polish, French, and German armies (and others, too). You control small squads of infantry, Jeeps and tanks (both light scouts and heavy tank-killers), distinct cannons, call in air strikes, and even summon the big naval guns from vessels off the beach.", "One of Eugen\u2019s innovations here is how combat takes place in three phases \u2014 A, B, and C. You spend activation points to acquire units. Say you pick a recon patrols with a jeep and a .30 caliber machine gun with an A on it. This means you can place it on the first phase. Those with a B come in the second phase, showing that they are slower and take more time to arrive. So the genius here also gives value to weaker units like scout tanks \u2014 these wouldn\u2019t last long if they rolled out with heavier armor, so those come in the B and C phases, while the scouts come in the A portion of battle.", "\u201cWhy would you use a super light tank in a game that has Tiger tanks? They were used in a war, but in a game, why would you use it?\u201d Le Dressay said. \u201cThis is our answer, because it\u2019s the only tank you have in phase A.\u201d", "Once your forces tangle with the enemy, you can watch the front move as your forces take control of new turf or fall back when a heavy tank rumbles into your territory. Units also react to conditions with a stress mechanic \u2014 the higher this meter goes, the more likely they are to miss their targets, fall back, or even rout.", "\u201cThe tank will retreat, while infantry in that case will get pinned down,\u201d Le Dressay said. \u201cThey can\u2019t move, unless you order them to withdraw. If they get too close to the enemy in that state, they\u2019ll surrender.\u201d", "Which means you can win an engagement without having to wipe out the enemy \u2014 and in many wargames, you end up destroying your foe too often to achieve your objectives. You don\u2019t have to kill everybody.", "\u201cIt\u2019s about conquest, taking control of the map. You don\u2019t technically have to kill everyone, although obviously it will happen,\u201d Le Dressay said. \u201cIt\u2019s about taking control of the map and forcing the enemy back. Once they can\u2019t deploy more units, what are they going to do?\u201d", "The personal viewpoint comes from a few aspects. The easy part comes from control: You\u2019re guiding\u00a0small groups of soldiers and sometimes putting them right behind trees and even hedgerows. But Eugen says that he and his coworkers at Eugen had other reasons for making this game.", "\u201cI wanted to do Normandy because I know the place. In fact, what I wanted to create was something where you\u2019re in the map, and you have the most authentic map, where it\u2019s exactly what it is in reality,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes, when I play a game, it doesn\u2019t look [right]\u2014what I can provide is that I know Normandy, and so I know this is how it is. We had photographic reference. Players that like World War II and like Normandy, they have the assurance that this is very accurate. I wanted to provide this for the first time.", "\u201cWhen you try to create a franchise, you have to raise expectations. The first game you do is maybe the most difficult one, because you have to project yourself. \u2018This is how the game is going to work.\u2019 In the beginning you have more intuition than concrete know-how. That\u2019s why I chose Normandy. It\u2019s also interesting because you have a lot of very interesting, very famous divisions there \u2013 U.S., English, Polish, French.\u201d", "It\u2019s also personal because he had relatives in World War II, such as an uncle fighting in an armored unit in North Africa and a member of the\u00a0French resistance in Normandy. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much he helped the invasion,\u201d he said.", "Country required", "*By checking this box, you are confirming you are an adult 18 years or older and you agree to Intel contacting you with marketing-related emails or by telephone.

For example, transaction processing is different via voice than it is via typing and clicking. Advertisers may find themselves adapting their systems to enable transaction processing in a new format. This also raises issues about ad attribution. Advertisers will have to navigate the new reality inherent in this medium: Ad inventory is singular with only one advertiser per impression. This is likely to result in a higher cost per impression.", "Advertisers with low ROIs on ad spend may be forced to innovate or be forced out. The offsetting opportunity is the elimination of competition and (presumably) higher response rates. This, of course, is all predicated on the assumption that consumers will be responsive to ads in this context.", "Consumers will need to decide if, and at what point, they find this type of advertising intrusive and distracting as opposed to helpful. Consumers may tolerate the subtler preferred partner approach and may even find it adds value, but they may quickly get tired of more blatant forms of ads. I suspect that once the novelty wears off, the annoyance threshold will decline, which could lead to an increase in the number of premium, ad-free subscriptions. If I\u2019m listening to the free, ad-supported version of Spotify on my free, ad-supported version of Echo and I have to endure not only the ads from Spotify but also the ads from my voice-enabled assistant, I may be whipping out my credit card sooner rather than later.", "Phil Nadel is cofounder and Managing Director of ", "Barbara Corcoran Venture Partners", ", an AngelList syndicate.

And the second stage was the mobile era, starting around 2010, [which is] when Xiaomi sold smartphones. We think around three years ago was when the third era occurred, which is the IoT era,\u201d Sung explained. \u201cIn many ways, Xiaomi saw this opportunity earlier than competitors. We saw a whole host of IoT startups rise up in 2014, but Xiaomi was prepared in 2013. We foresaw a future where not only your computer or smartphone would be connected, but other devices, like televisions, air purifiers, etc. would be as well. We use an interesting method to tackle the ecosystem: Our entire team is filled with former engineers of Xiaomi turned investors.\u201d", "Sung said that Mi Home is the first company product many customers will interact with, and it showcases the potential of Xiaomi.

We let our ecosystem companies build them. For each particular product category, we pick a company that we think is going to be a winner and invest in it. We provide them everything, not just funding, but help them with distribution, give them the Mi brand, sell them in our stores, help them raise money, and help hire experienced managers. In most cases, we don\u2019t take a lot of equity \u2014 15 to 25 percent \u2014 making them feel they have a large ownership of their company.\u201d", "Although Sung touts the success of Xiaomi\u2019s incubation program, should expansion to the U.S. occur, Mi Home likely won\u2019t be the thing that Americans will be exposed to first. It will be the phones. Xiaomi\u2019s 50 million connected devices are tailored to the Asian markets, so it doesn\u2019t necessarily make sense to bring them into the U.S. The next logical step would be to introduce the phones, but even that is fraught with difficulty because of the extensive competition and other struggles that Xiaomi faces.", "Above: Xiaomi VP Hugo Barra at the Consumer Electronics Show in 2017 highlighting that the company now incubates 77 hardware companies in China.", "In January, the company announced it would ", "no longer disclose sales figures", " and admitted that it has moved too quickly.

Xiaomi already has 54 stores \u2014 three of which have surpassed $14.5 million (RMB 100 million) in gross merchandise volume (GMV) in 2016. The Mi Home stores bear a striking resemblance to Apple Stores in the U.S., and it\u2019s here that the company hopes to reinvigorate smartphone sales. Before, customers purchased devices online, but now they can peruse Xiaomi\u2019s selection at a mall or any offline retail shop, without the typical markup.", "\u201cBecause we control the experience in our [Mi Homes], we\u2019ve been able to get the cost of the channels close to online, if not lower.

Drew Boortz, managing vice president for Nexon America, noted that it was a bit of a dour talk, and said there has never been a better time to be in games. Michael Chang, senior vice president of corporate development at NCSoft, agreed, noting games is now a $100 billion business.", "But Della Rocca played the bad cop delivering the bad news to developers. And he wants their pitches to get better so that they show an understanding of an investor\u2019s point of view. Here\u2019s his list of reasons why developers won\u2019t get funded.", "Della Rocca said that he goes out on a show floor and finds a surprising thing. Many developers know they are making a crappy game, but they are pitching it anyway.", "He said you can tell this by asking the developer what they think of their own game. \u201cIf you think it is not a great game, in your gut, that is the first indicator. A lot of developers don\u2019t do competitive or market analysis.\u201d", "He added, \u201cAre you\u00a0doing a robot ninja game? \u2026 What do sales look like for that genre? You can do Steam Spy sales checks. If every other one has only sold 500 copies, maybe it is not a good niche. You can ask, \u2018How close am I\u00a0to the successful ones? Or how close to the ones that did not do well?\u2019. Coming to events and shows is a good barometer. It\u2019s not a\u00a0perfect science.\u201d", "Developers often go to investors when they have a problem. They talk about the problem, discuss why a game is taking longer, didn\u2019t properly budget a lot of costs like marketing, or need to hire an audio person. Then they ask the investor, \u201cAre you interested?\u201d", "Della Rocca said this isn\u2019t a good sales pitch. Money is always a problem. But you have to pitch why this is a good opportunity for the investor. You may have a cash flow problem, but don\u2019t dwell on it; instead, talk about why this is going to turn out well.", "Della Rocca often hears from founders that they will quit their jobs if they can raise $10 million up front. That puts all the risk on the investor, and the founder assumes no risk.", "\u201cYou don\u2019t want to risk your own resources,\u201d Della Rocca said. \u201cSo let\u2019s get a sucker to take on the risk. Developers may not see it that way, but to an investor, that is how it is perceived. You will never get funding if you are offloading all the risk.\u201d", "Above: Jason Della Rocca is tired of getting pitched crappy ideas for games.", "The classic problem here is confusion over whether you are raising funds for your company or are raising funds for the project. You typically have to exchange equity, or ownership in your company, with an investor who gives you money for your company.", "Venture capitalists often do this kind of investment. They rarely invest in game projects, or a single game. If you need to raise money for a project, you will generally do a revenue-sharing deal with a publisher or some other kind of financier. Don\u2019t pitch a project to a VC\u00a0\u2014 it\u2019s a waste of their time and yours.", "There is no way you will get $10 million out of the gate, unless you are a development superstar. You will likely get funding in tranches, or one batch at a time, and those tranches will be tied to milestones.", "\u201cWe are looking for key proof points, to see the traction that validates funding,\u201d Della Rocca said.", "A good example is raising money via crowdfunding. If you need $500,000 to finish a game, you need to ask for that. On Kickstarter, developers often lowball it to ensure they get some money, and ask for $20,000. This is very dangerous, as you might get $50,000, but you\u2019ll be far short of what you need to finish the game, Della Rocca said.", "Developers think about the money they need to finish the game. But they can forget the budget for marketing, the money to attend trade shows to meet with publishers, the bills to pay for trailers and working with influencers, and other non-development costs. Developers may also not get paid for months by app stores, so there has to be a budget to meet payroll after the game launches.", "Above: Jason Della Rocca wants developers to make better pitches for games.", "When you\u2019re starting out, you need to get seed money from the typical friends, family, and \u201cfools,\u201d Della Rocca said. These are small amounts like $20,000 to $50,000. Again, you don\u2019t want to approach a venture capitalist who writes checks for $20 million, Della Rocca said.", "\u201cYou don\u2019t go to your uncle for $10 million, either,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a complete mismatch of when you go talk to investors.\u201d", "Game companies should be incorporated, like other startups. If an investor is writing a check, it ought to go to that incorporated entity, not the founder\u2019s personal bank account. And the equity within the company should be divided up properly, in a way that makes sense.", "That means your uncle or aunt who gave you $10,000 should not own half the company, Della Rocca said.", "\u201cInvestors will scrutinize your equity divisions to make sure the people running the company are sufficiently motivated to succeed,\u201d Della Rocca said.", "There are smart ways to divide up the revenue when it comes in. Della Rocca, as an investor, wants to see a lot of the revenue go back into the company so that it can invest for the future. But often, developers promise big shares of revenue to contractors such as audio directors, or to others on the team. That kind of revenue sharing can drive away publishers, who also want their share.", "Another way to drive away investors is to have problems among the founders. If one leaves and demands that their share of the work be removed from the game, then that can instigate a lot of drama. Or perhaps the firm uses open source software and doesn\u2019t disclose that.", "\u201cI\u00a0don\u2019t\u00a0want to invest and find out later half of it goes away because a dispute with a cofounder,\u201d Della Rocca said.", "It\u2019s risky to develop games in geographic trouble spots, such as war zones. Della Rocca said it\u2019s also hard to invest money into and extract exit money from certain territories like Argentina, China, and Russia.", "\u201cThere is friction,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there are issues with the rigorousness of corporate law. Can we go to Russia to fight in the courts if we need to?\u201d", "Disclosure: Casual Connect paid my way to Berlin.

The first encounter was with a human agent who worked for an airline. When I went to check in, she informed me that, because I failed to show up at least an hour early, technically I had missed my flight and had to buy a new ticket. For context, I was mere minutes past\u00a0the wire, and the airport I was flying from generally had security lines that range from 0 to 5 minute waits.

I bought a new ticket, went through security, and then to kill time I watched them board my original flight.", "My connection in the major airport having been thoroughly thrown into disarray, I decided to console myself with an overpriced treat from a shop in the terminal. The shop was quite large, so they had two check-out stands. However, the clerk, who had apparently been craving some human touch points herself, had left her post to converse with the other clerk on the far side of the store. I ventured across the store to give them my money and was made to feel like I had barged into their private living room, demanding to be served. Not being the type to make a fuss, I waited for her to finish her story before acknowledging me.", "Next on my tour-de-force of human touch points was the immigration agent.

However, when it is working well for one company, why is it not quickly adopted by all the competitors in that same vertical? Walking past the airline check-in counters is a visual representation of the absurdity of the current situation. Check-in machines are available for some airlines and conspicuously absent from the airline right next to them.", "It is hard to square this circle mentally until we look at the demographics of the 33 percent of people (the leftovers from the Nuance study above) who don\u2019t prefer self-service machines. The most telling metric is age. Suffice it to say, this is the 33 percent of society most likely to call their grandchildren to ask what tweeting means.", "Unfortunately for the rest of us, that 33 percent is also generally the voting majority of board members for most big\u00a0companies. This gives more clarity to the selective reluctance of certain companies to implement machines into their workflow. Frankly, if I needed to gain approval from my grandfather for every technology purchase I wanted to make, I would be writing this article on a typewriter and calling it in to my editor on a rotary phone.", "The question should be, then, when self-service machines are better in every measurable money-making metric, are the Luddite companies not in violation of their fiduciary obligation to shareholders?", "Perhaps it is time that shareholders start demanding more measures to ensure that companies are up to date on the latest technological trends.", "Should shareholders be able to audit the technology of a company, where a specialized team could do a cost-benefit analysis of implementing automating systems? Should there be mandatory board seats for younger, more tech-savvy members who can help drag these organizations into the 21st century? After all, $1.6 billion per year seems like a pretty major oversight, and airlines are far from the only offenders. Something as important as technology implementation should not be left to the whim of a group of people who are, by their nature, technologically averse.", "I am fine debating every person who secretly longs for a time when a friendly attendant would pump your gas. They are welcome to hold their personal opinions about the importance of human touch points. However, when those beliefs take precedence over research results and company profits \u2014 and most importantly, my travel experiences \u2014 it is time for more drastic measures.

Then I dove into the mountainous Montuyoc region, where Santa Blanca was trying to train an elite army. My team\u2019s job was to stop them.", "In my preview session, I started out on a mountain. My first mission was to rescue a man who had some information that I needed. But when I clicked on the marker, I found the target was a few kilometers away on top of another mountain. So the first thing I had to do was drive my jeep on the narrow mountain roads and head up the mountain. I seriously thought that Ubisoft could have made this beginning a little more exciting, but I went along. While I was driving, I listened to the radio station in the car. The DJ was a mouthpiece for the Santa Blanca cartel, and I sensed just how much of this country was against me.", "I accidentally ran over a pedestrian who wouldn\u2019t get out of the way. And then I received the warning that killing civilians could turn the population against me, and that could have grave consequences later in the game.", "I arrived at the compound and did minimal recon. I could have thrown my drone into the air and then identified each one of the guards and mapped them out. I didn\u2019t bother. I went in shooting, ambushing the first guard I could see. That wasn\u2019t the wisest of moves, but I was testing the system.", "I learned that I had to duck into cover or get shot. The nine guards there weren\u2019t a match for me and my three comrades. But I managed to get too close to the guards and got shot once. I had to be revived by a friendly. We took out the guards, freed the captive, and then delivered him to an extraction point. It was a relatively easy, self-contained mission. Then I moved on to the mission below.", "Once again, I went in fairly blind and started shooting. If you want, you can put silencers on your gun and then your comrades will copy you. If you go in with guns blazing, they will do so as well. I completed another mission quickly, taking out guards, getting the intel, and then escaping before reinforcements came.", "I could have kept doing that, but I received a radio call from the rebel leader. The rebels are a constant nuisance to the Santa Blanca cartel and the country\u2019s military, the Unidad. The cartel and the military are usually in cahoots, but you can play them off against each other. For instance, if both factions are nearby, you can shoot one of them and then hide. The soldiers on both sides will draw their guns and shoot at each other. During that time, you can get your mission done.", "In any case, the rebel leader wanted me to hijack some trucks and bring him some supplies. In some provinces, the rebels are weak. In others, they are strong. If you help them out, they will grow stronger and they will help you as well. So I went after some convoys and captured supplies for the rebels. That job proved rather easy. I simply drove up next to the Unidad convoy. My soldiers shot and blew up the accompanying cars, and then shot the convoy truck until the guards gave up. I got the supplies and the rebels were happy. I was expecting a protracted chase, but the convoy truck couldn\u2019t take much damage.", "As I completed missions, I picked up skills and applied them to my soldier so I could upgrade my weapons and other capabilities. At first, the rebel leader was disappointed I only had four soldiers. But my leader informed him that was all we needed, as the ghosts were badasses.", "As I returned to the main story, I found it easy to find out what I needed to do next by looking at the map. I drove to a farm and finally used a drone. It didn\u2019t have much range, but it was able to identify some bad guys. For some reason, it wasn\u2019t guarded well. So I rushed in, got the Intel, and moved on.\u00a0Then\u00a0I got shot again and had to be revived.", "I found from the Intel that I could uncover a number of targets such as rebel operations, supply dumps, and skill point locations. By completing missions in those locations, I could gather strength. Or I could simply move on to the next main mission.", "During the mission briefings, I received instructions from my overseer. But the\u00a0game had no elaborate cinematics that introduced each new mission. That allowed me to proceed quickly through multiple missions in a relatively short time. On the other hand, I sort of lost interest in the story, or lack of it. In a way, I kind of missed having extended cinematics, rather than just voice overs, between missions.", "One of the things I liked is listening to the propaganda on the radio. I also enjoyed the banter between my fellow soldiers. Once in a while, it got serious, like when one soldier disclosed that he was getting a divorce because his wife never knew where he was.", "It didn\u2019t feel like it at first, but every mission against the Santa Blanca cartel was weakening their influence in the region. If\u00a0I got far enough in that task, I would be able to gather intelligence on the region\u2019s boss, and then take that boss out. Then I could go on to liberate another of the 21 regions.", "Like I said. It\u2019s an endless mission to take over the country, but the good thing about it is that each of the tiny missions that you perform along the way are compelling. The graphics look awesome, even for an open world, and that was cool.", "Soon enough, I got a little braver and tried to fly a helicopter. It wasn\u2019t easy to fly, like you find in a Battlefield game. Rather, you have to learn how to do it right. I could raise or lower the aircraft with one trigger, and then tilt the nose until it started moving toward the direction it was pointing. If I got the angle just right, I would move along. But it took getting used to.", "Abboud at Ubisoft said they wanted to make the game challenging and make sure that travel didn\u2019t get boring. So they made the helicopter flying harder and more realistic. I thought that was tough on early users, but it made sense for the long run, given how long the game is. Hopefully, by the time I finish the game, I\u2019ll learn how to fly a helicopter.", "I finished my play session in a couple of hours. I didn\u2019t get too far into the missions of a single region. i have no idea\u00a0how long it will take to finish the whole game.

All of these things are part of my greater identity and my ideology, but they do not singularly define me, and I am painfully aware when I\u2019m being treated \u2018specially\u2019 by nature of what makes me look different.

I was brought in because of my ideas, my intelligence, my ability.

Focus on creating and fostering diversity of perspective and thought as a business goal, and inevitably your ethnic and gender diversity stats will improve as a result. The smartest, most capable people in the world come from every race, gender, and socioeconomic background.

It didn\u2019t succeed, but now it found a new use for the same technology. The company now plans to use holography to make inexpensive transparent displays for augmented reality smartglasses.", "Augmented reality is expected to be a $90 billion market by 2020, according to tech advisor Digi-Capital. And while big companies such as Microsoft, maker of the HoloLens AR smartglasses, could be rivals, Akonia hopes instead to be a component supplier, providing the designs and initial prototypes for holographic displays in AR smartglasses, said Ken Anderson, CEO of Akonia, in an interview with VentureBeat.", "The team started working on holographic data storage in the 1990s at Bell Labs, then spun out of Bell Labs in 2000 as InPhase Technologies. But that company eventually went bankrupt, and Akonia was founded in August 2012 after acquiring millions of dollars in assets and the entire 200-patent portfolio from InPhase. The goal was to produce a storage product.", "But during the past year, the company decided to shift markets and repurpose its displays for AR, using what it calls its HoloMirror technology, which the company says is the perfect solution for the transparent eyepiece that combines the view of the outside world with a computer display.", "The company is making volume holographic reflective and waveguide optics for transparent display elements in smartglasses. That tech produces quality imagery, transparency, and low costs. Chris Berliner, director of business development, said that the company can provide ultra-clear, full-color displays and a wide field of view. The company is initially targeting a 60-degree field of view.", "Above: A view of Akonia\u2019s holographic capabilities.", "\u201cWe believe we can solve the problem of the eyeglass that sits in front of your eyeball,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cYou can overlay something like a green arrow for navigation or a Pikachu for a game.\u201d", "Akonia hopes to raise money in the coming months to get a pilot line going to manufacture the displays. But over time, it hopes to find a big partner that can handle the manufacturing. Akonia is working with customers now who are paying engineering fees to develop prototypes. It isn\u2019t too complex, as it is essentially one piece of plastic in between two pieces of glass.", "\u201cOur proprietary holographic photopolymers have been developed and refined for over 2 decades, and along with our ability to design and develop complex holographic recording systems we have a unique insight into how to use holography to create the most elusive and difficult component of an AR headset: a thin, transparent eyepiece that provides good display performance at a reasonable cost,\u201d Anderson said.", "Akonia hopes to get production going by 2018 or so. The company has 20 employees now. It previously raised money for its data storage plans, but it is using that money for the display technology now.", "\u201cOur end goal is to license the technology,\u201d Anderson said.", "The company has poured about $100 million into its holographic technology over the past two decades. The company has 165 patents, including a few dozen related to augmented reality.", "\u201cIt\u2019s been hard work,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cOptics doesn\u2019t really obey Moore\u2019s Law (the prediction that the number of components on a chip doubles every couple of years). \u201cWe think we have cracked the code on this component. We\u2019ve used lenses for hundreds of years, and we hope holography will give us a new way to manipulate light.\u201d", "Of course, there is a difference between displaying a 3D holographic image (like Princess Leia in Star Wars) and using holograms to manipulate light like what is done in Akonia\u2019s eyepieces. Akonia is not unique in its attempt to use holography in this manner. Many companies from around the world have been working on holographic eyepieces for decades. Why? Because holography has one huge benefit: It can manipulate light while being perfectly invisible, which is exactly what is needed in an eyepiece.", "To create this eyepiece, multiple approaches have been taken by companies like Lumus (louvered mirrors), Microsoft (surface gratings), ODG (tilted surfaces), Sony (thin holograms), and others. But Anderson believes no one has developed an eyepiece that checks all the performance boxes.", "Akonia is taking an entirely new holographic approach that utilizes its high-performance photopolymers, along with expertise in combining a multitude of holograms in a single layer of polymer to better control the quality and size of the images that are being redirected towards the eye.", "\u201cUsing more holograms in the eyepiece gives it more control of the image, and therefore one has more knobs by which to optimize the eyepiece\u2019s performance,\u201d said Anderson. \u201cThe trick is getting all of the holograms to work together constructively over a large field of view and color spectrum simultaneously. This is what nobody else in the world can do, but we can.\u201d", "He believes Akonia\u2019s HoloMirror technology will finally enable AR headsets to be thin, transparent, vibrant, full-color, and have a wide field of view at a fraction of the cost of competitors.", "After a year and a half of development, Akonia is now demonstrating full-color eyepieces that have never before been possible with holography.The goal is to show a full-color, wide-field-of-view eyepiece by summer."]}

And now the company has been entrusted with the development of Square Enix\u2019s Final Fantasy VII Remake.", "But CyberConnect2 is barely recognizable on the global stage. While it is well known to Japanese gamers, it has a way to go before it has solid name recognition in Western markets. Hiroshi Matsuyama, the gregarious CEO of CyberConnect2, is aware of that and he\u2019s trying to do something about it. I met Matsuyama on a recent trip to Japan, where I moderated a session on Matsuyama\u2019s expansion plans in Canada and also visited the company\u2019s headquarters. It seemed to me that the company\u2019s challenges in going global and sticking to its knitting are similar to the quandaries that many game studios face around the world as they try to decide where to grow next on the path to leveling up.", "That headquarters in Fukuoka \u2014 a city of 1.48 million on the southern Japanese island of Kyushu \u2014 was bursting at the seams with developers.

CyberConnect2 has another office in Tokyo with 30 employees, and it has just opened a new studio in Montreal, its first foray into an international location. Live camera feeds connect the locations.", "The company maintains its close relations with Japanese publishers through its Tokyo office. It makes its games for the most part in Fukuoka (though all offices work on all games), and through Montreal, the company hopes to broaden its reach beyond a single development culture and make games for the international market.", "Above: Hiroshi Matsuyama (left) of CyberConnect2 with Martial Pag\u00e9, Minister and Deputy Head of Mission for Canada in Tokyo.", "The company has come far since a friend of Matsuyama\u2019s started CyberConnect in 1996.

That was about the same time that the PlayStation 2 was hitting the market.", "\u201cWe started without around 10, and now we\u2019ve got 200 in Fukuoka, 30 in Tokyo, and eventually 50 in Montreal,\u201d Matsuyama said, speaking through a translator. \u201cOur focus has always been on the software.\u201d", "In 2002, CyberConnect2 published its first .hack//Infection game, an action role-playing game for the PS2 that was built by CyberConnect2 and published by Bandai. Matsuyama played a key role in the development of the concept for the series about monsters in the digital world of viruses and hackers. The .hack// games sold well, particularly in Japan, and they put CyberConnect2 on the map \u2014 at least in Japan.", "Above: Some of CyberConnect2\u2019s console games.", "Matsuyama also played a big role in pitching the Naruto fighting video games to the manga series creators. The pitch was accepted, and the company developed a series of Naruto games that Bandai published on the PlayStation 2 and other platforms. That series sold more than 10 million units worldwide, and it fueled CyberConnect2\u2019s growth as a company.", "CyberConnect2 became one of Japan\u2019s largest independent studios. The company developed very close relationships with a few game publishers so that it could focus on the art of making games, Matsuyama said.", "\u201cWe want to get better at developing games so we can make the children around the world smile,\u201d Matsuyama said.", "Around 2008, the company started making more original games such as Asura\u2019s Wrath and JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure. CyberConnect2 makes both mobile and console games now, but much of its heavy-duty development is still focused on consoles.", "Above: CyberConnect2\u2019s entrance in Fukuoka, Japan.", "For the past five years, CyberConnect2 has been preparing to launch its new studio in Montreal, and in 2016 it finally made the move. Koji Yamanouchi, a veteran developer at CyberConnect2, became the studio manager in Montreal. In a Skype call, he described how it was difficult moving to Montreal, where he not only had to try to learn English but also French in order to communicate with the locals. Building a studio in a strange city, with people from multiple cultures, has become an interesting experiment. But Yamanouchi said he felt like it would be an interesting challenge to build a multicultural team that was filled with like-minded adventurous game developers who love the craft.", "\u201cWe want to recruit both students and veterans,\u201d Matsuyama said.", "Matsuyama said that he hopes to build the Montreal studio into 40 or 50 people eventually. Asked what the studio will make, Matsuyama said that the purpose is to make games that help make the dreams of children come true.", "The company chose Montreal in part because it has more than 10,000 game employees, and it\u2019s already a big player in the world\u2019s game industry. By moving into such an international city, CyberConnect2 can have contact with and learn from locals who are already good at global gaming. Matsuyama also said that CyberConnect2 wanted to be one of the first big Japanese companies \u2014 aside from Square Enix\u2019s Eidos division \u2014 to create a large operation in Montreal, a place where there\u2019s a large support system for new ventures.", "Above: CyberConnect2 turned 20 in 2016.", "\u201cCreativity doesn\u2019t have any restrictions,\u201d Matsuyama said. \u201cWe want to get some very interesting chemical reactions.\u201d", "But part of the reason for opening Montreal is a recognition that the Japanese way isn\u2019t always right. Japanese game developers don\u2019t have all the instincts when it comes to figuring out content that various global audiences will enjoy. Matsuyama wants the Montreal team to be able to tell the Japanese teams when they are\u00a0unconsciously overstepping or even being offensive to people from other cultures.", "\u201cThis is the kind of information that we want to get, and it helps that Montreal is a multicultural place,\u201d Matsuyama said.", "CyberConnect2 has sold more than 20 million games. That\u2019s a lot for any local developer, but it\u2019s not much when you think about the world\u2019s biggest game companies. And while Matsuyama wants to expand in new territories and make games that are appealing to global audiences, he doesn\u2019t want to forget that CyberConnect2 is a Japanese company and one of the only game companies with roots in Fukuoka, where the game community is strong but small.", "Matsuyama wants the community to grow together and create new talent, and he helped set up a group that has monthly meetings that bring together people from more than a dozen game companies in Kyushu. The group has contests to promote and foster new developers in the region.", "\u201cOne interest is to make Fukuoka the Hollywood of the game industry,\u201d Matsuyama said. \u201cThe game companies are increasing, but not enough. We have to make it more appealing and charming.\u201d", "That might sound too ambitious, but he noted that Montreal\u2019s development community was about as big as Fukuoka\u2019s just 10 years ago. If Fukuoka can breed companies that grow fast, it could also be a big player on the global stage.", "At CyberConnect2, the company is working hard on the Final Fantasy VII Remake, a title that is so beloved that the crowd cheered when Sony announced in 2015 that Square Enix planned to publish a remake of the game. Matsuyama can\u2019t talk about it much, but Square Enix publicly announced that CyberConnect2 is working on the game.", "Above: Manga collection at CyberConnect2.", "Ultimately, CyberConnect2 will have to figure out what its next level will be. If Final Fantasy VII Remake is successful, that will raise the company\u2019s profile.", "Once they become as large as CyberConnect2, many large developers choose to become game publishers themselves or move into multiple businesses. But CyberConnect2 has yet to stray far from making games. Matsuyama knows that it\u2019s risky to put everyone to work on the same games, but he doesn\u2019t want to stray too far from the franchises that the company has excelled at making. CyberConnect2 can work on about eight games at once now, about half consoles and half mobile.\u00a0Matsuyama is also experimenting on a new intellectual property in virtual reality.", "And it still focuses on making games that its developers want to make, rather than making games that others want them to make or games that the company has to do in order to make money.", "\u201cWe can make what we want to make,\u201d Matsuyama said. \u201cWe have never made games that we didn\u2019t want to do. We are not satisfied with our place in the hierarchy in the food chain. But CyberConnect2 is very cool, and we are known as talented and skillful. We are not aiming just to expand. We want to make the world happy with our games.\u201d", "Disclosure: The Canadian government paid my way to Japan. Our coverage remains objective."]}

Havas", "content": ["Machine intelligence", " (MI) is fast outgrowing its cradle in the technology department. This calls for a new, high-level executive function and a strategic roadmap. In this article I\u2019ll outline some areas for your new CMIO to crack during 2017 and beyond.", "At a time when machines are learning how to run brick-and-mortar retail stores, starting to beat doctors in diagnoses, and even inventing their own secret languages, it\u2019s natural for machine intelligence to raise questions and issues. Having had the privilege to work on and oversee many MI* projects already, and diving deeper into the topic with each passing day, I see the future bringing more boon than doom for companies and individuals alike, as long the benefits and challenges are tackled with seriousness.", "One of the strongest predictors of a society\u2019s well-being is its productivity, and machine intelligence is bound to be a productivity beast: IBM Watson handles in seconds or minutes what would take a doctor, a lawyer, or their back office teams weeks or months of work; Amazon\u2019s Go store uses MI to enable a lightning-fast retail experience without checkouts; Google\u2019s MI already translates from and to languages it hasn\u2019t encountered before; and Salesforce\u2019s enterprise MI can dramatically cut administration, reporting, and coordination efforts, which now suck up over 50 percent of management\u2019s time. All this will give people more time to think, manage other people, use judgment, and simply work with things that bring them joy.", "Undoubtedly machine intelligence, like all technological disruptions, will bring also challenges, and will likely make the internet revolution look tiny in comparison. Still, while it\u2019s widely seen as key to future success, details and comprehensive roadmaps are often missing, as is the sense of where MI should even live within the organization. In my point of view, it should be key to any large company\u2019s strategy, and it should be led by a senior leader who reports directly to the CEO. These chief machine intelligence officers, or CMIOs, will be tasked to bring all business departments, as well as the company as a whole, to the machine intelligence age. If you are one of these people, or looking to hire one, below you\u2019ll find some key CMIO-level challenges to tackle.", "Where are the hidden connections awaiting discovery? What are the key things you should be able to diagnose and predict in real time? Which routine but massive tasks should you automate? Where should you use fast, contextual customization and real-time optimization at scale? These are some of the most promising areas of MI\u2019s value in business use. The CMIO will need to have a thorough understanding of the company\u2019s environment, its business processes, and their relationships to assess the biggest opportunities as well as the most acute urgencies.", "In some areas, MI won\u2019t even be bringing competitive advantage \u2014 it\u2019ll be the price of doing business. The adoption rate of new technologies has accelerated dramatically throughout history, and we now have the mobile internet, accessible cloud services, and much of the Internet of Things already in place. MI can in this setting take over entire industries faster than preceding technologies did, and will lead a deep transformation of the organization\u2019s operating models. How will, for example, Google make money when we don\u2019t browse through search results anymore, but simply pose a question and expect one right answer, as well as instant execution? Laggards will face hardships and even extinction, as did stubborn incumbents facing internet-born companies. Only this time, the effect is bound to be even more dramatic.", "Alongside machine intelligence, design thinking and customer experience management will be critical concepts for business success in the near future. People are not rational calculators, and they often value soft experience factors even more than hard, objective value. MI holds vast potential in providing more valuable experiences to people, and the CMIO needs to work with design departments and agencies to unearth these opportunities.", "MI can streamline the everyday, remove tasks to get jobs done, make the previously impossible possible, empower and educate people, tailor and personalize products and services, enable important connections with people and things, make experiences safe and secure, and\u00a0enable completely new forms of storytelling and entertainment. These are just some areas for innovating experiences, but across all of them, seamless transitions between platforms and devices will be key.", "And MI will not touch just the ", "what", ". My friend Alexander Manu\u2019s upcoming book will revolve around the insight that in the behavior economy, the delivery (the how) is indeed the whole value proposition (the what). Chatbots and cognitive personal assistants are already making many common tasks smoother and more automatic, and learning about their masters as they go.", "Mind also that you have both internal and external customers. Externally facing applications are usually instantly viable where problems are simple and ample data available. Where problems are murkier and data exploratory or scarce, it\u2019s still often better to build decision and support systems for your staff. Their experience in dealing with customers and customer data can thus be greatly enhanced.", "How much autonomy to give the MI solutions working with and for your customers, staff, and other stakeholders is a key question. Ideally, intelligent systems should take care of mundane tasks all by themselves, but even where they already can, people might not yet trust them. The fact that Google\u2019s AIs Bob, Alice, and Eve figured out how to speak to each other in a language humans can\u2019t decipher made some people worried. And as already happened years ago, haywire trading bots have caused flash crashes and millions of damage.", "In his book ", "Superintelligence", ",\u00a0Nick Bostrom divides machine intelligences into three levels: Oracles tell their users what they need to know, like Google Search has done for a couple of decades now; Genies can carry out their masters\u2019 wishes, but only upon request, the way Siri now works; and Sovereigns require only a few key principles to operate independently on behalf of their hosts. While true sovereigns don\u2019t yet exist, robot portfolios by brokerages can be considered their present-day relatives.", "Whichever level of independence you set on, CMIOs also need to lead the development and monitor the performance of the company\u2019s MI interaction practices. MI systems increasingly interact with users via text and voice, sometimes also called the \u201cinterface of least resistance.\u201d Gartner predicts that within four years, ", "30 percent of searches", " will be done without a screen; first via voice, then maybe via brainwaves.", "While conversation is the most human of interactions, it\u2019s not always the most natural medium for brands. Instead of logos, tag lines, and other common brand assets, the brand\u2019s essence will distill down to questions, answers, micro-interactions, sentiment, and style of conversation, even pauses. These will become important business and brand factors, and metrics and analytics will need to evolve to reflect these nuances.", "A key task for the CMIO, together with the CTO, COO and/or CFO, is to figure out the technical architecture of machine intelligence, along with a roadmap and investment plan. The MI ecosystem is already a flowering and fast-growing garden with a mix of cloud services and on-site solutions, as well as hardware and sensors available for companies large and small, for core and support functions alike, and customized for different industries and sectors. The technology stack also includes several levels vertically, from understanding natural language and abstract concepts to data collection, data sciences, and machine learning, as well as general-purpose libraries and MI training grounds. There are already many vendors of ready-to-use capabilities and APIs, and also lots of free or cheap resources to build your own solutions from scratch.", "While open source, free-to-use libraries like Google\u2019s TensorFlow might sound great at the outset, think before embarking on a quest to build MI in-house. Even though the basic tools might be free, you\u2019ll need a cadre of experienced scientists and specialists to develop the self-improving machine intelligence models and algorithms. This is not easy: Capable people are hard to find, not to mention expensive. In StackOverflow\u2019s survey, only 0.1 percent of respondents recognized themselves as machine learning developers, and 1.9 percent had\u00a0a background in math or statistics, key skills for MI development. Even with easy-to-use interfaces and options to train MIs by talking to them, you\u2019ll still need the experts when something needs fixing or tweaking.", "So, rather than trying to best Google, Salesforce, Amazon, Microsoft, IBM, and Facebook in a global talent hunt, partnering with these companies is a viable option. It will also bring in the added benefit of combining the big players\u2019 MI stacks with the tools you already use daily. Especially for niche, specialized purposes, there\u2019s an ever-growing selection of small but potentially very suitable providers. But remember also that in machine intelligence, scale is usually a benefit, since bigger data means faster and better learning opportunities.", "An MI system needs to learn constantly, because it\u2019s just\u00a0a baby at its release. In fact, researchers are now creating virtual babies to help them understand how babies learn and teach computers to learn faster. Charting out learning goals and strategies for the company\u2019s MI initiatives is a critical task for the CMIO. Constant streams of data play a critical part in learning, and a rule of thumb for data for MI is \u201cthe more the better.\u201d A key strength of MI is that it doesn\u2019t need to take samples \u2014 it can learn directly from all available data, making insights and predictions more solid. While it\u2019s great to have a theory (or even just a guess) about\u00a0how the data and the problem might link, remember that MI can help make novel connections, find new opportunities, and answer the questions you haven\u2019t even thought to ask, so long as there\u2019s troves of data available.", "Different problems will require different learning paradigms, with reinforcement, supervised learning, and unsupervised learning being a few of the most well-known methods of machine learning today. For training purposes there\u2019s already an ecosystem: Elon Musk\u2019s OpenAI just opened Universe, which provides tools for everyone to train, measure, and evaluate intelligent systems; OpenAI Gym is used to train reinforcement algorithms; and Microsoft has open-sourced its\u00a0Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit to speed up development of MI applications and is gaining traction. If even the most secretive tech company, Apple, is\u00a0opening up its\u00a0MI research to the wider academic community, it should be clear that the future of MI leans on collaboration and collective learning.", "A good way of thinking about training your intelligent system is making it a game, with triggers, actions, failures, and successes, as well as reward and feedback loops, that can be easily understood by people and machines alike. The research company L2 aptly sums the importance of learning by outlining the formula for value in the future as: ", "amount of data sensors available", "\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0", "actionable intelligence that can be fed back to the system", "\u00a0=\u00a0", "value proposition", ".", "Last but not least, the CMIO will need to tackle the human component of intelligent systems, as MIs don\u2019t yet manage on their own. People are required simply to behave in ways that leave a data trail that the MI can measure, learn from, and apply to new situations. But humans\u00a0are also needed to intermittently check data, tweak algorithms, provide training sets, and coach the MIs on their correct and incorrect judgments, as well as manage situations that the MI isn\u2019t able to independently resolve.", "Reinforcement learning and supervised learning require more of the human component, while unsupervised learning lets the machine learn on its own. That last one, however, is still the most experimental of the three, and even unsupervised systems don\u2019t (yet) build themselves.\u00a0", "Google AI Experiments", " is an engaging example of how everyone on the internet can be harnessed to play with intelligent systems, and train them in an open learning environment.", "A thing to keep in mind is that MI systems are still built by people, so they can perpetuate their creators\u2019 biases if this is not properly controlled for. This does not just concern\u00a0the scientists creating the algorithms, but also the annotators labeling the training sets. As a practical example, when measuring on a scale of 1 to 5, women rate the same puppies 0.16 stars cuter on average than men do. This is a statistically significant divergence, and it matters if you\u2019re teaching your MI about the concept of cuteness, for example.", "Even with a seemingly perfect system, the CMIO still needs to decide how much to trust the machines, how much control to retain, and how to establish checks and balances\u00a0with people. As already mentioned, one of MI\u2019s brightest\u00a0promises is that it will allow your human components to focus more time on human work, such as judgment, socializing, and networking, as well as creativity. Over time, the need for control should diminish.", "At Havas, we currently have many marketing and product initiatives utilizing MI underway, worldwide and across industries. Perhaps the one closest to my heart is still the \u201cMost Confident Fan\u201d initiative, which we created with our clients TD Ameritrade and IBM Watson, to provide\u00a0a new take on TD Ameritrade\u2019s NFL sponsorship. For the football season, we created an engaging web application that measured how the fans\u2019 confidence about their team as expressed in social channels correlated with the team\u2019s success. The first-of-its-kind solution fared surprisingly well. For example, it predicted every game of the NFL champions Denver Broncos correctly, including their winning the Super Bowl, in which many considered the Broncos the underdog. But no, unfortunately I didn\u2019t bet on the Broncos.", "Machine intelligence will take over many sectors and verticals in the coming years. And the question is not ", "if", ", or even ", "when", ", but instead ", "how", " are you preparing for the machine intelligence era? Considering machine intelligence a key strategic office in the company is a great first step.", "This article appeared originally on ", "LinkedIn", "."]}

That 50 percent success rate is far greater than typical 3 to 10 percent success rate of bank loans or venture financing, according to the Small Business Administration.", "But another unanticipated trend has emerged over the past few months: Regulation Crowdfunding is spurring the growth of inner city businesses. In fact, 40 percent of companies that have had successful fundraises through Regulation Crowdfunding were financed via Revenue Based Financing (RBF), and almost 100 percent of those were in areas the ICIC (or Initiative for a Competitive Inner City) ", "classifies as an inner city", ".", "So what is RBF, why it is so popular, and how can it be transformative for inner cities and Main Street USA?", "Regulation Crowdfunding made it legal for the average American to invest in startups and small businesses via online websites. It is different from donation or rewards crowdfunding in that it is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, investors are limited as to how much they can invest, entrepreneurs are capped at how much they can raise, and information about a business, its operations, team and use of capital needs to be disclosed.", "Backers are not donors but investors that have a stake in the future outcome of the business. This stake can be an equity ownership, where investors are buying stock in a company, or debt, where investors are loaning money to a business instead of that business trying to get a loan from a bank. All of this is not done via the New York Stock Exchange (which is the domain of massive companies) or at large banks (which have cut off the lending to small businesses) but via online crowdfunding platforms. And many entrepreneurs are using a new breed of security called Revenue Based Financing that doesn\u2019t force an entrepreneur to give up ownership but at the same time appeals to an investor\u2019s need for an immediate ROI.", "Revenue Based Financing is a type of loan whereby entrepreneurs pay back the loan with a percent of monthly revenue over a fixed period of time until a set return is reached. For example, an entrepreneur could borrow $100,000 from the crowd to start a local coffee roasting company and pay back 5 percent of monthly revenue for 48 months or until 2 times the investment (i.e. $200,000) is returned. These types of unconventional loans are not readily available from banks and are not available to borrowers who don\u2019t have more than three years of operating history or collateral to back the loan. These loans work particularly well where a business has (or will have customers) and cash flow and this income may be seasonal or cyclical.", "However, thanks to Regulation Crowdfunding and RBF more and more Main Street businesses are going out to the people who frequent their stores and borrowing money from them to renovate their buildings, expand their operations, buy new equipment or open a new storefront in a town next door. All of this is good for inner city economic development.", "Our data shows that about 10 percent of companies that start campaigns each month are using RBF. It is a strong start given that this type of fundraising wasn\u2019t expected. And as more platforms see the benefit of RBF, they will start promoting it (because it works in favor of investors). As the media covers it more, issuers will understand how it can be applied to their businesses, so we expect the 10 percent number to grow rapidly.", "So what types of companies are pursuing RBF fundraises? One that I\u2019m familiar with is The Native, which raised close to $400,000 on NextSeed for a luxury Hostel it wanted to build in a transformational area of Austin, Texas. Another is Haint Blue Brewing, which raised $210,000 on WeFunder for a craft brewery in a historic part of Mobile, Alabama.", "From my talks with entrepreneurs and crowdfunding platforms involved in RBF fundraises, I\u2019m hearing that over 50 percent of the commitments come from people within the community and over 80 percent had some connection to the issuer (friend or family).", "Within any city there are at least 25 key businesses necessary for its health (think everything from gas station to grocery to pharmacy to hardware, salon, coffee shop, restaurants, and even pet stores). Now that big retailers like ", "Wal-Mart have begun to reverse their growing trend", ", more and more cities are being left without many of these key businesses. With RBF, entrepreneurs who have experience running such businesses can borrow money to open storefronts to support their communities. And when the community invests in a business, it has a vested interest in the outcome of that business and will most likely frequent it more often because they know their use of it will determine whether or not they see a return.", "Because investors in RBF-modeled fundraises start receiving principal and interest repayments almost immediately, their cash isn\u2019t tied up for 7 to 10 years like a typical equity investment. Our data shows that investors are earning on average a 5.75 percent return on their investment paid out monthly, which is much better than money sitting in a savings account.", "We expect to see much more of this type of fundraising in inner cities as the Regulation Crowdfunding market evolves. And the growth will come even faster if the government offers training programs and incentives to foster investment in inner cities. These incentives could include all-day training, co-investment, or top off funds where the local Chamber of Commerce, SBA, or Federal Government Agencies create matching incentives that are tied to positive behaviors of local communities.", "In addition, the Federal government can create tax incentives that allow investors to risk more capital without fear of loss. These incentives could include the ability to write off any loss in a crowdfunding company that fails and the ability for investors to avoid capital gains on interest or income generated from a crowdfund investment.", "Continued growth in successful inner-city small business fundraises could power a resurgence and transformation in those communities, creating jobs and economic prosperity.", "Sherwood Neiss is a partner at\u00a0Crowdfund Capital Advisors. Neiss helped lead the U.S. fight to legalize debt and equity based crowdfunding,\u00a0coauthored\u00a0", "Crowdfund Investing for Dummies", ", and cofounded\u00a0", "Crowdfund Capital Advisors", ",\u00a0where he provides strategy and technology\u00a0services to those seeking to\u00a0benefit from crowdfund investing. Neiss and Jason Best are credited as the fathers of Title III of the JOBS Act. After attending the bill-signing ceremony at the White House, they formed Crowdfund Capital Advisors to study what is happening in crowdfunding, analyze results, report trends, and follow opportunities. They are active investors in the crowd finance space."]}

Brief has to go through lots of appointments with his patients to figure out what might have made them sick, as many as a couple of days after they ate something. The usual tests, such as blood tests or a colonoscopy, don\u2019t catch digestive problems. Instead, the diagnosis involves detailed food studies with dietitians.", "What normally happens is food passes from your stomach to your lower intestine, where it is absorbed into the body. If it passes on to the large intestine, it starts to ferment with the bacteria and produce gas, resulting in flatulence, bloating, pain, or diarrhea, Brief said. Some of the gas particles pass into your lungs, and the Aire digestive tracker can detect the presence of those particles.", "Aire is available on FoodMarble.com to preorder for $99, about $50 off the expected retail price.", "Above: FoodMarble\u2019s Aire detects food gas in your lungs.", "When you breathe into the Aire device, it detects whether you have eaten something that is compatible with your body or not. When I breathed into it, I got a base score of 36, which can be used as a baseline for the future. If your score is near 100, something is wrong. You can also detect other signs of stress, and your sleep quality, and, in the future, correlate that to the results.", "With the Aire device, you get samples of foods with potential triggers\u00a0(dubbed FODMAPs) that include particular solids such as lactose. Then you can take a test every 15 minutes with the Aire to track how it moves through your digestive system. At the end of the test, you can figure out whether you\u2019re reactive to that sample or not.", "Lisa Ruttledge, chief operating officer, said the company can check a lot of typical triggers, such as wheat, fruits, dairy, and many other types of foods. She showed one example where someone ate something that caused a reaction, prompting a high level of gas about 80 minutes after consumption. But each person\u2019s reaction is different.", "Brief said the alternative to the test is something like $500 per doctor visit, where you have to take a test and have it analyzed. And it usually takes multiple tests over time to do a full analysis.", "\u201cThe breakthrough that let us do this comes from the availability of much better sensors,\u201d Shortt said.", "Shortt has been working on the company for a few years.

And what people see as \u2018nothing on\u2019 is quite paradoxical, because free channels in France are spending about 300 billion euros on content.\u201d", "Molotov is a free app that allows users to watch any of the 70 basic free channels in France. It works in partnership with French TV stations, so it\u2019s all perfectly legal. And no cable subscription is required to access the stations. It is a big step toward making those over-the-top (OTT) dreams a reality.", "Its selling point is an elegant interface that immediately shows the user what is being broadcast at that moment. There is no full video-on-demand. Instead, users can \u201cbookmark\u201d their favorite shows, and a limited number of past episodes are stored in the Molotov cloud to be viewed later if you miss them when they are live. The company offers additional storage for premium users.", "By bookmarking a show, you get alerted when it\u2019s going to be on, or that an episode has been saved. If you come to a show late while it\u2019s on live, you can start it at the beginning. Unlike DVR services, Molotov doesn\u2019t let you skip commercials. Denoual said the goal is to improve the experience for users, help them discover more great content and manage it, and create new revenue sources for TV partners.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not designed to kill the business models of channels,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to give you a clear and rapid outlook of what is live.\u201d", "Of course, after failing to strike a deal with TV producers for months, Apple ", "launched its own app recently, called \u201cTV,\u201d", " which attempts to create a unified interface across all video apps on Apple TV. While Siri allows users to search for live content, it\u2019s focused on the existing, rather than live, video in those apps. And viewing ultimately requires you to go into those apps. Meanwhile, rumors continue that what Apple really wants to create is its own subscription TV service.", "It\u2019s no surprise that Molotov is working ", "with", " rather than against the established TV industry. Denoual and the other cofounders have backgrounds working in France\u2019s television industry. That\u2019s allowed them to approach executives nervous about disruptive digital models from a sympathetic viewpoint and to work together to develop Molotov, he said.", "Molotov\u2019s app has been available on almost all iOS, tvOS, Windows, and Android platforms. It allows for a continuous viewing experience across all those platforms. But it also solves the problem of needing a dozen apps for each channel to catch what limited live streams may be available.", "This week, the company announced new partnerships with smart TV makers, including Samsung and LG, that place the app on the TVs and offer special deals on premium cloud storage plans.\u00a0Molotov said it was expanding to add some bundles of paid channels, including Canal+, Cine+, and OCS (the French equivalents of HBO).", "The $24 million Molotov raised will also allow it to begin thinking beyond the French market. Its investors include SKY, the European TV distributor,\u00a0as well as current\u00a0investors, such as Idinvest and some angel funders. The company had previously raised a round of $12 million and has about 50 employees.", "\u201cWhat\u2019s amazing is that people don\u2019t know what\u2019s on TV,\u201d Denoual said. \u201cThey don\u2019t know how rich and how great the channels are.

I came to gaming through a legal background. I worked in middleware for video games and other technology. I moved to Faceit as part of the team that put together their CS league, negotiating with teams and Twitch and other partners.", "GamesBeat: If we\u2019re talking about the comparison to real-world sports, ", "Newzoo says", " that traditional sports leagues such as basketball monetize fans at about $15 per person. Esports right now is monetizing at $2.83 cents per person. Everyone is out to change that. We\u2019ll see how that can happen. Viewed more optimistically, esports revenues are on pace to generate more than $493 million in 2016. That\u2019s up 51 percent on just a year ago. I\u2019ll start with the basic question. What do esports need to do to progress?", "Barry:", " I\u2019m passionate about gaming. I\u2019ve been a gamer my whole life, although I\u2019m relatively new to esports. When you ask about the comparison to traditional sports leagues, it\u2019s a pretty big disconnect now. At Turner, obviously, we do the NBA, we do MLB, we do March Madness, and so on. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re ELeague, MLG, ESL, or whatever. We are not leagues. We\u2019re tournament operators that go out and put on high-end tournaments. We don\u2019t own the IP or the franchises or the teams. There are no by-laws for the players or teams. When you get to real professional sports leagues, the IP is controlled by the league. Everything falls under that umbrella. That\u2019s why it can be extremely profitable and build an ever-growing fan base. It\u2019s easy to connect yourself to a team and a player.", "The hierarchy of professional sports fundamentally goes player, team, consequence. That\u2019s why people love sports. They emotionally connect themselves to a player, who ultimately plays for a team. Different sports have different emphasis. College sports are more about the team than the player. But then you look for the consequence. Esports, because of the fractured nature of where it lives right now, it lacks that emotional connection to players and teams and ultimately the consequence.", "Overwatch and Blizzard just took a big step. That franchise model \u2014 building a league, owning the teams, owning the IP, having a draft and a combine, and building out a real league everybody can get around \u2014 is the right model for the growth of esports at the professional level. There\u2019s nothing wrong with what we do from a tournament activation perspective. We do it very well. But if we\u2019re talking about the stake in the ground, growing the business, and creating something that people can attach themselves to for years to come, then we\u2019re talking about a more established league environment.", "Above: (Left to right) Kurt Pakendorf, chief strategy officer at Faceit; Alex Birns, an investor at venture firm Anthos Capital; and Craig Barry, executive vice president and chief content officer at Turner Sports.", "That\u2019s why it\u2019s important that we see professional teams coming in, whether it\u2019s NBA teams or NFL teams. They\u2019re going to provide structure to what really has no structure right now. They understand the structure of leagues and teams. It\u2019s an important step in the evolution and growth esports.", "Birns:", " Ultimately, the reason why the NFL and NBA and many of these other leagues monetize so well is because they\u2019re more or less monopolies. The problem, from our perspective \u2014 the reality in esports \u2014 is that things are pretty decentralized and fragmented in the overall landscape. Publishers own the IP. The IP isn\u2019t static. Games become more or less popular as a result of what publishers do. How they think about esports varies a lot. Valve and Riot couldn\u2019t be more different in how they approach this stuff.", "The addition of structure, and perhaps some mild centralization \u2014 it\u2019s also going to be good for a lot of players when it comes to being able to make what they\u2019re worth, as opposed to just being spread all over the place. But there are other reasons, structurally, why it\u2019s going to be tough to monetize esports to the same extent as traditional sports, at least in the near term. Digital CPMs, the amount of money you can make on advertising compared to TV, is much lower. The audience is much more global. People are still trying to figure out the best way to monetize users in Russia or eastern Europe or Asia, whereas something like the NBA is dealing almost entirely with American viewers.", "We\u2019re also just early in the process. It took a long time for a lot of that stuff to come together in traditional sports. Football and basketball had their early days with multiple leagues. Baseball was very different in the \u201820s and \u201830s compared to today. Watching games on streaming video has been around for less than 10 years, and in a big way for less than five or six. It takes time for the right business models to appear and evolve, to understand what\u2019s different about users and what they want, what the right content is for the space. Getting all that right takes cycles. It\u2019s hard to rush it. Publishers and developers are still trying to figure that out.", "Going forward we have people making games with esports in mind, as opposed to creating esports hits by accident with games that aren\u2019t necessarily designed as spectator sports, or for monetizing on the esports side. There\u2019s going to be a lot of work going into that. There\u2019s a ton of room to improve relative to where things will be in a few years. Whether we\u2019ll hit the numbers traditional sports hit is a good question. Maybe not. But this can still be a big business without getting anywhere near that.", "Pakendorf:", " Alex was referring to structure. What will be key is providing some certainty. For the industry itself, we need to create an ecosystem in which participants \u2014 people organizing events, people running leagues, people creating and distributing content, teams committing to establishing themselves in that ecosystem \u2014 have a greater sense of certainty around how they operate and how long they\u2019ll be around. That will go some way to helping the industry grow and draw more fans in.", "From the non-endemic side, you look at big traditional family brands that are looking at esports and asking, \u201cHow and where do I get involved?\u201d \u201cWell, there\u2019s an event in three weeks\u2019 time. You can sponsor that.\u201d \u201cWho\u2019s going to be there? These guys or those guys?\u201d That\u2019s a big ask for brands. Whereas if there\u2019s some certainty \u2014 you know who\u2019s going to be where at what time, you can say more about the outcome \u2014 there\u2019s going to be growth. It enables the ecosystem to benefit everybody.", "We can take lessons from more traditional sports as far as how we grow what we do. But I think structure, at this stage, and certainty will help drive growth first and foremost.", "Above: Valve\u2019s Dota 2 in action and running on the original Source engine.", "GamesBeat: We have $20 million prize pools. We can fill stadiums. This feels like a financial success right now. What else is missing?", "Barry:", " I hope it doesn\u2019t sound like I was downplaying leagues, because you just have to know what\u2019s important in the space. For ELeague, what\u2019s important is that we\u2019re serving a community. It\u2019s important that we\u2019re authentic and we serve that community with whatever IP or game we\u2019ve chosen to do.", "When it comes to the economics of esports, that code has not been cracked. The IP holders, the publishers, are by far leveraging the most opportunity in esports. When you see these massive events \u2014 BlizzCon or the International \u2014 these are multi-million dollar events that are built out of marketing budgets to raise awareness around the publisher. They\u2019re not looking to make a profit on the event itself, and quite frankly I don\u2019t think they do. The Call of Duty event at the Forum where Snoop Dogg played was extremely expensive, and it was a marketing play.", "In our business models \u2014 ELeague or MLG or ESL \u2014 nobody\u2019s cracked that code. We\u2019re all still at the vestment stage of esports. We have a passion and belief in the potential behind esports. For us at Turner, it\u2019s important that \u2014 the two simple reasons we got into esports, when we were looking at all the numbers, were that we felt we could make a difference through quality of content and quality of storytelling. We\u2019re content creators at our core.", "That was the differentiator for us. It wasn\u2019t like we see an opportunity to leverage the economics of this business and make it the most successful business we\u2019ve ever gotten into. We felt like we had the opportunity to serve a community and build something from the ground up and differentiate ourselves from everyone else in the community through content creation and execution. That said, that\u2019s a slow burn. There\u2019s no lightning striking there. We don\u2019t stand this thing up and suddenly we\u2019re making three times the money invested. This is a marathon for us."]}

But the second game has more light-hearted \u201clulz,\u201d or hacks done for the sake of humor. Ubisoft needed someone to stay in close touch with hacktivists to give the San Francisco community an authentic flavor. And that job fell to Geffroyd, who met with hacktivist author and journalist Violet Blue and spent a lot of time providing\u00a0fictionalized information about hacking to\u00a0the game designers.", "In particular, the False Prophets mission in Watch Dogs 2 closely resembles ", "Project Chanology", ", a protest movement against the Church of Scientology. That was the first major Anonymous operation. I caught up with Geffroyd at a Ubisoft press event under the Old Mint building in San Francisco.", "Here\u2019s an edited transcript of our conversation.

I mostly serve as the first line of hacking consultants for the team.", "GamesBeat: It seems like you have to absorb all the real-world technology and then somehow find a way to make fun out of it.", "Geffroyd:", " I spent a lot of time going to cons, the big conventions, and bringing back information for the team. Afterward comes the moment where we have to separate what\u2019s authentic, how far we can go, what we can do with that. It\u2019s always a dialogue between the designers and me and the creative director to make sure we stay on the line we want to follow, or at least test the elasticity of that line, between authenticity and having a game that plays well.", "GamesBeat: How did you come across Violet Blue?", "Geffroyd:", " I\u2019ve been close to the hacking community for almost 20 years. I go to DefCon every year. We have common friends. When I was focusing on San Francisco, some friends of mine organized a party so I could meet as many local people as possible. I spent five days with this crowd. That\u2019s when I met Violet. We\u2019ve been talking ever since. We meet at every convention.", "Above: Taking on a gang on the rooftops in Watch Dogs 2.", "GamesBeat: How did you choose San Francisco? Was it already in the cards for some reason?", "Geffroyd:", " We wanted to escape the gloominess of Chicago. We wanted something a little more lively. Also, we wanted to change the tone of the game. For many reasons, the first one was pretty dark. We wanted to do something different.", "GamesBeat: It\u2019s a story about revenge.", "Geffroyd:", " Right. The other reason, we wanted to portray the hacking community\u2019s diversity. There are many ways to talk about hacking, many ways to present the reality of hacking. To us it was a fun way to go through the hacktivist part of it, to have a group of different people. San Francisco came on the map pretty easily, because of the idea we have the city. There\u2019s a long history of anti-conformity that\u2019s core to San Francisco.", "Also, Silicon Valley is nearby. It\u2019s nice to talk about technology, but being here, you\u00a0can drive right down to where that\u2019s all happening. To us it was very important to be grounded not only in the city, but in the world of the technology we\u2019re trying to describe.", "GamesBeat: You always have to fictionalize corporation names. But how real do you think you\u2019re getting as far as depicting corporations and how they behave?", "Geffroyd:", " I think it\u2019ll be pretty clear to everyone who we\u2019re emulating.

They tend to profess to be on the side of openness.", "Geffroyd:", " Of course. \u201cDo no evil,\u201d as they say. Something we\u2019re trying to do in the game\u2014I don\u2019t think we\u2019re in a place like the cyberpunk stories of the \u201880s where corporations are evil, inherently evil. The world we live in and capitalism in general generates its own set of bad behaviors that aren\u2019t inherently thought of as bad. It\u2019s not a business plan to be a bad company. But given the power and the reach they have, it\u2019s very easy for individuals within those companies to misbehave. That\u2019s something we\u2019re trying to illustrate through Du\u0161an. He\u2019s hacking his own company for his own purposes.", "Technology is neutral, after all. It depends on what you do with it. There\u2019s the famous conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein when they were developing the atomic bomb. We\u2019re not trying to tell you what you should or shouldn\u2019t use. But there are things to be aware of. Through this game and the reach it has, we can simplify some problems and make sure people understand what they have in their pocket, the nature of what they do online, the ways it can be used for their own good or for bad things.", "Above: Watch Dogs 2 blends cyber crime and the hacktivist community.", "GamesBeat: There\u2019s an easy message to deliver there, but you kind of already did that with the first Watch Dogs. Is there a more refined message in Watch Dogs 2?", "Geffroyd:", " The hacktivism angle makes it easier for us. In the first game, Aiden is a vengeful character. He\u2019s driven by his own personal passions. The hacktivist aspect of this game\u2014you start like any other group, doing it for the lulz, doing it for fun. Then at some point you realize that some very fishy things are happening behind the curtain. The group becomes activists.", "The message itself, I think, is just to be careful with technology. That\u2019s what we\u2019re narrowing down to. Having this group of different characters that can present different points of view, different approaches to problems, was really interesting to us.", "I don\u2019t think, as game developers, we should be giving lessons about the society we live in. But it\u2019s a duty on our side to expose things that people don\u2019t know. It\u2019s a complex situation, and it\u2019s down to us to simplify it to a point where people get interested and ask more questions about it for their own sake.", "GamesBeat: Maybe there are people in these corporations who could as easily make the right choices.", "Geffroyd:", " Absolutely. Again, I think corporations are made of people. People can be good or bad. Hopefully it goes for the best. But we\u2019ve seen this development of information capitalism happening. There\u2019s a lot of money to be made. It\u2019s very shadowy \u2013 no laws, no regulation whatsoever. A lot of bad things are happening currently with brokers and everything, the processing of data and what they do with that. That\u2019s something we wanted to expose. It\u2019s not even the big companies. It\u2019s a multitude of smaller companies that are grabbing data everywhere, compiling it, and reselling it, for what purpose we don\u2019t know, through what process we don\u2019t know. We don\u2019t understand the algorithms or biases. That\u2019s the reality we\u2019re trying to expose.", "GamesBeat: How much of the real world has gotten into the game in that way?", "Geffroyd:", " To the point that I can talk about it, yes, we have some characters who might be recognizable.", "GamesBeat: Is it okay to take a real-world inspiration and just fictionalize the name? Grand Theft Auto V got into some trouble with Lindsay Lohan.", "Geffroyd:", " We do have that in the game. I can\u2019t tell you exactly what it is. The legal issues\u2014we\u2019ll see what happens with one or two stories. The False Prophets would be an example. It\u2019s inspired by Project Chanology, which was the first major Anonymous operation. It was a way to give them a little wink. But I promise you we have some pretty funky stuff in there.", "GamesBeat: Did you find that real life was occasionally as good as anything you could invent?", "Geffroyd:", " That\u2019s definitely part of working on Watch Dogs. I\u2019ve worked on a lot of games based on pure fiction, and that\u2019s interesting. Now we try to be as rooted in reality as possible. The world moves so fast. Just looking at the things we did in the first game, everything is progressing at such a speed that we have everything we need. Reality has become entertainment, if you take the right angle. The next step after consuming data, consuming technology is thinking about what it means, and that\u2019s become super exciting.", "Above: DedSec is the hacker group in Watch Dogs 2.", "GamesBeat: What\u2019s your own assessment of how safe smart cities will be? We know they\u2019re going to happen, right?", "Geffroyd:", " I come from a school where anything is hackable. I don\u2019t believe in bulletproof security. Most of my hacker friends have been showing me that it couldn\u2019t be perfectly secure. So I\u2019d say I\u2019m quite worried. Especially because of the lack of regulation.", "The more devices we plug into everything everywhere, the internet of things\u2014all of those devices just become more points of entry. Everything is linked together. As soon as you find a point of entry you have access to the rest. Some friends of mine managed to hack a server using a smart lightbulb. Vendors can sell you processing power if you know how. It\u2019s cheap and it works. There are many ways to get into a system.", "The problem with a smart city is it\u2019s suddenly physical. It\u2019s not just about numbers in your bank account or your personal information. You\u2019re talking about physical impact. That\u2019s something we try to explore in the game.", "GamesBeat: What about the political angle that\u2019s come in as well? We hear a lot about Russian hacking, Chinese hacking, the potential for hacking as warfare.", "Geffroyd:", " We decided not to touch on that too much for now.", "GamesBeat: Watch Dogs 3?", "Geffroyd:", " [", "Laughs", "] Maybe. We tried to let the player experience the city, to have the city as a character. Especially because you can hack it. We wanted it to be very rooted. Going toward cyber-war and all those other elements \u2013 which are fascinating, and we\u2019d love to work with them \u2013 the scale is different. Being in the city poses different problems. We were having so much fun just dealing with the city and making gameplay happen there and making the player feel like they were in this place\u2014it\u2019s going to take some more thinking about how we can integrate a global-scale phenomenon into a more localized setting.", "We\u2019ve been talking about it already. There are ways to do it. But that wasn\u2019t the focus of this game. In Silicon Valley there were enough targets and topics of discussion already. In another product \u2013 books, movies that we\u2019re producing \u2013 we\u2019ll see what happens.", "GamesBeat: Have you heard from anybody important about this? The CEO of Google, the mayor of San Francisco?", "Geffroyd:", " [", "Laughs", "] Not yet. We have other stories, though. I worked on Rainbow Six before. We had some real shenanigans with the mayor of Las Vegas, if you remember. He wasn\u2019t very happy about what we did to his city. But for now, San Francisco has been good to us.", "GamesBeat: We\u2019ll see what happens. Maybe they\u2019ll re-zone Ubisoft headquarters.", "Geffroyd:", " You can visit that in the game, you know. Do you remember the picture that was released from our office, where everyone was dressed exactly the same? Everybody wearing blue? It wound up on Reddit. We had this discussion about having everybody in the Ubisoft building dressed exactly the same. But it turned out they didn\u2019t want that.", "Above: Hacktivist culture is at the center of Watch Dogs 2.", "GamesBeat: Your fiction is very close to the truth here.", "Geffroyd:", " That\u2019s part of the brand. The DNA of Watch Dogs is taking reality and expanding on reality. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve put so much effort into creating the city and working with the hacking community, making sure that everything we put in is right. That\u2019s the service we want to deliver, I would say.", "We live in this world and we have this technology all around us and we don\u2019t really think about it. We can push a little further than reality, show a little more of what we miss every day, show where things are going, and create a discussion. It\u2019s important for us to stay close to reality, because if we don\u2019t do that, if we go too sci-fi, we can\u2019t convey that same message. We can\u2019t comment on your life and the reality of technology. So that\u2019s why we put so much effort in.", "At a basic level, too, it\u2019s interesting to us. These are questions we raise among ourselves. By spending a lot of time with the hacking community, going to cons and everything, we try to stay a step ahead of the discussion. That\u2019s been very interesting. With Watch Dogs, I think the Snowden revelations broke two days before E3. We were right on time. With Watch Dogs 2, dealing with big data and information brokers and those social concerns, the past two or three weeks have seen stories break about data-driven policing and police agencies buying information from shady vendors to target hacktivists and unions.", "By staying so close to reality and so close to the infosec community, we learn all these things that drive us to tell new stories. \u201cThis is amazing. We have to tell people about it.\u201d", "GamesBeat: I thought it was interesting that Mafia III called its city New Bordeaux, even though it\u2019s obviously New Orleans. Grand Theft Auto calls it Los Santos instead of Los Angeles. You guys decided to do the real San Francisco.", "Geffroyd:", " We want to be in reality. The city is real enough that it makes you think about these issues as real, as part of our real world. These other games have fictional cities and so they feel more like fiction. It gets to this idea of being rooted. Whatever we show to players becomes the beginning of questions they ask themselves.", "With the first game, we did some post-launch studies and quantitative analysis of gamers. We had some number of players, around 60 percent, saying that their point of view about technology, and their own behaviors around using technology, was altered by their experience playing Watch Dogs. To us that was a huge victory. Everything else aside, that\u2019s what I want to do. That\u2019s what I work with the team to achieve \u2013 to provide a service, to do something good for people. And also because the themes are just fascinating."]}

In fact, good teams will only become more important as our technology advances.", "Now, admittedly, I didn\u2019t make this point in the most obvious way. In fact, I\u2019m pretty sure I heard the room collectively raise an eyebrow when, on the sixth slide of my presentation, I introduced Jean-Paul Sartre.

At the end of the day, philosophers and coders aren\u2019t nearly as far apart as we like to think.", "Philosophy is abstract, but it deals with one basic issue: people. Philosophers have spent centuries ruminating on the nature of our existence, our perceptions, and our interactions. Part of what they puzzle over is why people are so different. Why don\u2019t we all see the world the same way? And why doesn\u2019t that girl over there always agree with me? What is her experience of the world, and can I even begin to imagine it? These questions \u2014 about human behavior, preference, experience, and fallibility \u2014 are exactly what many coders address when they write programs. How can we improve how people communicate? What human mistakes or blindspots can we fix? Will users like this interface?", "The fact that most people are strange and different from one another makes humans one of the most complicated elements a computer scientist faces when designing software. We humans don\u2019t follow any single rule. There is no one answer for how we will react to software, user interface, or design. What\u2019s more, the code itself, written by humans, it\u2019s a reflection of the people who created it. That means oftentimes our code has blind spots and makes mistakes. Take Google Photos, for example, whose algorithm incorrectly identified an African American woman as a gorilla. That software was written largely by white men (", "Google\u2019s tech team", " is 87 percent male and 57 percent white), and it\u2019s results were skewed by their point of view.", "I brought up Sartre in my talk (as well as de Beauvoir, Hegel, and Said) because people will always remain at the heart of any technology, no matter how sophisticated it is. People use technology, they create technology, and they dictate which technologies succeed and which ones fall by the wayside (anyone still using a Blackberry?).", "So what kind of code do we have right now? Well, mostly we have male code, and we have a lot of code from schools like Stanford and MIT. This code has made huge changes to how we operate and has fundamentally transformed how we live. But what else could it do and how many more problems could it solve if a more diverse group of thinkers were involved in writing it?", "My brief philosophy lesson might have cost me a few listeners \u2014 we were all working outside our comfort zone \u2014 but I used that strategy to prove a point. If we are going to solve the big organizational and systems problems of the future \u2013 problems that will only increase as our technology gets more and more sophisticated \u2013 then we have to be more creative and use a more diversified approach.", "A new approach means bringing in problem-solving skills from other disciplines \u2013 such as psychology and philosophy; it also means elevating the voices of women and people of color, who have different backgrounds from those of the people who have traditionally written code.", "Companies and startups looking to succeed must hire with an emphasis on building teams \u2014 in programming and elsewhere \u2014 that reflect a diversity of problem solving skills. That might mean recruiting from a wider range of schools, writing job descriptions that are equally appealing to men and women, and choosing the most qualified applicant instead of the applicant who is a friend of a friend and likes the same music as you. It also means valuing all the voices at the table. Listen to feedback from coders, but also consider input from your marketing, legal, and HR departments. Bring in as many voices and experiences as possible so that no blind spot remains unexamined and no assumption is left unchallenged.", "Now, more than ever, we need to look beyond the tech industry if we want to create the best tech innovations.

No executive can be expected to know about every minute facet of their business, as well as how to run it.

Jordan ", "prefers the Pixel", ", and Emil prefers the Pixel XL. The only tradeoff between the two is based on size: The screen, dimensions, and battery vary. Everything else is the same, from processor and memory to camera and headphone jack.", "Although the XL is smaller than the Nexus 6P, Emil actually prefers it that way. It\u2019s not that the Nexus 6P ever felt unwieldy, but the XL is closer to that \u201cjust right\u201d size, for Emil. The Pixel XL feels fairly light for its size \u2014 but Jordan notes it\u2019s heavy enough that when you\u2019re using it with one hand, you may worry about dropping it as you reach to the other side of the display. The phone is also not completely flat \u2014 it gets progressively thicker from the bottom to the top. Jordan wishes it were as narrow throughout as it is on the bottom.", "Above: The Google Pixel XL from the side.", "\u00a0", "Jordan finds that the aluminum feels smooth, sturdy, and premium, which is important, given that this phone competes with the well-built iPhone 7. He thinks the glass plate on the back provides contrast and looks sufficiently distinct from other mobile devices. The vibration engine on the phone is not as strong as the one in the iPhone 7, but it still produces a noticeable buzz. The way he sees it, Google should be applauded for making a phone that impresses the second you lay your hand on it.", "Emil finds that the Pixel feels a bit cheap compared to something like the Galaxy S7. While Samsung\u2019s metal design is undeniably solid, Google\u2019s design is flimsier. It\u2019s definitely not a plastic phone, but it doesn\u2019t feel like a completely metal one either. You notice this most when you put it down on a hard surface; the phone doesn\u2019t quite feel like a single slab. Instead, you get the impression that the device has strong and weak points, whereas phones like the S7 definitely don\u2019t. Emil also finds the back ugly. Even at the risk of it looking like many existing phones, he would rather have one color and material throughout.", "On the flip side, the 5.5-inch QHD AMOLED display on the Pixel XL is gorgeous and oh-so-bright. It does well under sunlight, and there\u2019s really nothing to complain about here. At no time of day do you notice any pixels on the screen.", "Above: The Google Assistant on the Google Pixel XL.", "The phone\u2019s single bottom speaker produces sound that\u2019s warm enough, but it could be louder. Jordan noted that if you have to take a call while you\u2019re on a noisy street, you\u2019re going to want to use headphones. Emil found that the sound quality wasn\u2019t top-notch \u2014 playing the same songs on YouTube would sound marginally better on the S7, for example.", "As with the Nexus predecessors, when you receive a notification while the Pixel\u2019s display is off, you\u2019ll see it pop up against a black background, and the colors will only return to the usual lock screen array when you touch the display or raise the phone. It\u2019s nice to see this feature hasn\u2019t been yanked, because it\u2019s not so distracting that you feel the need to stop what you\u2019re doing and react to whatever is new.", "Related to this, there is no LED notification light. As a die-hard BlackBerry user, Emil has always preferred Android phones that include this feature. This isn\u2019t a deal-breaker for most, but you will certainly notice its absence if you\u2019re moving from a phone like the S7 that lets you know at a glance what type of notifications are waiting for you.", "The camera is one of the most important features on a phone nowadays, so it\u2019s not surprising how much time Google spent talking up the one in its Pixel phones. But phone makers are slowly moving to dual cameras, and the Pixel still has only one.", "Above: The rear camera on the Google Pixel XL.", "In our experience, the 12.3-megapixel rear camera is not quite as capable as the dual cameras on the iPhone 7 Plus, for example. The Pixel\u2019s photos aren\u2019t as clear when zoomed in, for one thing \u2014 though they\u2019re still very good. And the camera is versatile \u2014 it picks up tons of detail and gets colors right in natural light. And in low-light situations, with some help from the flash, it can produce good, interesting shots of specific subjects. That is, the camera isn\u2019t useless\u00a0in the dark, unlike Nexus cameras of yore.", "The Google Camera app comes up very quickly (you can fire it up at any point by pressing twice on the power button), and you can take successive photos with minimal delay. This is an improvement over Nexus cameras.", "The biggest advantage of buying a Pixel phone if you take lots of pictures is the option to have them backed up to Google Photos at full resolution. When you go to a desktop computer and bring up your photos, you\u2019ll notice that they take up a few megabytes each, giving you plenty of room for zooming in and cropping.", "Above: A sample photo with the Google Pixel XL.", "These aren\u2019t just photos that look good on your phone\u2019s display. The ability to remotely store photos on Google Photos and move them off the phone as needed \u2014 without sacrificing quality \u2014 means that you can make the most of the 32GB model if you choose it over the 128GB version that costs $100 extra.", "Performance is superb on the Pixel XL, which is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 chip and 4GB of RAM. When you do something, it responds without delay. Swipe up from the bottom? Up the icons come. Swipe down? Down they go, just as fast as they appeared. Swipe down from the top? Here come the notifications. Down again? There are the quick settings. Up? Notifications. Up again? Back to the home screen. Apps open immediately.", "In short, the user interface always responds instantly to your input. This is freeing. But the best part is that unlike some phones, the Pixel XL doesn\u2019t slow down when you\u2019re low on battery.", "Some of this is to be expected. There is the clear advantage of having next to no bundled carrier apps, and there\u2019s also the halo effect of using a new phone. But the latest version of Android really does shine on this device: Everything is very smooth, and in our time using it, we didn\u2019t see it stutter once.", "Above: The Google Pixel XL\u2019s headphone jack.", "The fingerprint sensor is as quick as any we\u2019ve ever seen. To be fair, though, we\u2019re already at the point where fingerprint sensors unlock phones instantaneously, and the variance between different versions isn\u2019t visible to the naked eye. The only real differentiating factor is where the fingerprint sensor is located \u2014 like its predecessors, the Pixel phones have the sensor on the back. This is where the speed gains are obvious over Apple\u2019s and Samsung\u2019s phones: It\u2019s simply faster and easier to open your phone using a sensor on the back than on the front, though it may take a little while to get used to it.", "During certain types of workloads \u2014 like in Google Earth or if you\u2019re simultaneously browsing and watching a long video through Multi-Window Mode \u2014 the phone can heat up, but it doesn\u2019t get too hot to hold. The phone never appears to slow down; it just works harder when you throw a lot at it.", "In just a few days\u2019 testing, battery life on the Pixel XL proved to be very good. During one day of average use, the phone\u2019s battery lasted 17 hours and 30 minutes \u2014 a half hour more than the best that Jordan has seen on the iPhone 7. This is more than Google suggested \u2014 14 hours of internet use over LTE or Wi-Fi. As promised, the phone charges quickly when you\u2019re using the included charger.", "Emil\u2019s findings with the battery were even more positive: 20 hours was completely achievable. But the real test for battery life will be how slowly or quickly it degrades over time. With very intense use, Emil has to charge his S7 once at night and once during the day. While that definitely isn\u2019t the case with the Pixel XL, we\u2019ll have to revisit it to see how things change in a few months\u2019 time.", "When Nexus devices arrive on the market, they immediately have a huge advantage over all other Android options. They\u2019re running the latest software from Google, and they continue to get updates directly from the company. They\u2019re always on the latest version and are first to get it.", "The Pixel phones continue this trend. Although LG technically released the ", "first Android 7.0 Nougat phone", ", the Pixel phones are running Android 7.1 Nougat. They even sound new: There are plenty of new chimes and hums that remind you that you\u2019re using a new device.", "That means small changes to Android \u2014 like accessing all your apps by simply swiping from the bottom up, an intuitive gesture \u2014 are available to Pixel users first. Nougat also brings awesome features like ", "seamless updates", ", though we naturally couldn\u2019t try this one because there weren\u2019t any updates available.", "Above: The dialer on the Google Pixel XL.", "Nougat on the Pixel also means useless features, like the fingerprint swipe option, which brings down the notifications and settings panel when you drag your finger over the fingerprint scanner on the back. While it sounds nifty, and it is a perfect feature to include in a quick demo, Jordan found it annoying (he would bring it down by accident), and Emil just doesn\u2019t see the point of it at all. Thankfully it\u2019s disabled by default, so most users won\u2019t be thrown off by it.", "(For what it\u2019s worth, a Google executive did tell us that it will be possible to use the fingerprint sensor for more than just swiping down your notifications. In a future software update, you\u2019ll be able to use it to scroll through webpages and documents, which, at least on paper, sounds useful.)", "Another currently useless feature is Daydream support. If you\u2019re bullish about VR, it makes sense to buy a new Android phone that supports Google\u2019s upcoming mobile VR platform. But it\u2019s not available just yet \u2014 we will be testing it next month when Google debuts ", "its Daydream VR headset", ".", "Yet another feature that\u2019s currently exclusive to these phones is the Night Light, which tints your screen red and is comforting during later hours. Like Night Shift on iOS, it\u2019s off by default. But once it\u2019s been enabled, it comes on or turns off abruptly, unlike iOS\u2019 gradual fade.", "Nougat also brings circular icons to Android. They look nice, except for the fact that most of your icons are not circular. So they actually look ridiculous:", "This is the top row of Emil\u2019s app icons on the Pixel XL (no, not staged for the review \u2014 these are actually the apps he places on the top).", "Emil decided to swap his apps a little just so that he didn\u2019t have to look at the Google Calendar icon at the very top:", "(It\u2019s not just Google Calendar. Many of Google\u2019s apps don\u2019t have circular icons yet: Gmail, Google Photos, Google Drive, Google Play, Google Play Movies, Google Play Music, Google Camera, YouTube, Android Pay, and the main Google App all remain unchanged.)", "Normally, choices like this don\u2019t bother Emil \u2014 it\u2019s design gurus like our colleague ", "Harrison Weber", " who scoff at Android when they see differently sized icons. But in this case, even Emil is unimpressed.", "Speaking of things that don\u2019t impress Emil, let\u2019s talk about the battery icon. We\u2019re on Android version 7.1 now, and the percentage is still missing. You can thankfully enable this by using the secret System UI Tuner, but it boggles the mind why this isn\u2019t simply turned on for everyone by default.", "Another area where Google has updated app icons is app shortcuts. As you might expect, not many apps offer these shortcuts yet. Those that are available can be quite useful (quickly calling a contact you frequently talk on the phone with, or starting navigation to your work/home).", "The Pixels also have the ability to search within apps installed on the device, a feature that was first made available on the LG V20. To access it, simply bring up the Google search box, execute a search, and then swipe right to the In Apps header. This section brings up good results for some queries but comes up short for others. (For example, Jordan saved an article about Leonard Cohen in his Pocket app, but there were no search results from Pocket in the In Apps section when he searched for \u201cleonard cohen.\u201d)", "Pixel and Pixel XL also offer access to Google\u2019s support team via chat or phone, available 24/7. Emil requested a chat, asking for help transferring text messages to the Pixel XL. A support agent was available in less than a minute and was very helpful. Emil only experienced one annoyance: There\u2019s an option to describe your issue when you\u2019re requesting help, but filling it out is pointless, because the support agent apparently doesn\u2019t see it and still asks what you want help with.", "The Pixel launcher has two features that make it stand out from the Nexus launcher it replaces. It has a \u201cG\u201d logo that lets you jump straight into Google Search. We found the trending topics to be a nice touch and noted that it might end up being yet another way to quickly check the news, much like Facebook\u2019s trending topics section.", "There\u2019s also a weather section that constantly updates you on the current conditions (Emil, who lives in Canada, was awestruck that it was in Celsius without his having to change anything). Opening it gives you all the details you need. It\u2019s quite handy and honestly makes us wonder if most people will want to use a separate weather app ever again.", "But the big draw in the Pixel launcher is, of course, Google\u2019s latest answer to Apple\u2019s Siri and Microsoft\u2019s Cortana.", "Google Assistant is the single most important feature of the Pixel phones. It\u2019s Google\u2019s latest, most fleshed-out attempt to make a virtual assistant. While the responses are not always what you\u2019re looking for, it tends to understand what you\u2019re saying more frequently than Siri. (See Jordan\u2019s in-depth post on the Assistant ", "here", ".)", "What makes Assistant particularly useful on the Pixel phones is that you can trigger it at any time. Just say \u201cOK Google,\u201d regardless of what you\u2019re doing or what app you have open. In fact, you can use the phrase to unlock your phone and trigger the Assistant \u2014 thanks to the Trusted Voice feature, which ensures nobody else near your phone can gain access by simply saying \u201cOK Google.\u201d Emil asked friends and family to try to unlock his phone with the phrase, and while nobody could, when he tried it immediately afterward, he couldn\u2019t either. Waiting a bit resolved the issue.", "Assistant is actually voice-only. You can\u2019t type questions into it when you\u2019re trying to be quiet at night or are in public and don\u2019t want to look dumb talking to your phone. If you want to type, you\u2019ll have to communicate with the Assistant in Allo, a decision Google may want to change in the future.", "When you ask something of Assistant, it quickly figures out what you said and then provides its best answer. The speech recognition alone is impressive. When Assistant is done, you can just ask another question. And then another. It\u2019s fun and addictive.", "Above: The Google Assistant on the Google Pixel XL.", "Emil wanted to know how late a barbecue place was open, but didn\u2019t know its name. When simply told \u201cbarbecue restaurant\u201d and the intersection,\u00a0Google Assistant brought up two results. Emil followed up by asking how late the first result was open \u00a0\u2014 Assistant immediately gave the hours and said it would only be open for 35 more minutes. Tasks like this normally take a lot more time when you have to manually search around the web.", "One of the most interesting things Jordan discovered about the Assistant is that it can take a picture at your command. Just for fun, while driving, he said, \u201cTake a picture.\u201d The Pixel was mounted in a holder that\u2019s stuck to an air conditioner vent, but the rear camera was located just high enough that it could see what was in front of the car. It counted down \u201c3, 2, 1,\u201d and then took a shot. Even though it was dark, the picture didn\u2019t look all that bad. But it was just thrilling that it worked without a hitch. Trying this on an iPhone resulted in Siri bringing up the Camera app and not going any further.", "But the feature still has a long way to go. For example, Assistant still can\u2019t recognize music, so asking it what song is playing doesn\u2019t do anything. It also opens websites in Android\u2019s WebView instead of Chrome, which can be quite frustrating, as you can\u2019t keep the page open and switch back to Assistant. If you tell it to \u201ctake me\u201d to a website, it will launch Google Maps instead of Chrome (you have to say \u201copen\u201d instead) \u2014 it has trouble distinguishing between certain entities. Assistant also doesn\u2019t always take your location into account when opening sites. So if a more popular restaurant across the world has a name that\u2019s similar to your local place, you\u2019ll end up on the wrong site \u2014 a common problem with Google Search that Assistant inevitably inherits.", "All in all, even with its odd quirks, Assistant is simply faster to use for many of the things that you normally would ask Google for. If you need to quickly check something while you\u2019re shopping, getting groceries, or trying to figure out if a restaurant is open \u2014 simply asking your phone verbally is much easier than navigating to Google Search and typing out a query.", "The Nexus phones were often the best Android phones you could get on a budget. There were exceptions, of course, but generally speaking, you were basically saving a few hundred dollars to get an unlocked Android phone that would get software updates first.", "With the Pixels, it seems like the tradeoff is much better, but it will cost you accordingly. This is currently the best Android phone on the market. As is often the case with Android, that will likely change in half a year, when Samsung and its competitors start releasing their latest. But for now, if you have the money to get the latest and greatest, you can\u2019t go wrong with the Pixel and Pixel XL."]}

HP \u2014 that was even before the split, and they kept working with\u00a0Anaplan after they split into two companies \u2014 we solved a huge problem for\u00a0them, which was how to allocate their sales targets across their entire sales\u00a0force. Their sales force is 25,000 sales reps around the world, 200 counties.\u00a0We were talking about 200,000 sales territories that they were managing.\u00a0Before, it took them four months, four to five months, between the moment\u00a0the process starts where we have the big sales targets and the time the sales rep\u00a0in every country receives the letter that tells him, okay you need to sell this\u00a0product with this discount \u2014 four to five months.", "This was a huge risk for them.\u00a0They moved to Anaplan about three years ago. In about five months \u2014 that was\u00a0the time of the project \u2014 we moved this five months to a week, sometimes a few days. So the result was they set the target at a high level and after one week, everybody, every sales rep around the world, received his compensation letter.\u00a0So they know what to sell and at what discount.

That was the big change, the big win for them.", "VB: So now I open this up to everybody on the panel, but how far are we going to\u00a0go with this kind of decision support in real time? Where are we now with it in\u00a0the CEO suite? Is the CEO going to have all these instrumented dashboards\u00a0that are just going to help them out and get them the things they need to know\u00a0right when they need to know it?", "Jim McNiel:", "\u00a0I think what you\u2019re hearing today is that there are really three\u00a0categories of artificial intelligence. There\u2019s artificial narrow intelligence,\u00a0general intelligence and super intelligence. Today you\u2019re hearing about really\u00a0the growth and transitioning from the slow growth phase into maybe the\u00a0accelerated phase of A&amp;I. It\u2019s demonstrated by things like predictive\u00a0forecasting for sales teams. It\u2019s demonstrated by Siri. It\u2019s demonstrated by the\u00a0autonomous car. It\u2019s demonstrated by the Nest\u00a0thermostat. So we\u2019re at the\u00a0very early days of narrow applications of machine learning and artificial\u00a0intelligence.", "I think that what you\u2019re going to find is that in any kind of specific category\u00a0where you can frame a problem you can bring predictive algorithms; you can\u00a0bring machine learning; you can bring neural networking. Any number of\u00a0different technologies together to do things more efficiently than humans can\u00a0do it just by the sheer fact that you can crunch the numbers \u2013 that we now have\u00a0computers on the planet that are stronger than the human brain. Not many, just\u00a0one, but still it\u2019s happening.", "So I think the answer is it\u2019s going to happen. It\u2019s going to happen in an area\u00a0where the investment justifies the return. It\u2019s not going to stop. What I think I\u00a0care about as an agent for NetScout is that the quality of the work that you\u2019re\u00a0doing in terms of crunching numbers and trying to make decisions faster than\u00a0humans and better than humans, is going to depend on the quality of the data.\u00a0You know, we all learned in CIS 101, garbage in garbage out. So if you want\u00a0to be able to make good decisions, you\u2019d better start with good data. The\u00a0business that we\u2019re in at NetScout is collecting organising and analysing that\u00a0data and making it available to people like Guillaume to analyse what\u2019s going\u00a0on in large enterprise.", "Above: Real A.I.? It is not needed for chatbots.", "Rob Pickering:\u00a0", "The issue with data, and getting good data, is that that\u2019s always going to rely on\u00a0people. People are making those determinations as to what is \u00a0quality data and\u00a0what isn\u2019t quality data. Then you can teach machines to identify quality data\u00a0over time. But as we heard this morning that\u2019s difficult. That requires an\u00a0enormous data set in order to provide that training to those A.I.s. So that \u2013 I\u00a0agreed with Kathryn this morning \u2013 we\u2019re at the very very early stages in this\u00a0A.I. growth curve. If you look at all of the companies that are starting in the\u00a0Valley and in elsewhere \u2013 Jason Calacanis does a launch ticker newsletter \u2013\u00a0you\u2019re seeing five, six, eight A.I. companies starting every week.

It\u2019s a 360 degree horizon that you are looking. To the extent that the data\u00a0which is correct arrives, the next thing you\u2019ve got to do is correlation.", "Correlation is that if there is an action, what is the reaction? Is there a way you\u00a0can simplify the path to action to reaction thanks to A.I.? I think in the areas of\u00a0narrow problems as Jim mentioned, we will see the help of A.I. coming to\u00a0rescue some of the decisions that the CEOs have to make.\u00a0To the extent that these some of narrow A.I. technologies create a global\u00a0consciousness in the mind of the CEO, the C-suite, then we can see whether\u00a0A.I. does or is not going to help. The challenge with science fiction is that we\u00a0treat A.I. like we treat ourselves. We think that \u2013 we project our qualities and flaws into the A.I. that we are building but we have no idea once A.I. gains\u00a0consciousness whether they like our qualities and flaws and to what decision\u00a0they\u2019re going to make.", "Jim McNiel:", "\u00a0You had to go there huh?\u00a0[Laughter]", "David Gurle:\u00a0", "Right? What decision they\u2019re going to make. In the world of the CEO there is a\u00a0lot of rational decision but there is also a good chunk of emotional decision.", "Sometimes a decision that you have to make from a strategic perspective is\u00a0driven more about keeping your team together than actually making the result\u00a0that could be the most rational thing to do. To what extent AI is going to be\u00a0helping around that I have no clue but I\u2019m not ready to give that up yet.", "Guillaume Arnaud:", " It helps for sure. It helps doing a lot of the automation and the legwork. So\u00a0what we see with our big customers \u2013 HP is one of them and we have many\u00a0others \u2013 is when the whole system manages this whole set of data aggregates\u00a0and gives the trends of what\u2019s happening, then you free up a lot of time for the\u00a0decision-makers to actually try things based on what happened in the past and\u00a0see what the result will be. Like the action reaction you just talked about. We\u00a0see that very very often with our customers. That\u2019s the beauty of those\u00a0platforms. I mean like Anaplan is \u2013 that we empower these people to leverage\u00a0these big data sets, leverage these very complex calculations, the predictive of\u00a0it, and try things and see what the result will be before they make the decision.", "So A.I. will not replace people from making those decisions because the\u00a0intuition of the business person has still to be here. The A.I. and the automation\u00a0free up from the legwork and empowers them to make those simulations, those\u00a0what-ifs, compare. If I do this what\u2019s going to happen? If I do that what\u2019s going\u00a0to happen? Hey what do you think here in this department? If I do this \u2013\u00a0because this is impacting you \u2013 so the collaboration combined with the A.I. combined with some predictive, this is where we are going to make so much\u00a0progress and empower those business people to make those smart decisions.", "Above: Bill Gates. Credit: OnInnovation", "Jim McNiel:", "\u00a0That supports Bill Gates\u2019 vision of business at the speed of thought. His notion\u00a0was first it was information at your fingertips. Now it\u2019s intelligence at your\u00a0fingertips. So everything comes in. So that I can make a decision I can have all\u00a0the information about all of my sales, all my investment, what the results of\u00a0those investments are and I can make better decisions faster. I think as long as\u00a0this conversation takes place in that kind of narrow space which is, how do I\u00a0monetize this opportunity or how do I improve this performance? It\u2019s a very\u00a0bounded, very reasonable conversation.", "I think when A.I. becomes much broader and we get to artificial general\u00a0intelligence then it becomes a free for all. Then it gets very scary to a lot of\u00a0people very quickly. But for A.I., artificial \u2013 neural intelligence \u2013 I think it\u00a0comes down to framing the problem, understanding what you want to solve\u00a0and how you want to improve it. There are so many different companies out\u00a0there that can help us do that. In the case of a service provider one of the\u00a0things that we\u2019ve done with the analytics that we provide is service providers\u00a0are all stressed to figure out how to find new revenue sources.", "One way in which to do that is to look at the patterns of all of us as mobile\u00a0users and just to solve a simple problem which is to say is Rob currently at\u00a0Home Depot with his credit card spending $1000? Because his credit card is\u00a0there but is Rob there? That\u2019s a really easy thing for AT&amp;T to solve. So this is\u00a0a way some of this stuff could be used to make revenue opportunities for new\u00a0companies.", "VB: It seems like things are changing fast. I wonder how fast they\u2019re going to\u00a0change on this particular topic and that is your quarterly reports, you know\u00a0public companies. Every quarter we see them either spike in their stock price\u00a0or just crash in their stock price because they didn\u2019t properly warn Wall Street\u00a0about how things were going to go. So every 90 days they\u2019re getting this\u00a0information back telling them how well the company is doing. That seems so\u00a0archaic in this day and age of what we\u2019re talking about here. In real time on\u00a0day 23 of the quarter you should know whether you\u2019re going to hit it or not. So\u00a0why are we on this 90 day cadence still and failing to actually really predict it?", "David Gurle:", "\u00a0I think that is \u2013 it\u2019s an auto-forecast. I think the whole point of quarterly\u00a0reporting is not questioning the result. It\u2019s questioning the forecast. So to the\u00a0extent that, again the CFO and CEO have the data that supports the future\u00a0revenue and future EBITDA based on the past performance and to the extent\u00a0that they can project that 90, 120 and 360 days ahead you can be very\u00a0successful with Wall Street. Wall Street just does not want you to fail on your\u00a0forecast on whatever model that they believe that your model is going to be.", "This is where A.I. can be very helpful because there is always a degree of\u00a0uncertainty when it comes to forecasting your results. We all know that.\u00a0Things that [we are going to] close this quarter is just pushed to the next\u00a0quarter. What we don\u2019t know most of the time \u2013 I do it every day \u2013 is that what \u00a0is it that\u2019s causing that delay to happen? Therefore how do we predict that the\u00a0next five things that have to close this quarter will not close next quarter?", "Above: One of the Bee Cave\u2019s virtual slot machines.", "Rob Pickering:", "\u00a0I think it applies to the law of large numbers. This is an easier conversation if\u00a0you\u2019re Apple or HP. It\u2019s a tougher conversation is you\u2019re a $5 million software\u00a0start-up who doesn\u2019t have bookings coming into the quarter; doesn\u2019t have a large number of customers to rely upon. It\u2019s like predicting the performance of\u00a0five slot machines versus 500 slot machines. So you need to be able to\u00a0appropriate \u2013 have the appropriate scale of data to be able to make these kinds\u00a0of decisions.", "Jim McNiel:", " It also boils down to people. People are creating that data. They\u2019re making\u00a0those forecasts. They\u2019re actually putting in their sales as they\u2019re making them. Those companies all know what they\u2019re quarter looks like long before the\u00a0quarter ends. They have that data already. What you\u2019re going to see is you\u2019re\u00a0going to see a shift for the CEO to be able to make more valuable decisions in the\u00a0long term. So all of those tiny point decisions are going to get made by the\u00a0company as a whole or by a machine learning inside the company. To move it\u00a0forward the CEOs are going to make the emotional decisions, the \u00a0strategic\u00a0decisions. Their A.I. is not going to change what they\u2019re doing. It\u2019s going to\u00a0make what they\u2019re doing more valuable.", "Rob Pickering:", " When is the leading indicator not the sales forecast? That\u2019s what\u2019s interesting.\u00a0If you look at the volume of network traffic, if you look at the number of visits\u00a0to the site, if you look at the downloads, if you look at just everything in its\u00a0aggregate and it doesn\u2019t actually rely on the salesperson predicting \u2013 because\u00a0they\u2019re always bad at it \u2013 it\u2019s an interesting conversation.", "Jim McNiel:\u00a0", "Absolutely right. That\u2019s where IOT starts to play. That\u2019s where you\u2019re\u00a0gathering data about the performance of the company from the company itself,\u00a0not from the people in the company.", "Rob Pickering:", "\u00a0In total, yeah.", "David Gurle:", "\u00a0That\u2019s where connecting the high level aggregated decisions to what\u2019s\u00a0happening in the field in real time is so critical. Those algorithms and those\u00a0hardware makes that possible now. The value of that is just incredible because\u00a0as you said you know what\u2019s going to happen at the end of the quarter before\u00a0the end of the quarter. So what you can do is course-correct. If you know\u00a0you\u2019re going to miss your quarter you\u2019re going to minimise the impact. If you\u00a0know you\u2019re going to explode your quarter you\u2019re going to start making some\u00a0noise about it. So those real time platforms combined with A.I. provides this\u00a0ability to make a change.

See if anybody has one.", "Question:\u00a0", "Joscelyn Flores from HPC Review in Paris. I\u2019d like to give the example of HP.\u00a0I think the example you gave was more at the operational level. I think if you\u00a0keep the example of HP which is interesting, if you go one level up, like the\u00a0strategic level, CEOs don\u2019t take strategic decisions every day. I mean they take\u00a0many one or two during their whole career.\u00a0If you keep the example for HP, like 15 years go for HP bigger was the best,\u00a0they need to be a bigger and bigger company. Today the thing \u2013 the strategic\u00a0decision is to keep focused on the data centre infrastructure. So do you think at\u00a0that level of decision A.I., data analysis and everything will be interesting to\u00a0apply? Do you think we will still stay at the level of [rule of thumb], intuition\u00a0and all that \u2013 humans are very able to do it, not the computer [are not able to\u00a0do it]?", "Guillaume Arnaud:", "\u00a0That was a long question. As we discussed, and I agree with the people here,\u00a0it\u2019s a combination of automation, artificial intelligence and intuition. So the\u00a0automation, the big data processing, the management of these business roles in\u00a0a very complex situation like HP, to the service of the intuition of the business\u00a0manager. So in order to make smart strategic decisions you need to have the\u00a0insight. You need to know what\u2019s going on. What will happen if I take that\u00a0decision versus this decision? If you don\u2019t have all this data, if you don\u2019t have\u00a0all this collaboration between all your different departments it\u2019s likely you\u2019re\u00a0going to make a wrong decision.", "You might be lucky because you have a crazy great intuition but you\u2019re blind if\u00a0you don\u2019t see that. So if we combine those data, these calculations, this hyper\u00a0speed processing at the service of those smarts decisions, that\u2019s where you become successful and you lower your risk of making a wrong decision. If you\u00a0take the example of HP but \u2013 there is another example of a customer in the\u00a0wine and spirits here in the United States.", "It\u2019s big. They have $1 billion in marketing to spend every year. They need to\u00a0spend very carefully because the competition is intense. They need to sell the\u00a0right bottle at the right size at the right place. So in order to make this decision\u00a0they need to have this algorithm, this predictive algorithm, the collaboration of\u00a0people in the field to tell them this is the brand that is successful, that will be\u00a0successful in this size because this is what\u2019s happening here in this location.\u00a0This is across the world, across \u2013 in all the different places they are selling\u00a0their products to. So if you apply this processing, this big data, and connect the smart strategic decision to the operational decision in the field you will lower\u00a0your risk of failing in your strategic decisions.", "Jim McNiel:\u00a0", "So Guillaume if a Google car crashes is it your fault?\u00a0[Laughter].\u00a0If that CEO chooses your software and makes a decision and he fails, does he\u00a0get fired?", "VB: \u00a0We\u2019ve got a question over here. Go ahead.", "Question:", "\u00a0Sathya Atreyam from IDC from USA. A question for Jim \u2013 actually you\u00a0brought up a very fantastic point of Home Depot where the mobile service\u00a0providers actually get to know the whole picture versus the credit card.\u00a0NetScout is rightly placed with enterprises and service providers. The question\u00a0is how much friction do you see on the business side of things where they have\u00a0to share data in order to achieve the scenario which you mentioned, to know\u00a0that Jim actually was the one using the credit card?", "Jim McNiel:\u00a0", "That\u2019s an excellent question. The answer is they\u2019re not doing it. American\u00a0Express, Discover Card, MasterCard, all of these banking interests could\u00a0happily pay, I don\u2019t know, ten cents per transaction of over $100 to ensure that\u00a0it was actually you holding your credit card. But in order to do that Verizon,\u00a0T-Mobile and Sprint and all the American cell carriers have to agree on\u00a0sharing the data. Because American Express is not going to send a [restful]\u00a0API out to five or six different vendors. It\u2019s just not going to happen. So a lot\u00a0of these problems can be solved. But we need collaboration and we need co-operation amongst these parties.", "Then of course if you take this conversation into foreign markets like into\u00a0Europe there may be governmental restrictions on the fact that you can\u2019t do it\u00a0because you can\u2019t share that kind of user data. But I think that to a certain\u00a0degree we have now the compute power. We have the bandwidth. We have the\u00a0software that\u2019s smart enough to learn and make decisions. The real question is\u00a0what problems are we going to solve in the near term? We can solve these\u00a0problems but companies do have to work together.", "Rob Pickering:", "\u00a0We also need the co-operation of the end user as well.

The top-down view gives you a sweeping view of the battlefield. The graphics weren\u2019t super-realistic, but they did the job. It was like running around in an intense 3D cartoon battle. \u2014 Dean Takahashi", "Above: Kingspray is a graffiti game in VR.", "Kingspray is a graffiti simulator that turns the Touch controllers into versatile cans of paint. You can adjust how big the spray is, the color, the tone of that color, and more as you travel to different environments to unleash your colorful creations.", "Our take:\u00a0", "It\u2019s an impressive creative tool, especially when you consider that developer Infectious Ape is made up of four people who are working on Kingspray in their spare time. I don\u2019t have the best artistic skills, so some of the nuance and realism of virtual graffiti art is lost on me. But the person I played with in the multiplayer mode had no problem coming up with fantastic designs in a short amount of time.\u00a0\u2014 Giancarlo Valdes", "This game did a great job of making me feel like I was using spray paint, mostly because of the sound. \u2014 Dean Takahashi", "Above: The Unspoken is a spell dueling game.", "Insomniac is building a game that pits two wizards against each other, dueling in a city while standing on pillars or platforms. You can play one human player against another, using the Touch controller. You can play an Anarchist or a Kineticist. The Anarchist can throw fireballs or flaming skulls or molten spears at the other person. You can also raise a shield or create spells with more elaborate objects using various hand movements. The Anarchist can rain rockets down on a rival, but the Kineticist can drop a car on the enemy\u2019s head.", "Our take:", " This game was a hoot. I had to remember how to do various spells very quickly before my opponent caught me off guard or tossed an elaborate spell my way. I lost two matches, but just barely as the enemy got off a final spell before I was able to hit back. \u2014 Dean Takahashi", "Above: VR Sports", "Sanzaru Games\u2019 VR Sports is like one big highlight reel of the best moments in baseball, basketball, football, and hockey. Instead of making you play through long matches for each activity, VR Sports (releasing the same day as the Oculus Touch motion controllers) immediately drops you in key situations.", "In basketball, for instance, you\u2019ll take control when you\u2019re near the opposing team\u2019s hoop \u2014 you can pass the ball to a teammate or attempt to take the shot. When you pass, your perspective changes to the person you passed it to, and time slows down so you can get ready to grab the basketball.And when the other team tries to take a shot, you can try to knock the ball out of the air and into big targets for extra points.", "Our take:", "\u00a0Some of the mini-games take that silliness a step further \u2014 in one football mode, I had to catch as many balls as I could while also swatting down cartoonish bombs. VR Sports isn\u2019t very realistic, but that\u2019s one of the reasons why it\u2019s so fun to play. \u2014 Giancarlo Valdes", "Above: I Expect You To Die", "Schell Games is making this funny title that riffs on the famous quote from the film Goldfinger, where agent 007 James Bond says, \u201cDo you expect me to talk?\u201d And Goldfinger replies, \u201cNo, Mr. Bond. I expect you to die.\u201d You sit in a chair and reach out with your hands to pick things up or shoot things or move them across the room. With these Touch-based movements, you have to solve puzzles, like how to steal a car from the back of a cargo plane and drive it out the bay door while it\u2019s in mid-air. There are four missions in the game so far.", "Our take:", " I tried to do this, but every time I thought I was solving a life-threatening problem, another thing popped up to doom me. I had to disarm a bomb in the car, but I didn\u2019t do it in the right sequence and it exploded \u2014 several times as I tried over and over. It\u2019s hilarious. \u2014 Dean Takahashi", "Above: Lone Echo", "Lone Echo is set in outer space, where you use the Oculus Touch controls to make yourself move in a zero gravity environment. You press buttons to operate thrusters, and use the triggers to grab on to rails and other things. If you push yourself from one ledge, you\u2019ll propel through space until you catch something. If you overshoot, you can use your thrusters. Once you learn how to move this way, you can start performing missions as an android working for the humans in the space station. And when that starts, you\u2019ll find there\u2019s a story to go with it.", "Our take:", " Lone Echo really nails what it\u2019s like to move around in space, at least as far as I have imagined it by watching films like ", "Gravity", ". You don\u2019t get motion sickness while moving around because the developers at Ready At Dawn Studios figured out that when you reach out to grab something with the Touch device, your head matches and grasps that movement. It\u2019s also got a riveting story as the humans and androids try to work together to solve real-time problems on a space station. \u2014 Dean Takahashi", "Above: Killing Floor", "For the VR version of the popular first-person shooter series, developer Tripwire Interactive opted for a story-driven survival-horror approach.", "Our take:", " The gory, fast-paced action of the past Killing Floor games never interested me, but the Oculus Rift spin-off (coming out in 2017) looks promising because it\u2019s a completely different beast. In the demo, I played with a Tripwire employee in cooperative multiplayer as we fought through a horde of zombies to reach an abandoned house on a hill. The rickety home showed off Killing Floor\u2019s slower pacing: We briefly put away our guns and brought out our flashlights so we could look for the missing pieces of a portal.", "The puzzle reminded me of Capcom\u2019s older Resident Evil games, which also struck a balance between puzzle solving and combat. Killing Floor even has a grand mystery to solve as you kill every ugly monster that gets in your way. \u2014 Giancarlo Valdes", "Above: The developers of Harmonix\u2019s SingSpace karaoke game in VR.", "Coming exclusively to the Samsung Gear VR in 2017, SingSpace is a karaoke game from Rock Band developer Harmonix. According to product manager Jessa Brezinski, the studio wanted to create a \u201csocial karaoke experience\u201d where you can hang out with friends or strangers online in virtual bars and private karaoke rooms. You can even chat with people (through your customizable avatar) while waiting for the next person to take the stage.", "Our take:", " Singing in karaoke bars in real life can be a terrifying experience if you\u2019re not used to the spotlight. But SingSpace makes it a little easier with its cast of happy cartoon characters.", "Harmonix is still figuring out which songs to include, but judging from our demo \u2014 Dean belted out a beautiful rendition of \u201cI Will Survive\u201d while I butchered most of Sia\u2019s \u201cCheap Thrills\u201d \u2014 it seems like SingSpace will have a good mix of old and new tracks.\u00a0\u2013Giancarlo Valdes", "I learned that Giancarlo is equally bad at singing as I am.

The inventory is never more than a second out of date, the company says.", "Griffith got the idea for the company a while ago, when he and his brother were trying to buy last-minute tickets for a San Francisco Giants game. They were at a bar and realized they had to print the tickets. They talked to the bartender and got permission to go to the office and print the tickets. But they accidentally printed in color, so the process took extra time, even though all they really needed was a barcode or QR code. After all that, they arrived late to the ballpark. To solve this problem, they decided to create an app, and Griffith founded Gametime in 2012.", "When you try to buy a ticket at a participating venue, Gametime will make some calculations and surface the 50 best tickets that people are selling. It takes into account the price of the ticket and the quality of the view from the seat. With this automated process, the fan no longer has to wade through thousands of tickets and\u00a0can get an image of the view from the seat before purchasing. Gametime takes a small piece of the overall transaction."]}

A startup\u2019s earliest employees and founders, many of whom may have options strike prices in the pennies, will feel a hit in a down round, but there\u2019s still very obvious upside, because even if a per-share value falls, their strike price is virtually nil.

Momentum tells investors, employees and the media that they\u2019ve done right to invest in, join or write about your startup. But a down round, even if some other metrics are moving up, kills the momentum story. This often has a long term impact on a startup\u2019s ability to raise capital or attract talent in the future, even if the company is performing well.

When raising money in a down round, a different kind of venture capital investor can arrive \u2014 one that is focused more on a one-sided deal than a mutually beneficial partnership. This is not necessarily a bad partner; it\u2019s just different. And your expectations of this type of investor should be different.", "You may be replaced.", " This is a sad reality, as no one cares about a startup as much as its founder. But many of the best startup concepts have failed for execution purposes, and sometimes that means investors need to right the ship with a new executive team. In other cases, a founder\u2019s dilution in a down round may have new investors wondering if that individual still has sufficient skin in the game. For either reason, unless you\u2019re at a very late stage, you\u2019re probably going to remain a significant shareholder, so your goal should always be the company\u2019s long-term success. This doesn\u2019t mean you should roll over if you feel you are the best choice to lead the company, but getting a seasoned executive may be the best option in the long term.", "You\u2019ll start talking to the board a lot more.", " This is perhaps the least surprising result of all. During times of trouble, your board will be paying closer attention to the daily ins and outs of the business, inserting themselves into more decisions than ever before. Depending on how well you\u2019ve chosen your investors, this can be a big positive of a down round, focusing a highly experienced group that might have been under-utilized before.", "There\u2019s no way around it. Down rounds are frustrating, and they can bring big changes to the founder\u2019s life. They can be demoralizing to you and your team. They can lessen the financial upside of your idea and your hard work.

Mark, we know you\u2019re super active in the VR industry. You\u2019ve had your voice published on several sites. What trends are you seeing in the adoption and the data? How can the investors here leverage that knowledge to increase their probability of a high return?", "Mark Linao:", " Some of the things I\u2019m tracking \u2014 I\u2019m trying to take a very bird\u2019s-eye view of how VR is being adopted. I can talk about a few things I\u2019m looking at right now. We all know marketing \u2014 there\u2019s something there. Brands are spending money. No one knows how much, but we\u2019ll say it\u2019s big money. I\u2019m taking some data points on how brands are using VR, what platforms they\u2019re advertising through, and what budgets they\u2019re putting toward that. A thing I don\u2019t know is, we don\u2019t have marketing ROI now. But the reason I look at that is because it will be big. People are advertising as much as you would think.", "If you\u2019ve followed anything about marketing technology in the past, companies like SalesForce did really well because marketers were using CRMs to sell more. That was the basis of their business. That\u2019s one thing I\u2019m looking at.", "The next thing I\u2019ll say, looking a lot at what the activity is in Steam \u2014 less people have the Vive consumer edition. Looking at what\u2019s going on in terms of gaming and whatever else is shipping on the Steam platform, what genres are people engaging in? Are there opportunities for more genres, different genres? It\u2019s interesting to see HTC trying to monetize non-gaming content. That\u2019s another way I\u2019m trying to look at data in the VR space.", "There\u2019s also a lot of data there against play time and how much time people are spending in VR. Someone mentioned that they\u2019re spending an hour a day in VR. I\u2019m curious about how much time people are really spending in VR. NBC recently mentioned that they\u2019re going to be streaming 85 hours worth of Olympic Games content. That\u2019s for the Samsung Gear. For me, the question is, how many people are actually looking at that content, and how much?", "I\u2019m not saying that this isn\u2019t a good time to invest. By the time VR is already adopted by a billion users, it\u2019s going to be too late. The opportunities won\u2019t be there.", "Above: The Oculus Rift.", "We\u2019re all looking from an investment standpoint at VR and AR. If you look at the acquirers in the space and the investors and the space, you\u2019ll notice that in the early days, the Oculus \u2014 Oculus first started this revolution. Around the time they were acquired by Facebook, the investors in the space were looking mainly at technology companies. Fast forward to now, we\u2019re seeing Disney and Fox and the other studios that Technicolor services investing in the space. As well as Technicolor itself and our competitors. It\u2019s an important piece of data, to know who will be potentially buying you or your companies, giving you those awesome exits.", "Freeman:", " Comparing the Bay Area, which seems to be more tech-focused, to Los Angeles and more the creative content scene \u2014 looking at the difference in the investors and the expectations going into it, I\u2019d be curious to hear your thoughts on who the major investment players are in that area. You mentioned Fox and Disney getting in. What are their real intentions? What should investors and founders be thinking about when they enter that market?", "Linao:", " Let\u2019s start off with financial investors, talking about activity in the venture space in L.A. first. We have Greycroft. Upfront recently added a new partner in Los Angeles. Also, there are a few seed funds out there who have invested in VR companies. Prospect is one smaller seed fund in Los Angeles.", "A lot of what\u2019s going on now in terms of investment \u2014 yes, L.A. is definitely looking. Are they looking for content to invest in? Yes and no. There\u2019s a lot of pressure for L.A. investors to be investing in technology for VR. Not just VR content. There\u2019s a lot of interest in marketing technology and ad tech. That\u2019s in our DNA. How do we invest in the OTT space? What\u2019s the next content consumption platform? You\u2019ve got Wevr and other companies trying to be the solution for 360 video content. Those are some signs that I\u2019m seeing.", "Freeman:", " Now we have Marc Jackson, an accomplished professional in the game industry. He\u2019s been fostering the VR scene in L.A. Marc, we know you used to carry more than $150 million for traditional video games, specifically around independent publishing. Now you\u2019re looking at reinvesting in the content creation business in VR. How are you thinking about that? What are the opportunities and the key learnings from prior platforms? How are the content creators of today capitalizing on this next wave?", "Above: There was a long line to try out the Oculus Rift at CES 2016.", "Marc Jackson:", " I\u2019m flattered to be here among a primarily equity- and tech-focused crowd. I\u2019m relatively new to equity investing myself, having spent most of my career assisting independent interactive developers and creators to find access to project financing, capital that comes not through equity but through other sources.", "One of the most telling experiences I had \u2014 I started my career more than 20 years ago. I was with Walt Disney Imaginarium. I had the amazing opportunity to work as a junior project manager on the Euro Disney park. That experience is coming back now in VR. In video games I started with a publisher called Infogrames, which later became Atari, and moved to L.A. with them.", "I eventually set up a company around a very talented team of software engineers, designers, and artists who were coming out of the Sony Imagesoft studios in Santa Monica, people who\u2019d created content for the first PlayStation. With that company, where I eventually became the CEO, we tried to raise capital ahead of time, and it was absolutely impossible to get venture capital. We ended up having to bootstrap and raise funds through selling our designs to publishers. My experience was very specific to that problem \u2014 being a content creator and seeing the difficulty the venture capital community had with evaluating the potential return, always bumping up against the hit list.", "I can make a couple of quick observations. Both Hollywood, which I\u2019ve been close to for a long time, and the Bay Area, where I\u2019ve spent a lot of my time dealing with video game publishers \u2014 the community around financing films and the community around financing tech companies have a very difficult time understanding what interactive entertainment is. Interactive entertainment, for a very long time, has been a key storytelling medium. I think of game design and interactive entertainment as very often being a business model in itself. Some designers are so talented that they can come up with ways of engaging consumers. We\u2019ve seen this in the mobile revolution. You can design around a specific engagement application that brings in consumers in ways that surround them with story, but also engage them and make them part of the storyteller\u2019s vision.", "I say all that because what I later did after I ran a game development company was I transitioned into a support mode. I began applying film project finance methods to video game productions. Always with independent studios that were looking to receive funding based on getting a publisher to agree with their original design and fund it through third-party bank financing and other types of specialized funding, which is typical of the film industry. In fact that\u2019s very much the norm in film and television, for decades, to fund through what\u2019s called negative pickup deals, or structured project finance.", "Above: The HTC Vive virtual reality headset with hand controls and sensors.", "I began as one of a couple pioneers in the game industry, applying those methods in the early 2000s. That\u2019s where the fund comes from. Very rapidly we were working with independent productions around $10 or $20 million, which is relatively low now for big console video game projects. The fundamentals of evaluating these types of projects and putting in place risk containment methods are similar to venture capital. It almost always comes down to scrutinizing the team, the core idea, and being willing to hedge risk.", "I worked for three years with a company called Film Finances, which does performance and completion auditing on film projects. They\u2019re the biggest company doing that in the space. They take the foul-weather risk, and the film studios or video game publishers take the fair-weather risk, saying, \u201cWe\u2019ll buy the project at the end when it\u2019s finished.\u201d It\u2019s a fairly simple mechanism, very much in practice in the film industry, but very foreign to video games and interactive entertainment.", "Now I see, for the first time in my career, a true convergence coming in VR. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve committed my career to what I consider the best storytelling talent, doing primarily interactive storytelling, in the VR medium. My hope is I can help create a new type of financing mechanism for these companies.", "Freeman:", " I just got back from a trip to Asia, where this was especially interesting. People are talking about all these experience centers. It\u2019s exploding in China and Korea and others. Hundreds of experience centers opening up everywhere that are just dying for amazing content. They\u2019re all looking to us to find out how we get this content over to the U.S. from all these content creators in China and other Asian countries.", "There are tremendous rules and regulations around film. Gaming has its own limitations. VR is in a unique position right now where if we strategize correctly, we can capitalize on that and help U.S. content creators get access to money from abroad that will enable them to continue with not only capital, but also alternative forms of funding, so I\u2019d be curious to hear your thoughts on that pipeline to Asia.", "Jackson:", " Asia, and particularly China \u2014 we\u2019ve seen this for decades, where major companies like Sony have bought into the ecosystem of Hollywood and content creation for film. That\u2019s accelerating. I don\u2019t think we realize how fast it\u2019s going to happen. I would say that among the largest content-focused media companies in Hollywood, the shared understanding is now very international and very Asia-focused. You\u2019re seeing so many Chinese companies move into the equity capital area, using interesting slate financing and direction financing mechanisms that will enable Chinese companies to gain that access.", "We\u2019re going to see an acceleration in the coming years and that will impact VR, absolutely. The Chinese market may not adopt as quickly, but I\u2019m very excited. We\u2019re going to see a lot of new methods that benefit creators of content in this area.", "Freeman:", " Now we have Jon Goldman from Greycroft. I\u2019ve had the pleasure to get to know Jon pretty well over the past couple of months here, learning that he\u2019s an incredible entrepreneur as well as a venture partner. Foundation 9 was bootstrapped to more than a thousand people, which at the time was the largest independent gaming company \u2014", "Above: Job Simulator is a launch title on the HTC Vive.", "Jon Goldman:", " We were the largest independent developer of games, yeah.", "Freeman:", " With that knowledge, looking at all these pioneers in virtual reality gaming and content, what business models are you seeing that will stick, things that can actually generate revenue, things that you see as trends that these content creators could adopt when they\u2019re thinking about how to be successful? And for the business audience specifically, investors looking at content creators, not only what to look for, but also how they can bend some of their current investments toward something more stable.", "Goldman:", " Let me take a couple of those. In terms of shaping content, historically, if you\u2019re a content developer, there\u2019s a double-edged sword at the beginning of a platform. There\u2019s very little installed base, but if you do something really nice, you can get a high attach rate. You can get recognition in a way that\u2019s hard when there\u2019s a lot of users and a lot more content out there. It becomes more of a customer acquisition challenge.", "The typical models have been, as opposed to pure commercial art, where generally you go to people who do slate financing \u2014 versus a publishing play, where you\u2019re building infrastructure around your content that is about cross-promotion and customer acquisition. Increasingly we\u2019re seeing things in mobile game development that are going to apply to VR, which is becoming a social platform. That\u2019s things like live operations.", "When I was an active operator in the consumer games industry, it was a packaged goods business. You made something, put in a box, and in a couple weeks it would go to GameStop while you prayed and held your breath. Now you launch a game and that\u2019s just the beginning. Increasingly we\u2019ll see that with narrative in VR. That\u2019s the unanswered question. Compared to watching a TV show or a movie, how do you bring in a community? What social aspects do you bring to a narrative and how does that change the creation of the narrative?", "As to your next question, if you\u2019re investing in content, how do you look at that? For those of you who don\u2019t know Greycroft, we\u2019ve been very active in media and technology over the past 10 years. The Huffington Post was an early investment. Maker Studios is a recent one. We have a lot of expertise in online video. We\u2019ve started to be active in this space as well. We\u2019ve not announced anything yet, but we have been active in some companies that have been mentioned tonight.", "So what do I look for in something that\u2019s more of a content play? It\u2019s not just magic and wishful thinking. A few of the filters I go through \u2014 of course, like everyone said, team is the most important thing. But I start my filter from genre. There\u2019s lots of historic data around genre, whether it\u2019s film genres or game genres. What are the sales cycles there? Looking at those cycles, you can see the ups and downs.", "From genre, does a team have technology that supports a genre in an interesting way? That\u2019s where it becomes more of a venture bet, where you can see there\u2019s some kind of technical competence that undergirds that genre. Finally, is that team capable of doing something interesting with the technology in that genre? Do they have a history that ties them to this particular project? What are their contacts in this space? I\u2019m always a bit nervous when I see entrepreneurs, particularly in a new market like this, who are jumping in without a wide set of contacts related to what they\u2019re doing. As it turns out, in the early stages of a platform, the early adopters are other people in the industry.", "Above: This wouldn\u2019t look right at 90 frames per second.", "Freeman:", " One thing we\u2019ve recently is the Pokemon Go craze. Some people argue that\u2019s AR. Some people argue it\u2019s not. But regardless, it demonstrates one very important thing, which is the power of IP. It\u2019s incredible. They launched on the backbone of Niantic, which had built the technology, and overnight it was a global phenomenon.", "I\u2019m interested because I know about Walking Dead and some other interesting IP you guys have. What do you think about getting IP into the VR industry? What does that look like? What do entrepreneurs need to be thinking about? As we\u2019ve seen, it can really start to make waves.", "Goldman:", " What Taylor\u2019s referring to, I have a day job and a night job. I don\u2019t just invest. I\u2019m also involved in an entertainment company in Los Angeles called Skybound. We\u2019re the IP holders of Walking Dead. We\u2019ve had a lot of experience commercializing that world.", "A known IP is an amazing way to rise above the noise. But I would also say that in the early stages of a platform, this is the moment when you can create original IP. For something like Walking Dead, as far as I can tell from all the demos and pitches I\u2019ve seen, a lot of people seem to think that zombies are a good idea in VR. I see a lot of that.", "When you have a big brand, you can afford to hang around the hoop for a while until there\u2019s a large audience, a large installed base, and you can make lots of money. That\u2019s something that, as entrepreneurs \u2014 you can have a licensing strategy. You need to be smart about that in terms of timing. Right now, it\u2019s a fantastic time to be an original creator, an original voice. These early adopters picking up these platforms want fresh, original stuff. They\u2019re much more exploratory than the more mature users that will hopefully come in the next several years."]}

Of this amount, $500 million will go toward DCM\u2019s eighth flagship fund, $100 million to its second A-Fund for early-stage startups, and $170 million for its late-stage companies.", "\u201cThese new funds are a reflection of our ability to consistently deliver substantial distributions to our limited partners in all market environments,\u201d said David Chao, a cofounder and general partner at DCM. In an interview with VentureBeat, he explained that all three of these funds were oversubscribed and also that the company\u2019s new A-Fund will be focusing on industries such as mobile, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, messaging, and drones.", "Started 20 years ago, DCM specializes in early-stage investments in not only the U.S. but also China and Japan. Chao explained that these countries were the three largest information technology markets in the world. While DCM has ambitions to spread out into other countries \u2014 such as Israel, some parts of Europe, and Southeast Asia \u2014 the firm wishes to remain small, so expansion won\u2019t happen overnight. DCM currently spends most of its investment funds in China and the U.S., where it has had a large quantity of \u201chome runs.\u201d Less than 10 percent is put into Japanese startups.", "What\u2019s notable about this raise is that it seems DCM is interested in taking more risks, which is why its second A-Fund is oversubscribed \u2014 its predecessor had $60 million in its coffers. Chao said the firm was asked to limit money going into the fund to $100 million so as to not conflict with DCM\u2019s main fund. Started in 2011, these A-Funds are investments in companies that didn\u2019t ordinarily fit into the firm\u2019s profile or which come from a high-risk sector. DCM invests a small amount from these funds but expects a higher loss ratio since it\u2019s a riskier proposition. However, the rewards, should there be any, are huge for the venture capitalists.", "In the past, DCM has made investments in companies like Kakao Talk, Yik Yak, and Tencent. This second fund, which will allocate between $500,000 and $2 million per company, will look at key emerging industries. Chao believes that the second A-Fund will make more investments in China than in the U.S. He said that three years ago, China was a \u201cme too\u201d venture market, in that entrepreneurs there would mimic what happened in the U.S. Since that time, Chao said his team has seen incredible innovation, especially around mobile services like WeChat.", "Virtual reality is one innovative sector that DCM is exploring, as are\u00a0", "many other firms", ". Chao is optimistic that the technology has high potential in China because a \u201cmajority of the VR hardware is made in China. Just like laptops were taken over by Lenovo and Acer, China is going to have access to the cheapest VR.\u201d He said that China\u2019s gaming market is large and added that people in the country are used to visiting internet cafes where they\u2019re able to try out the technology. So far, DCM has made several seed investments there.", "Drones are another area that DCM wants to investigate further, especially for use in the commercial space. Previous investments in the space include automated drone system Kespry. It\u2019s likely that U.S. companies will be considered first, as there are clearer regulations around drones here than there are in China, where vague rules are a disincentive to investors.", "The last space of interest for DCM\u2019s second A-Fund is A.I. messaging, and the firm has already started making moves there with its ", "investment in X.ai", ". Narrowing the focus will help decide where investments are made. Chao explained that in the areas of machine learning, research, and academic work, the U.S. holds dominance, but China wins out when it comes to implementation and adoption \u2014 just look at the growth of WeChat. DCM is looking for cross-border deals with companies that leverage WeChat\u2019s high penetration while using U.S.-trained A.I. specialists.", "While DCM\u2019s A-Fund is certainly getting attention from limited partners and may continue to pick up steam, the firm also has its flagship fund, which Chao stated will continue to focus on business-to-business Software as a Service (SaaS) startups worldwide. The firm also has the aforementioned new platforms and those next-generation cross-border deals. Previous investments that DCM\u2019s flagship fund has made include customer relationship management provider Fxiaoke, along with Sansan and Freee.", "Chao said 20 percent of startups that received investment from DCM\u2019s first A-Fund will \u201cgraduate\u201d to the firm\u2019s main fund, which typically means between $5 million and $10 million, with a 15 to 25 percent ownership stake and a board seat.", "The companies that have received funding from DCM\u2019s previous flagship funds include 58.com, Kakao Talk, and SoFi.", "DCM\u2019s Turbo Fund has also received an infusion of capital. Dubbed the \u201cdouble down fund\u201d by Chao, it\u2019s aimed at select portfolio companies that the firm thinks have great potential to continue scaling.", "To date, more than $3 billion in assets are under DCM management.", "Updated at 7:50 a.m. Pacific on Thursday:", " Corrected to state DCM has been around for 20 years."]}

Focusing on attracting marketers in the telecom, banking, and software-as-a-service industries initially, Amplero claims that its clients have seen more than 3 percent incremental growth in revenue, and 5X retention benefits.", "So what will the funds be used for?", "\u201cWe intend to invest the proceeds of this raise in a concerted attack on the traction gap, with a specific focus on broadening and strengthening Amplero\u2019s team and revenue architecture, both sales and customer success, proving Amplero\u2019s application in key verticals, and\u00a0focusing on establishing the key dimensions of repeatability,\u201d Olly Downs, CEO at Amplero, told me. \u201cWe will be investing in product evolution towards increasing marketer accessibility and driving direct customer engagement. Our leading investment in machine learning innovation will continue, drawing\u00a0upon expanding our world-class internal team and our engagement with partners in academia.\u201d", "All of which means an increased focus on new industries, and new problems to solve. To get there, Amplero takes inspiration from complex issues being solved elsewhere.", "\u201cTo give some insight into what\u2019s next from a technical/science perspective, we can draw some parallels with some common themes and problems we see in society today,\u201d Downs said. \u201cFor example, our efforts to plan and predict multiple touches ahead in customer interactions (not just next best action, but next best series of interactions) is groundbreaking in the marketing technology arena. But this work is similar to the problems that some of the smartest scientists in the world\u00a0have had to solve in planning the trajectories of satellites for a missile defense system, where they need to think about a series of events and how they could play out collectively versus just planning for the next event.", "\u201cAnother example is our work in identifying\u00a0socially driven effects of influence on customer lifetime value (how does the behavior of those in my social graph influence my own retention or revenue behavior). Modeling and predicting this behavior starts to look a lot like the work that has been done by leading medical scientists when determining the real and potential threat of a given illness spreading across a population.\u201d", "Some of the forthcoming changes this raise helps to fund will be more functional in nature.", "\u201cIn addition to pushing forward on the technical and science front, look for Amplero to keep getting more and more (artificially) intelligent, but becoming increasingly simple for marketers to use and to determine actionable marketing, audience, and product insights,\u201d Downs said. \u201cWe\u2019re still a long way from regular marketers using basic personalization in email, apps, and the web, despite the demand for personalized experiences. How will we bridge that\u00a0gap, and what can we do to move beyond basic personalization to hyperpersonalized, 1:1 communications?\u201d", "Downs hopes that Amplero is the answer to that question, and ease-of-use will likely be the route to market if marketers are going to get on board with hyperpersonalized communications.", "\u201cWe see far too often really smart, creative marketing folks spending their days (and weeks/months) implementing and executing an A/B or multivariate test followed by weeks of analyzing the results to decide on a winner,\u201d Matt Fleckenstein, chief product officer at Amplero, told me.", "\u201cMarketers are brilliant at brainstorming new strategies to try and engage customers, grow the share of wallet they capture, or increase retention \u2014 and they are brilliant at coming up with creative assets that pay off the promise while playing to the human emotion,\u201d Fleckenstein said. \u201cComputers, on the other hand, are great at solving large, complex mathematical and optimization problems and doing so efficiently at scale. So, at Amplero, we feel one of the keys is to enable the marketer to do the strategy and creative, while empowering the machine to do what it does best.\u201d", "Of course, in an increasingly smartphone-driven world, we have to focus on the small screen when building out our marketing strategies. What is different about personalizing for mobile versus desktop?", "\u201cThere are definitely lots of similarities across these two media, but one of the most significant differences is the rich contextual data that often is available when personalizing for mobile,\u201d Fleckenstein said. \u201cThe obvious one is location, given that customers are increasingly connected 24/7 to brands through their mobile devices and there is rich data about that customer in terms of their geographic proximity to something noteworthy \u2014 to a brick and mortar store,\u00a0to a retail banking office, or even to another customer.", "\u201cBut what\u2019s also fascinating about engaging on mobile devices is the rich information that can be gleaned about others who are in their social spheres. We are increasingly leveraging social graph data\u00a0to help telecom companies predict and address customers most at risk of churning based upon the loyalty and/or defection patterns of others in their network.\u201d", "Amplero", "\u2018s series A funding was led by Wildcat Venture Partners with participation from Globys/Trilogy Equity Partners, Salesforce Ventures, and Seven Peaks Ventures."]}

That\u2019s not even close. Since 2009, Silicon Valley VCs have pumped $128 billion into more than 12,000 deals, with an average deal size of $11.5 million and a median of $3.5 million. That\u2019s a lot. NY\u2019s got a small fraction of that: $23.9 billion invested in around 4,000 deals, with an average deal size of about $7 million and a median of $2 million. The Valley crushes New York, not only in volume (expected), but also in deal size.", "In fact, even as other startup scenes (New York, Seattle, Boston) grow and mature, venture activity is actually becoming ", "more", " concentrated out West. According to ", "Professor Scott Shane", ", data from the NVCA from 2010-2015 shows that \u201cfrom 2010 to 2014, 38% of deals and 43% of dollars went to businesses in the Valley.\u201d That\u2019s compared to only 23% and 28% in the late 1980s. And over that time, the VC industry in the U.S. has exploded \u2013 from 1985 to 2014, the number of active VC firms grew from 294 to 803, according to the data Shane cites.

And this is where New York comes in; while it might be harder to raise capital in the northeast, there are two key, undeniable benefits that entrepreneurs should consider before turning down New York: sales, and exits.", "So you\u2019re a hot new social app that just raised a larger-than-expected Series A. It\u2019s time to start ramping up user acquisition and show that traction that you promised your Silicon Valley VCs. If this is your situation, then out West is the place for you. It\u2019s home to all of the best social networks and tech companies. You want corporate partnerships? You got \u2018em. Digital Marketers and Growth Hackers? They\u2019re there. Business Development? Easy. The Silicon Valley talent pool for tech is second to none. To put some data to the narrative: According to ", "Craig David", ", Silicon Valley employed more than 300,000 people in the tech sector in 2014. New York only employed 115,000. But the key statistic is, ", "what part of the total employment", " in the city is comprised of tech? In the Valley it\u2019s more than 25%, while in NY it\u2019s barely 3%. In other words, 97% of people who work in NY don\u2019t work in tech \u2013 but even though that makes it much, much harder to find talent, it\u2019s also a strategic benefit.", "The pitch for sales in NY is simple: If you\u2019re a startup trying to sell in the fashion, fintech, real estate, publishing, or retail spaces, New York is absolutely second to none. New York is the center of innovation for these industries; it\u2019s where the biggest fish swim. It\u2019s where you can network, meet, and talk to the executives you want. The value of being within a subway ride of JP Morgan\u2019s headquarters, for a fintech example, is invaluable. Take it from Fayez Mohamood, CEO of Bluecore, who was interviewed by The Observer about sales to big clients in NY: \u201cWhen it comes to getting to meet them, getting face time and understanding their pinpoints, this is the best place to be.\u201d Another CEO told the paper that NY is \u201cthe center of the universe for advertising, finance, and e-commerce. Everything we need is here.\u201d And in enterprise sales and partnerships, the value of actual in-person time cannot be understated. In a TechCrunch ", "interview", ", a New York startup CEO conveyed the argument succinctly: \u201cWe beat competitors every day because we\u2019re in the room while they\u2019re on WebEx.\u201d", "To summarize in one line: In NY, you\u2019ll have a much easier time selling to big name clients in powerful industries than you would in the Bay Area. And these kinds of partnerships and big sales leads are invaluable to companies. When you\u2019re showing traction to a VC, having a big name client that evokes the image of the bustling, powerful New York scene can often be the difference.", "Everyone knows that NY is the world\u2019s industry center. It\u2019s not hard to accept that it\u2019s a key advantage to be there if you want to secure big ticket clients and partnerships. But the second advantage of NY is much stealthier, and it has everything to do with the difference in VC ", "culture", " between NY and the Valley: exits. In short, NY companies on average exit at higher multiples than equivalent companies out West.", "First, some background. As part of a mentorship program for a ", "student organization", " I\u2019m part of, last year I met with an analyst at Insight Venture Partners (we\u2019ll call him Rob) for what would be my first talk with a venture/private equity professional (first of many, many talks). We got into Insight\u2019s investment philosophy, and he drew a stark contrast between how Silicon Valley VCs do things and how New York VCs do things. Out West, investment is all about vision, passion, and growth. It\u2019s about whether this will be the next company to change the world and to make your life fundamentally different. It\u2019s about the next Facebook, the next Google. Capital is spent much more loosely, and that\u2019s why the valuations are so much higher. The picture becomes clear when considering how things are done on the East Coast.", "New York Venture Capital, in Rob\u2019s vision, is practical, conservative, and realistic, words that aren\u2019t often attached to VC firms at all. In New York, we care about making money: how we\u2019ll exit the business, what the price is, and what the follow-on landscape will look like. We\u2019re much more down to earth than our colleagues out West. And this is something I\u2019ve already begun to see in my short time at the VC firm I\u2019m interning at. We\u2019ve turned down multiple deals that we thought would grow into nice-sized companies because we thought the price was too high, or there was no potential for a realistic exit. It\u2019s not that VCs out West don\u2019t operate this way \u2013 of course these things matter to them. But perhaps they\u2019re secondary.", "Rob was convinced that the New York way is the better way, moral questions about the purpose of investing aside. And the exit data backs him up: Pitchbook\u2019s ", "analysis", " shows that New York companies exit at higher multiples on average than their comrades in the Valley. Over the past 10 years, 77% of exits for venture-backed companies in New York took place at a 3x-10x multiple, while only 72% of the startups in the Bay Area did so. New York doesn\u2019t have the highest percentage of large multiple exits (that honor belongs to Chicago, at 81%), but it has a higher percentage than the Bay Area. And lest you think that a 5% difference isn\u2019t significant enough, recall that since 2009, Bay Area VC firms have invested roughly $128 billion in 12,000 deals. Let\u2019s assume that only \u2159 of those deals are for unique companies (i.e. not follow-ons); that puts the total new funding at around $21.3 billion for 2,000 startups, or about $10.7 million invested per startup. Conservatively putting all non-3x-10x exits at 2x, and all 3x-10x exits at 5x, a 5% jump in the number of 3x-10x exits for Silicon Valley companies would translate to an extra $3.2 billion in exit value over that period. If you move the average 3x-10x multiple to 7x, that almost doubles.", "So if you\u2019re an entrepreneur looking to start in New York, this is good. Chances are you\u2019ll be able to sell a successful business at a higher multiple than you could out West.", "So what do we have so far? Finding talent and VC money is much easier out West. Selling in key industries and exiting at bigger multiples is easier in New York. Where does that leave you, the entrepreneur?", "I think the answer is simple, but also profound. The different ", "natures", " of the New York and Bay Area locales should create different ", "types", " of startup ecosystems. Purely tech startups that need only developers and users, and that might be more capital intensive, should live out West.\u00a0Startups that are sales focused in the fintech, fashion, healthcare, or real estate verticals, where business may be less focused on ", "user", " acquisition and more on large partnerships and sales, should live out East. This is a vision for a specialized startup world \u2013 one where diversity, as always, is important, but one where the types of startups on both coasts differ greatly. Imagine a world where if you\u2019re a company of type x, then you ", "obviously", " choose to set up shop in city x, because that\u2019s where your best chance for success is.

There is still a $22 billion gap in mobile advertising in the U.S. alone, according to", " Mary Meeker\u2019s 2016 trend report", ", but mobile advertising is predicted to grow significantly over the next five years. This growth will generate more revenue, which can then be put back into the industry to fund developments that improve efficiency and effectiveness \u2014 transparency-enhancing tools chief among them. As transparency improves, brands will feel more comfortable investing in mobile, creating a virtuous cycle.", "Mobile publishers are clamoring for transparency in part because they are concerned with ad quality, which can be challenging to enforce\u00a0when you\u2019re working with a lot of different advertisers. Because brands\u2019 mobile spend is still limited, publishers and users are often subjected to low-quality, annoying mobile ads from less desirable advertisers.", "Transparency also means a more complete understanding of pricing, which cannot be achieved unless publishers know which ads are being served and how they are performing. Let\u2019s take a look at how mobile advertising is sold, and how these different methods affect transparency.", "Ad networks, such as Google\u2019s AdSense or the Facebook Audience Network, manage inventory from a wide variety of publishers and sell it to advertisers at a higher rate. This is an efficient way for publishers to access a large pool of already existing advertisers that buy on the Google and Facebook platforms and owned properties. It can also prove cost-effective for buyers\u00a0since they can negotiate deals that might not be possible through other, more open means. Despite these benefits, there is a glaring disadvantage: lack of transparency. These closed networks do not disclose how much advertisers are actually paying for ads, so it is difficult for publishers to understand their market value and to feel confident they are getting the best deal for their inventory.", "On the other hand, ad exchanges allow publishers to see exactly at what price impressions are being purchased. Exchanges aggregate a variety of supply and demand sources and allow almost anyone to buy and sell on their platform. This can make it harder to weed out fraud and low-quality traffic, but publishers value the transparent access to a greater volume of potential advertisers.", "Independently of which exchange they use, in order to get access to more demand and better pricing/visibility, publishers started using technologies such as header bidding, a rapidly growing approach to digital advertising that allows publishers to access multiple exchanges and, in turn, an even greater number of potential advertisers.", "For publishers, transparency also means having the freedom to set up direct deals and private marketplaces with advertisers. Private marketplaces are closed auctions in which publishers can sell premium inventory to an advertiser, or group of advertisers. Unlike open exchanges, they are by invitation only, and they are usually transparent in terms of pricing, ad quality, and audience. Recent research from MoPub, released in its", " Global Mobile Programmatic Trends Report", ", shows that more transactions are taking place on private marketplaces. According to their findings, in Q4 2015 there were 30 percent more private marketplace deals, which saw 165 percent more spend than Q3 2015.", "Other industry developments that demonstrate the market is ready for, and already moving toward, enhanced transparency include AppNexus\u2019 recent launch of an open video marketplace\u00a0and Google\u2019s approach to ad traffic quality control that allows publishers to view what ads are being served and to raise a red flag when they\u2019re concerned. SSPs and ad servers are also creating more internal mechanisms to improve transparency, as well as partnering with third-party solutions such as GeoEdge that\u00a0provide ad verification and visibility tools for publishers, exchanges, and networks.", "Brands\u2019 big marketing budgets will contribute significantly to the further improvement of the mobile advertising ecosystem. The $22 billion gap in mobile spending is indeed colossal, but it is actually a $3 billion improvement from ", "the $25 billion gap of 2015", ". Mobile spend is increasing. In fact, it is poised to overtake desktop advertising for the first time. ", "According to recent research from eMarketer", ", advertisers are predicted to spend $22.58 billion in the U.S. on display-based formats; of this, 77.5 percent will be used to reach people on their mobile devices. Brands\u2019 increased spend is both a cause and a consequence of increased transparency. The more transparency improves, the more confident they will feel spending their advertising dollars, as they will have a better understanding of how their campaigns are performing and feel confident in the overall advertising experience, including the quality of publisher site, the ad, and the audience.", "A larger, more mature industry has concomitantly more mature technology needs. In 2016, we have seen, and will continue to see, significant strides on the transparency front. The industry is ready to prioritize transparency, but there is no reason to think we\u2019re off schedule.

We\u2019ve seen a few things that are awesome to do in VR, and one of them is this instant creation, sculpting and things like that. There\u2019s a number of demos, but Tilt Brush is probably the prettiest. Done in Unity, by the way. Not that it matters. It\u2019s just a wonderful product regardless. But that\u2019s one of the immediate attractions of VR. Video consumption, visiting spaces you couldn\u2019t otherwise visit\u2014besides games these are some of the big use cases.", "We\u2019re experimenting with things like this, but in the end, something like Tilt Brush turns out not to be, at least in its current incarnation, that useful for making games. It\u2019s not a criticism of Tilt Brush. It\u2019s just a specific purpose.", "GamesBeat: I\u2019d have to go learn some code still to start making games, or my kids would?", "Helgason:", " You don\u2019t have to learn to code. There are node-based systems in Unity, like Playmaker and so on. That\u2019s not a necessary thing. It\u2019s more that you have to be thinking in code, thinking in a logical, structured way. It\u2019s a skill set you have to learn.", "We wish that the objects, like characters, in games were a little bit smarter, so they could find their own way. Then you could \u2014 there\u2019s a French word that gets used sometimes, \u201cbricolage,\u201d where you just tinker and put together games like that. That\u2019s the path, I think, whether you\u2019re writing codes or connecting nodes.", "GamesBeat: Media Molecule has Dreams, which might be a VR title. You\u2019re doing something similar, creating worlds inside a game.", "Helgason:", " And Microsoft has Project Spark. That\u2019s pretty cool. There have been a few attempts at this. Minecraft, of course. They don\u2019t quite end up as actual game-making tools. There\u2019s always been some kind of \u2014 I sometimes call it the Bermuda Triangle, between tinkering and actual game development. I\u2019m not sure why it\u2019s like that, but nobody\u2019s found a way to cross it. We\u2019ve explored ways to get over the gap, but I don\u2019t know anyone who\u2019s found an ideal way to do that. I wish we could, because it seems like the logical end point for Unity.", "GamesBeat: You\u2019ve played around with monetization and discovery services within Unity. I suppose that speaks to the reality that enabling people to make a game isn\u2019t enough anymore.", "Helgason:", " It turns out that you need quite a team to build a game, just like in the old days. Back then you needed to build all the components of an engine. Now you need to build the monetization and live ops team. Piece by piece we\u2019re getting to a point where we alleviate that pressure and make it easier to monetize, to get some viral traffic and so on.", "We\u2019re far from finished, though. It\u2019s a lot of work. Every time we solve a problem or remove the need for something, another need pops up. It\u2019s the nature of a competitive market. But we\u2019ll never give up on that.", "Above: Some of the Unity-based VR projects in the works.", "GamesBeat: I wonder what you think about the health of the industry in general. Enabling millions of people to make games was this tremendous step forward, but then it led to all these fears of an indie bubble. Now there are too many people making games. They\u2019re not all getting attention or making money and they\u2019ll go out of business in droves. That\u2019s one extreme. What do you think is coming?", "Helgason:", " We\u2019re between things. A couple of years back it felt like a golden age. Everything seemed to be working. There was no end of opportunity. Now it\u2019s more competitive. But if you go four or five more years back it\u2019s the same. There\u2019s a seesaw pattern to this. New opportunities come in. You have the rise of thousands of studios. Then there\u2019s consolidation and they compete each other out of business for a few years.", "The good thing about this industry is that every two or three years, there\u2019s a new cycle of something. We\u2019re maybe a bit behind or between right now. Mobile is getting tough, although there continues to be interesting opportunities for really creative people. PC is fine, but competitive. VR is still a bit further out than we\u2019d like, at least for real monetization. There\u2019s a lot of money-chasing, project financing, investors and so on, but the market isn\u2019t there.", "It\u2019s funny. If you plot the perceived health of the industry year by year, I\u2019m not sure where we\u2019d be. Maybe we\u2019re at six out of 10? Whereas a couple of years ago it felt more like an eight or a nine. I don\u2019t know how many people might agree. Are we at six? Four? Six point five? It depends where you\u2019re standing. What do you think?", "GamesBeat: I\u2019m amazed by how flat the world is when it comes to game development.", "Helgason:", " It\u2019s astonishing. At least in development. Distribution is a bit more uneven.", "GamesBeat: I wrote a story last year about these Siberians who made a game that got 30 million downloads. Now they\u2019ve built a company of 100, still in Siberia. It could be that cold places are good for game development, I guess. But you\u2019d never have predicted that during the PC and console era.", "That\u2019s the good part. Then you have this other force in the industry that\u2019s consolidated everything around Supercell, Machine Zone, and King. How much money is left over for everyone else?", "Helgason:", " There are some powerful forces there. But if you look at it, yes, these guys are very dominant. They\u2019re pouring so much of their revenue back into ads, though, and a lot of that finds its way to the smaller studios. Where else does it go? These are the people who generate traffic without necessarily being really good at monetization.", "GamesBeat: I never thought of that as a benefit for the game industry.", "Helgason:", " Of course, it might be better if it wasn\u2019t like that, but there\u2019s a certain auto-correcting effect there. We see very small studios, two to four people, building incredible returns on their investment in that way. There are some strange mechanisms at work. But the gravity at the top of the list is a bit scary.", "GamesBeat: It\u2019s amazing that Supercell has $2.3 billion in revenue last year on the back of 180 employees and only four games. You compare the efficiency of that to making Call of Duty every year, and I think they have Call of Duty beat, right?", "Helgason:", " I haven\u2019t checked the numbers, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019re right. Then you have two or three people in Australia making Crossy Road. It\u2019s pretty insane. They might actually have a higher ROI, even if it\u2019s a much smaller overall number.", "GamesBeat: Don Daglow was on stage here this morning. He was talking about the art of video games and storytelling and emotion. I asked him, \u201cHow much of that have you seen in mobile gaming or VR?\u201d He\u2019s pretty much saying, \u201cNot yet.\u201d I wonder if that\u2019s important or not.", "Helgason:", " I guess whether art is important is a bit of a personal question. For me it is. I\u2019ve seen some pretty beautiful things on mobile. I\u2019m proud of having been the engine for some of these things. There are also some things that are not exactly art, but they\u2019re so wonderful they become these weird cultural artifacts, like Kerbal Space Program or Surgeon Simulator. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re art, but I like the world better with those things in it.", "GamesBeat: In your new position, you can think about your interests beyond Unity.", "Helgason:", " I spend a lot of time with Unity, but that\u2019s true. It\u2019s not as much as when I was CEO.", "Above: The Night Cafe demo by Borrowed Light Studios lets you walk around a Van Gogh painting.", "GamesBeat: What are some of those interests now?", "Helgason:", " My kids do take some time. [laughs] I spend a lot of time at conferences talking to customers and partners and friends in the industry. Besides that, I\u2019m passionate about technology in general. I like developer technology. Even outside the game industry, there are some clever people building products and they\u2019re cool to hang out with.", "For my own education, so I don\u2019t stagnate totally \u2014 it\u2019s always a risk when you\u2019ve been in business too long \u2014 I\u2019ve been looking at biotech companies. The companies that attract me the most there are kind of platform companies, people who generate tools for other biotech companies. I think it somehow reminds me of Unity. Companies that make DNA printing easier, or make protein production faster and more efficient.", "People go blind and deaf or lose limbs, and the idea is that maybe you can connect directly to their brains. That\u2019s fairly established now. It\u2019s working better and better every year. The problem is these things aren\u2019t really stable. The nerve tissue breaks down. It\u2019s a mess. It\u2019s better than being blind and deaf or missing a limb, but it\u2019s not something that healthy people would try. It\u2019s too unstable and crazy.", "But there\u2019s work into non-invasive or partially non-invasive things where we might be able to connect your brains to computers. It\u2019s a place where software and games and VR and biotech will meet. There are some crazy things going on in that space. I don\u2019t know too much about it, but I\u2019m exploring. Maybe to prepare against the Infocalypse or whatever they call it.", "GamesBeat: The talk on VR just before ours was getting into this idea of modifying our brains to better perceive virtual reality. It was interesting.", "Helgason:", " There will be some amazing things happening every year from now until we die. It\u2019s just a question of \u2014 is it five, 10, or 15 years before we\u2019re pretty well connected to computers?", "Question: What can VR do in the future?", "Helgason: What\u2019s more important to me is what VR can do, where instead of having to go places we can stay where we are. It doesn\u2019t matter so much how fast the fan runs or how hot the chip is. If it takes the place going into the stratosphere and flying for 10 hours, the amount of energy we save is so vast.", "My friend Hilmar Veigar, the CEO of CCP, is probably one of the biggest visionaries in VR. He makes very forceful arguments that the only way to save the world is through VR. When I listen to him, at least, I believe what he says. I\u2019m not so sure afterwards. I can\u2019t repeat the argument completely. But his point, for instance, is that if we all go to Mount Everest we\u2019ll destroy Mount Everest. If people build that into an experience, though, we can all go there. If you extrapolate a bit, that\u2019s the important part."]}

Most smart sensors will last for three years on the two AA batteries.", "Among many other applications, these sensors can be used for monitoring the air pressure in clean rooms or hospital operating rooms, where the pressure has to be high to prevent germs from being sucked into the room.", "Chandhok said the sensors are designed to be efficient as well as smart. They won\u2019t, for instance, send every piece of data every 15 minutes to a data center over a wireless connection.

Filmed in Los Angeles, the commercial highlights issues many of us have when owning and driving a car, such as dealing with parking tickets, being cited for driving under the influence, getting into accidents, putting up with endless traffic jams, and more.

So it could take a minute, 10 minutes, an hour, or a day.\u00a0Stone said that the more people on the app, the better the experience will be \u2014 of course.", "The difference between version 1.0 of Jelly and this current form isn\u2019t substantial. Yes, the company has done away with the social network integration and put less emphasis on camera use, but for the most part, the core Jelly experience is the same. If it didn\u2019t work then, will it work now? Stone\u2019s team may think that the updated workflow and user experience can be the thing that helps Jelly be a hit app, but it\u2019s a stretch. Right now, the Jelly app seems to be a\u00a0bit light on the bells and whistles, and what\u00a0could\u00a0ultimately make it\u00a0worthwhile to the greater masses.", "Over the course of Jelly\u2019s various transformations, the company has received some funding. At first, Stone self-funded it to prove that it was a legitimate service. Then he called up Spark Capital before taking more money from Greylock Partners, two firms that Stone knew from his time at Twitter. The exact amount hasn\u2019t been disclosed, but\u00a0Stone said he took a \u201cmodest amount\u201d from outside partners.

Right around that time we were already starting to engage with our first client, CDM Smith. We announced today that we have this partnership developing HoloLens solutions for them.", "VB: Who are they?", "Hoffman:", " CDM Smith is one of leading consulting firms in architecture, engineering, and construction. A lot of people in the industry know it as AEC. It\u2019s the epicenter of where 3D matters, because it\u2019s all about 3D design. It\u2019s designing big infrastructure projects. CDM Smith designs wastewater treatment plants, dams, traffic interchanges. They do a lot of oil and gas, other energy sector consulting.", "We\u2019re focused on helping them solve some of their collaboration challenges.

Then the construction crew starts building it.", "Above: Object Theory\u2019s work for CDM Smith shows collaboration with HoloLens.", "The collaboration between the engineers and the construction crew can often be a challenge. It\u2019s very error-prone. You do things by phone, whatever it takes to solve the problem. The engineers are rarely on site. They\u2019re almost always at one of CDM Smith\u2019s offices, which are geographically dispersed. You have a dispersed team all trying to solve problems. Their main mission is reducing costs, reducing errors, making better decisions.", "We\u2019re at the epicenter of trying to help them figure that out. We\u2019re focused on what it means to take design models and bring them into HoloLens and have multiple people all across the globe engage in a conversation around that model to solve a real problem. Recently they\u2019d ordered a piece of equipment, and what was delivered was bigger than they expected. It didn\u2019t fit in the allotted space.", "They had to make a decision. Do you reroute pipes? Do you rip out the old platform that houses it? Do you move a wall? They make those kinds of decisions all the time \u2014 last-minute accommodations. It requires those engineers to be part of the conversation. One big thing we\u2019re showcasing here is the ability to use remote collaboration in HoloLens with avatars that let you have shared conversations around a single point of interest.", "We\u2019ve had a lot of interesting realizations. With HoloLens you know where someone is looking. Not necessarily where the eyes are looking, but where the head\u2019s pointing. You have this precise hands-free way of pointing at things. It\u2019s great for remote because we may not be able to communicate where your eyes are looking across a phone call, but we can pass across where in a three-dimensional model, where exactly you\u2019re looking at. We take advantage of that.", "We started loading these complex models into HoloLens. One of them was a 60-acre construction site. It started off as billions of data points from a laser scan. Those billions of points were reduced to a mesh of that 60 acres and we would just show the 60-acre mesh with fully detailed texture of what it looks like. One of the guys on that site at the time to take the scan, he saw his own safety vest in the back of his pickup in the model. That gives you an idea of the detail.", "We\u2019d have conversations where he\u2019d look at that thing in the pickup and I\u2019d know he was looking at the pickup. He could show me the safety vest. Within a second we\u2019re both sharing a conversation with high accuracy and fidelity. It was an eye-opener. HoloLens is amazing for collaborating around anything that\u2019s fundamentally a three-dimensional problem. That industry has lots of three-dimensional problems.", "Above: Object Theory shows how you can collaborate on a building design in HoloLens.", "VB: This could go to different levels. There are more things you could do, it seems like. If the construction engineer on site had one of these on his head, he could be looking in a certain direction and you could overlay what\u2019s supposed to be there. It gives you the right position, where it\u2019s supposed to fit.", "Hoffman:", " Absolutely. There\u2019s always a challenge between \u201cas designed\u201d and \u201cas constructed.\u201d It\u2019s a dance between the original design intent and the actual construction. To be able to put the original design models on top of the construction and see the deltas, the things that are right or wrong \u2014 that\u2019s very powerful. You can immediately say, \u201cWait a minute, that pipe will be in the way of this other pipe.\u201d It\u2019s a powerful way to make quick assessments that are much more efficient and accurate than has ever been possible before.", "VB: Is there also a difference between doing this in AR versus doing it in VR?", "Hoffman:", " VR is good for some phases of this, but not many. One thing about VR, and I\u2019m sure you already know this, is that with VR you\u2019re not able to do anything without worrying about falling or running into something. You\u2019re stuck with a completely immersive experience. Very few of those are good at helping you navigate your environment in a meaningful way.", "For the initial understanding of a space in a model where you don\u2019t necessarily need to navigate it effectively \u2014 The difference with navigation in VR is that you don\u2019t get a sense of space quite as intuitively as if you\u2019re literally in the space walking around. That has its limits, because the space you can walk around has to be big enough that you can get around your model, which is a challenge if you\u2019re building something as big as a water treatment plant. We would end up having some of the same challenges.", "But in AR, there are two big differences. One, we can overlay in the real world. The other is that you can have a conversation with a person. I can look at a model in a fishbowl, so to speak, the war room scenario planning type of thing. I can look at you and have a conversation. We can both point at a nonexistent object in front of it. Everything is aligned accurately enough that we\u2019ll be seeing the same thing to such fidelity that we\u2019ll point at the same thing. That lets you have these conversations around something that doesn\u2019t physically exist.", "You can\u2019t do that in VR. You and I could not both have Oculus headsets on and have a conversation about a shared model. It\u2019ll get there. To be honest, eventually all of this will converge. But right now AR, or what Microsoft more often refers to as mixed reality, to differentiate from all these other versions of the concept \u2014 with mixed reality, collaboration is one of the biggest opportunity spaces for HoloLens.", "VR is a subset of AR. Anything you can do in VR, you can do with an AR headset. But you can\u2019t do everything an AR headset can do with a VR headset. HoloLens is actually a completely applicable VR device. We use VR all the time in our scenarios for walking through an environment.", "Above: Microsoft HoloLens", "VB: Where does this go from here? Does your client productize it for architects and construction people?", "Hoffman:", " CDM Smith does everything from original conception of a project all the way through construction. They\u2019re starting to get into operating the facilities they build as well. They see opportunities. We\u2019ve helped them identify opportunities across the gamut of what they do. But we\u2019ve decided with them that the one area of focus is this emerging field called virtual design construction.", "VDC is an industry term that\u2019s coming to mean, \u201cDon\u2019t have such a big handoff between design and construction. Have it be more seamless and collaborative than it\u2019s been before.\u201d But there are missing pieces for making it seamless and collaborative. Together we\u2019re focused on how to solve some of the challenges in making it seamless, that handoff between design and construction.", "That\u2019s the initial focus, but we\u2019ve identified other areas that are also valuable. In the future, there\u2019s going to be a lot of IoT (Internet of Things) in these facilities. There\u2019s already some, but IoT is going to completely take over things like water treatment plants, power plants, you name it. Even highways will eventually have IoT components embedded along the way for things like detecting damage and planning maintenance.", "All that telemetry feeds heuristics that can then feed back into the experience of identifying problems and training people. If you need to fix a particular valve, you can lead that person to the valve, give them the complete history of the valve, and then provide a three-dimensional walk-through of how to fix it.

Is it available for dev kit users to start looking at?", "Hoffman:", " We\u2019re focused almost entirely on custom engagements. We\u2019re building a huge arsenal of foundational components \u2014 for avatars, for annotating things in 3D space with voice and photos and text. That tool chest we\u2019re only making available right now to our clients.", "During the initial phases of engaging with us they don\u2019t need dev devices, because we have devices. That\u2019s not a requirement. They\u2019ll obviously want to acquire their own eventually, but during the phase where we\u2019re designing the software solution for them, they don\u2019t need to have engineers or devices necessarily. We\u2019re more than happy to augment a customer\u2019s team if they want to build expertise internally, but our primary focus is to be their HoloLens solution architect.", "We\u2019re in a position to take on clients. We\u2019re building some real solutions. That said, we want to be good community citizens. We plan on open-sourcing some parts of what we have so everyone can benefit. We believe the pie will be big enough that we can afford to contribute to the larger community and still be a viable company.", "VB: What are some other scenarios you\u2019re designing for across the board?", "Hoffman:", " Some of the categories we see repeating patterns in \u2014 in medicine there are two very clear areas that keep coming up. One is in the operating theater. A surgeon wants to be able to see all the scans and relevant data on the patient without having to constantly look up at monitors. Instead, while you\u2019re operating, around you all the information is readily accessible and it\u2019s in 3D. The human body is a 3D challenge. You can see the scans in 3D, rotate the scans in 3D, and have a lot more information. The amount of additional intuiting you can do is ridiculous. The other medical scenario is training. It\u2019s very much like the Case Western scenario that was showcased at the keynote.", "I can\u2019t wait until everybody experiences a three-dimensional problem in 3D, so they can see how much easier it is to understand. It has applications for everyone from surgeons to baristas to car mechanics. Anybody who has work to do, who has information they have to look at.", "Above: Avatars for Microsoft HoloLens project.", "Another scenario is retail space planning. Retail spaces change all the time and someone has to decide what works. You can use it for user research. You can use it for just the initial design. It\u2019s hard, in a physical space, to know if a layout is too constraining to walk through. In retail spaces you think about things like that. What first grabs your attention walking into a space? They can use HoloLens to experience all of that before they ever build a mockup or an actual store. They sometimes do life-size mockups before they ever build a store. We allow them to do that experimentation much more efficiently.", "There\u2019s premium assisted selling, like the Volvo scenario. You want to design a custom Nike shoe at a flagship Nike store. You can just design it in 3D. Again, it\u2019s fundamentally a 3D problem. You can imagine, in the car scenario, seeing different treatments of all the choices you\u2019ve made. How does the interior of the car look with wood paneling versus carbon fiber versus leather? You can try all those options without having every model of the car available in the showroom.", "Related to that is assisted manufacturing. One of the biggest movements in industry is \u201ceverything is different.\u201d Every car is different. Every plane is different. We\u2019re moving to a world where you make one of each thing. You don\u2019t make 100 or 1,000 or 1,000,000. Anywhere you make very few of the exact same thing, it\u2019s hard to keep your manufacturing personnel trained.", "One of the big opportunity spaces is using HoloLens to walk through all the right steps in the manufacturing process so you don\u2019t make mistakes. That way you can use less skilled labor to accomplish the same outcome. There\u2019s an efficiency play. Boeing did a substantial research project to prove that augmented reality increases efficiency and reduces errors in manufacturing. I\u2019ve been trying to post everything relevant that I can find on my LinkedIn, and that\u2019s one I uncovered recently.", "VB: Do you do any work in games as well, or are you leaving that to others?", "Hoffman:", " As Object Theory, we\u2019re staying away from games. The closest we\u2019ll come to games is the larger entertainment industry. A couple of sweet spots we\u2019re seeing \u2014 I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve heard of The Void, but it\u2019s this concept of merging virtual reality with the physical world and have a sort of hybrid experience. The theme parks are thinking about this. How can a theme park create an interesting AR experience? Maybe it\u2019s some combination of animatronics in the physical world, plus virtual reality.", "We\u2019re starting to see some interest in those entertainment scenarios. The other possibility is premium VIP experiences for, say, a showcase movie. You\u2019d have the premium version of a movie that HoloLens augments in some way. Or a concert\u2019s playing, but you can experience that concert in 3D as if you\u2019re there, even if you can\u2019t be there.", "We\u2019re seeing lots of those kinds of things. They\u2019re not as interesting to us as the founders of this company. We\u2019re more interested in solving the hardcore industrial challenges. But there are some interesting projects that we would probably do if they ended up in our lap. We\u2019d be excited about that.", "Above: HoloLens demo from Case Western University.", "VB: Is what you\u2019re doing easier as a startup than it would be inside Microsoft?", "Hoffman:", " Not necessarily. I love startups. I\u2019m a startup guy. But the HoloLens team at Microsoft rocks. It\u2019s the most amazing place I\u2019ve ever worked, and I\u2019ve been a lot of places. I\u2019ve been an early player in a lot of companies. It\u2019s the most high-functioning team I\u2019ve worked on. It feels like an extended family. Everywhere I go I\u2019m hugging all these people I worked with at Microsoft because they\u2019re all awesome. They\u2019re all human. They\u2019re all team players. We all constantly looked out for each other and helped each other. It was magical.", "It was really hard to leave that job. I was so happy. But the commute was killing me. It was unfortunate that it didn\u2019t work out. That said, I\u2019m a startup guy. I think this is the future. I\u2019m the kind of guy that\u2019s willing to take a big bet. I absolutely believe that as a startup we\u2019ll be helping invent the future.", "VB: How many people do you have?", "Hoffman:", " We\u2019re only five full-time permanent right now, but we use a lot of outside contractors for art and sound and video and storyboarding.

We\u2019re pretty sure that after this Build, now that we\u2019re out in the open about having devices and being a Microsoft partner, the floodgates are going to open. We want to be ready for that.", "We want to have at least two to three studios that can handle two to three simultaneous projects. There\u2019s some efficiency in scale because you can have specialists. One of the hardest hires is a technical artist. They\u2019re hard to find and they\u2019re relatively expensive. The expense isn\u2019t the issue as much as they\u2019re just hard to find. You don\u2019t need a technical artist per studio, though. You need one for two or three studios. To have one on staff you actually need more than one studio.", "We\u2019re looking at ramping up to two to three studios, maybe three to four, that can each take on projects and work relatively autonomously, but share specialty capabilities. A sound engineer is the other big one. You can\u2019t afford a sound engineer if you just have a single studio.", "VB: Have you already raised money, or do you need to raise money?", "Hoffman:", " Right now Raven and I are funding the company through putting money in and working for free. I\u2019m a platform guy. My entire career I\u2019ve built platform solutions for business. We\u2019re both always looking for that platform play. If we think there\u2019s a certain opportunity to bring the world\u2019s best collaboration solution for HoloLens to market as a product, we would do that. That\u2019s when we\u2019d be looking for venture capital.", "Right now we\u2019re not that attractive because we\u2019re mainly a cost plus service business. We\u2019re like a digital agency in how we operate. We don\u2019t actually need venture capital. But that could change very fast.

So, Mike [Ghaffary, Eat24\u2019s CEO] talked about knowing that customers of his company are 10x more valuable than they are on the Web. How do they know that?

[hands raise] How many times did that piss you off? Okay, well I\u2019m the asshole that makes Pinterest do that. The reason I can do that is because I know the answer to our mobile equation.", "What the mobile equation asks is simply: What\u2019s going to make me more money, or make my company have more engaged users? Pushing someone to use the mobile Web experience I created, or to go further and try to get them to download that app?", "And, there\u2019s a really easy way to do that: You just do an A-B test. Some people come to your mobile website, you tell them to download the mobile app, and you don\u2019t allow the mobile Web. And for some people, you just go through the mobile Web experience. And you cohort those users, you can basically see where you get more engaged users and more revenue over time.\u00a0So we did that experiment at Pinterest.

But there\u2019s a lot of complicating factors here. It depends on how good your current mobile Web experience is. It depends on how good your current mobile app is. It also depends on how good your sign up flow on your mobile app is. And lastly, it depends on how good your actual app interstitial is. We did this mobile equation and said: \u201cOkay, well we activated at 3x the rate, but what that actually means when you get that decreased conversion is that a mobile app user is worth 1.2, versus a mobile Web user who is worth 1. So, once we learned this, we said \u201chow can we make that equation bigger for us?\u201d", "So we took every step of that funnel and we just tried to improve it. So we did probably 15 iterations on a mobile app interstitial, increasing the conversion rate to the mobile app every time, almost. We also took a look at how could we optimize our mobile sign up flow. If people are landing from something specific on mobile Web \u2014 like they\u2019re coming from SEO \u2014 can we show them that level of specificity as soon as we show them the app instead of going through a generic sign up form? All of these things increased mobile app conversion, which increased our mobile equation, tilting toward the mobile app.", "If some of you are dependent on Google as a source of traffic, you\u2019ll probably be aware that they\u2019ve announced that if you have a mobile app interstitial, you\u2019ll no longer be considered \u201cmobile-friendly.\u201d And what that means is long-term they will probably rank you lower on mobile. So, what we were able to find is that we could just make our interstitial a header which you could scroll right past, and see the content, and that fits within Google\u2019s guidelines. It\u2019s maybe skirting around it, but it fits within their guidelines today\u2026 The next thing we did is maybe going a little bit further is, if you click on anything on the mobile website, we will actually take you to Google Play or the App Store to get that download. And, that also gives us more information about what you care about when you open that mobile app for the first time.", "\u2026When you look at the process of downloading an app, it takes time. People go and do other things. So what we did, once we took you to the App Store or Google Play, is we reloaded your browser with a reminder that you went to go download the app. So it says, \u201cThank you for checking out the Pinterest app, click here to sign in.\u201d That also increased the benefits of the mobile app for us.", "Another thing that you need to think about, if you\u2019re looking at your mobile equation, is it might be different in different landing pages. It might be different in different countries. We find that in Germany, the mobile equation is totally different\u2026", "You can answer the question right now if it\u2019s better to optimize for a mobile app experience or a mobile Web experience. You don\u2019t have to take it as strategic \u2014 you don\u2019t have to take it on faith that this is where the company is going.

This platform will allow you to build applications to get even closer to that ultimate goal of putting everybody in the same place at once.", "VB: One of the more interesting strands about your platform is that real-time translation. When you play the game, you see a chat coming through, and because it\u2019s in English, you assume it\u2019s an English speaker, but really it could be from anywhere in the world. Can you talk about how that works?", "Leydon:", " That was a feature we had to do. It wasn\u2019t something we set out to do. But as soon as you try to put everyone from around the world in a social situation\u2014we didn\u2019t want a Polish player to feel out of place if there are only Americans around him.

It\u2019s not exactly like high-frequency trading, but they\u2019re cousins of a kind. When you apply it to games, you can see people fighting and chatting and doing all these other things. When you deal with marketing, you have hundreds of channels of impressions and clicks and fraud and installs and these other things coming in.", "What happens very quickly is you\u2019re deploying more and more money, and you need to be able to put the brakes or the gas on at any moment. Things can go wild. But once we build that software set we can use it in our games. It\u2019s the proper way to run a service, in my opinion. We can do a lot of things a lot better. But to run a service\u2014if we have latency in Game of War iterations that\u2019s obviously a problem. We need to move as fast as possible. That means our tech stack needs to move as fast as possible.", "The platform appeared out of needing that for our own applications. We needed something where we could build marketing applications and operations applications and gaming applications. We needed an easy way to interface with that technology.", "VB: Can you access this technology for the marketing components, or is it just the community layer?", "Leydon:", " You\u2019re not getting an app. You\u2019re getting a networking layer.

You had these huge wells of traffic that came online all of a sudden in 2012 and 2013 \u2013 Facebook, YouTube, Google started doing more. Everybody started doing more right around that time. There was this moment where it was all beta. Nobody was using this stuff. It was very new. There weren\u2019t even app installs at the time. We had a product that people liked, though, and it was something we could market.

It\u2019s a tremendous amount of work. And it\u2019s a lot of work for no good reason, sometimes. Sometimes it\u2019s because of fraud. Sometimes people are shaving money. Sometimes people are playing games. It\u2019s a lot of work.", "In the beginning you go to Facebook, because it\u2019s clean. They have a lot of data, a lot of engineering support. But as you grow, Facebook will only grow with you so much. They have two million advertisers. So then you go to YouTube or Google, the next guys. Then you run out of room to grow there. Now you\u2019re going to the 298 other guys, and you\u2019re getting down into affiliates and so forth. It becomes really nasty.", "That\u2019s okay, because everything has its value. You can buy any kind of traffic, as long as you\u2019re paying the right price for it. Except for fraud. Can\u2019t pay for fraud. But the anger of dealing with this is so immense\u2014I thought I was going to just leave the stage and that was it. I got hundreds of emails. I still get probably 50 a day, even from people who work at the kinds of places I talked about.

Who wants to go on stage and say, \u201cAll my partners suck\u201d? They don\u2019t want to say that because they have to go back and deal with them.

They\u2019re not stable. They\u2019re very unstable. They don\u2019t know how unstable they are. It\u2019s kind of reflected in their valuations and their multiples. The market understands.", "One thing that was glossed over in that interview was the concept of a 1X multiple. That\u2019s just ravaging the advertising industry. If you have a 1X multiple on your business, you are a straight up sales organization. You can\u2019t help it. It\u2019s the only thing you can\u2019t help. You\u2019re not an infrastructure company. You can\u2019t be an infrastructure company. Which takes away the incentive to do any infrastructure.", "One of the fun things I thought about afterward was how to look at what your experience will be like working with an ad network. I have a quick and dirty ratio for you to think about. What is their sales to engineering ratio? Ask the network. \u201cHow many salesmen do you have and how many engineers do you have?\u201d Facebook has about 20 salespeople and a thousand engineers. A lot of these smaller networks have the split going the other way \u2013 20 salespeople and five engineers.", "That blend of employees is going to affect your experience when you work with them. They won\u2019t make new features. They\u2019ll try to push monetization harder and harder. It\u2019s something we all deal with. It\u2019s a shortcut for a buyer when they approach a new partner.", "VB: What drives them to do that? What is about the multiple? WPP is one of the largest agencies out there. Why can\u2019t it invest in \u2014", "Leydon:", " Yeah, they have 30,000 employees collectively. WPP, I can\u2019t speak for them, but agencies in general\u2014engineers don\u2019t work for agencies. They\u2019re competing with Facebook and Google and Machine Zone where we\u2019re doing really cool stuff. They don\u2019t go to work for ad agencies. It\u2019s just not that interesting. Especially when your co-workers are 90 percent salespeople.", "The best thing about having higher multiples is you can invest in infrastructure. You want to keep your customers around for a long time. A lot of the networks churn and burn because they constantly have to justify themselves. That\u2019s the hardest thing to deal with. Their investors need them to sell more advertising, quarter after quarter. There\u2019s no time to invest in infrastructure because there\u2019s no money in it.", "The typical life cycle of an ad network\u2014a couple of engineers get together and they have a good idea, something nobody\u2019s ever seen before. They work on it for about six months. Get some money in it. They slowly stop running on engineering and start hiring salespeople. They raise a B round and then it\u2019s over.

This likely forces the Entertainment Software Association, the trade group that organizes E3, to do some soul-searching about how to make E3 booths attractive for the remaining 200 or so exhibitors.", "The ", "$99.3\u00a0billion game industry", " (as market research Newzoo estimates) is stronger than ever, but a lot of people are wondering what\u2019s happening on the inside if so many E3 stalwarts are changing their plans.", "Citing its interest in creating fan events, Electronic Arts pulled out first, but said it would keep its press event and meeting space at E3. Activision Blizzard, Disney Interactive, and Wargaming have also pulled their booths. But ESA spokesman Rich Taylor says the group isn\u2019t worried. The senior vice president of communications spoke with GamesBeat on Thursday about the show\u2019s continuing relevance in an age of fan events, livestreaming, and social media. In fact, he argued that E3 serves as the epicenter for all of those things, and this\u00a0amplifies the show\u2019s presence around the globe.", "You wouldn\u2019t, for instance, see billions of media impressions about the show if there were no epicenter for it, Taylor says.", "Here\u2019s an edited transcript of our interview.", "Above: Rich Taylor, senior vice president of communications at the Entertainment Software Association.", "GamesBeat: I wasn\u2019t overly interested in the trend when EA decided to pull out of the show, but then Activision Blizzard joined and made me raise my eyebrows. I heard from Wargaming and Disney that they\u2019re also dropping out. Is this making you guys concerned?", "Rich Taylor:", " E3 is an evolving show. It\u2019s not the same year after year. Individual companies will make decisions for their purposes each year and each iteration. I\u2019d refer you back to the companies you named to see what their rationale is. But overall, you\u2019ve probably heard from many people that E3, for the past several years, has been among the best shows that anyone has ever experienced, including last year\u2019s show. E3 itself remains dynamic, invaluable, and the preeminent show of its kind in the world for video games, entertainment, and innovation.", "We have a record number of press briefings this year in the ramp up to opening the show. Folks recognize how valuable a launch pad it is and how being part of E3 adds rocket fuel to the attention and eyeballs and interest and visibility of the new titles and new hardware and new innovations that our industry produces each year. E3 is a strong, critical, and integral part of our video game ecosystem.", "GamesBeat: It seems like people are distinguishing among what sort of things they value now. The E3 booth has been described as very expensive. Press briefings, on the other hand, are something you see more of. We\u00a0also see a lot of livestreaming of events at E3. That probably has some kind of impact as well. Is there some special worry you guys have about the value people see in E3 booths?", "Taylor:", " No, not really. I\u2019m seeing some of the elements you talk about. The things you mention are all additive to what\u2019s happening at the show. The show is the core. The show gives folks great news to talk about and stream about and share. You look back a few years ago, VR wasn\u2019t present in the E3 world. Last year we had 27 companies showing VR at E3. I expect a similarly strong showing of that technology this year.", "It remains an important place to be. The amount of media impressions coming out of E3 is mind-boggling. The excitement that companies carry out of E3 is immeasurable. We dominate social media. We dominate a lot of traditional media during the show and in the aftermath. As a launch pad, it\u2019s without peer in this industry and in entertainment across the board.", "Above: Activision Blizzard won\u2019t have its booth again at E3.", "GamesBeat: Is there any reflection you guys are doing in the wake of these more prominent departures? Is there a conversation that\u2019s started about anything in particular?", "Taylor:", " Each show, we have conversations with attendees, exhibitors, the retail community, the media, and so on. Our goal is to always make adjustments to the show to make sure it\u2019s the highest value for all those who benefit from it or are designed to benefit from it. That said, that process is ongoing. We\u2019re listening and talking and asking right up to the time of the show. Then we\u2019re in full service mode during the show to do things on the fly and make it as high-quality an experience as possible.", "GamesBeat: Some people think an easy answer would be to go the way of Gamescom and let the public in on the last day, or extend it for a day or two. That may make the booths more cost-effective in terms of how much exposure they generate.", "Taylor:", " It\u2019s a balance. We look at it and talk about it. Last year we had a number of prosumers in the hall for the first time. Exhibitors were given allotments of tickets for their most valuable customers and that got a consumer element on the floor. We\u2019re likely going to do that again this year. We\u2019re always looking at other possibilities too.", "I don\u2019t think the answer is to roll up the bay doors and fire a starting pistol. It\u2019s something more strategic, done in concert with our members and exhibitors and attendees to make sure we strike the right balance whenever we make a change. That includes questions of consumer engagement and involvement. We\u2019re open to doing whatever it takes to make sure E3 delivers for exhibitors.", "GamesBeat: Is there any discussion about whether to change your pricing for show floor booths?", "Taylor:", " That\u2019s far enough into the weeds that I probably won\u2019t get into it in an interview. But it goes back to the general subject where we have conversations about all these elements. We never start with nine of the 10 E3 commandments chiseled in stone. It\u2019s a blank canvas, and we go from there to create E3 each year. Anything is possible if it makes sense and benefits the attendees and exhibitors.", "Above: EA will continue to have its press event at E3, but it won\u2019t have a booth.", "GamesBeat: If you step back and look at the broader outlook for trade shows, do you notice anything that\u2019s happening? The number of fan events is increasing. We see\u00a0a lot more livestreaming. I think that affects everybody in trade shows.", "Taylor:", " You\u2019d have to ask individual trade shows about what\u2019s going on with each one. Live streaming for us is just a way to expand our audience reach. It\u2019s an incredibly useful tool. It doesn\u2019t mean people aren\u2019t attending. It just means that you can reach people halfway around the globe who aren\u2019t present under the roof of the LACC. It\u2019s a great opportunity.", "The ability for live streamers and YouTube personalities to put in their piece \u2014 and social media in general \u2014 exponentially increases the impact of E3. If you look at our media presence, it outpaces the number of people on the planet in terms of media impressions. People are seeing news about E3 time and time again. That\u2019s a good story to tell.", "GamesBeat: Do you think the billions of impressions always need some kind of epicenter?", "Taylor:", " Yeah. It can\u2019t just be anything. It has to be a well-organized, well-run event. It has to be at the right time. It has to have infrastructure that allows people to deliver messages and exhibit things the way they want to and have some organization so people don\u2019t step on each other\u2019s messages. All the things that are part of our role. But what it also needs to have is incredible news to share and games to share and technology to share. All those things come together at E3.", "Every spring we have these conversations about whether E3 is still relevant. I\u2019ve had these conversations ever since I came on board. The usual result is a better show than the year before. I look forward to this same conversation next March or so, where we look at 2017 and talk about what a great show 2016 was.", "Above: E3 2013", "GamesBeat: We did have some very interesting conversations back around the time of 2008. What about this now takes you back to those years, where E3 went through an upheaval?", "Taylor:", " These are apples and very small oranges. There was a direction that E3 selected for a couple of years. We evaluated it and decided that it wasn\u2019t the right direction for the industry or for the show. We made the proper course correction keep it vibrant and keep it what it is. That\u2019s why we\u2019re in such a great place today, because we\u2019re capable of doing that. We\u2019ll do that over and over again and improve the show every year.", "GamesBeat: If people are worried that more companies will drop out, do you have any reassurance to offer them as far as the number of exhibitors you\u2019ll have?", "Taylor:", " You can throw out hypotheticals. I don\u2019t really want to get into that. I just have absolute confidence in the next show. I\u2019m excited as always, as someone who went to E3 before I ever had this job. E3 is still a unique place. I can\u2019t wait to see what\u2019s under the roof this year."]}

That dedication has made its fans look forward to every new Paradox release and those gamers continue to support older products by buying any new content add-ons. While publishers like THQ, Acclaim, and more have gone under by trying to fight against the biggest corporations in the space, Paradox has demonstrated a new model for the medium-sized gaming company.", "That momentum led to Paradox generating record sales of $71 million in 2015.

The unintended consequence of this pressure to deliver financial performance is that game teams can over index on generating revenue instead of delivering a better experience for players. For example, to meet short-term financial goals, the general manager of a game could turn up the monetization dials raise and thus grow revenue in a given quarter. However, not only would this revenue growth be short lived, but more important, it would also come at the cost of cannibalizing future quarters\u2019 revenue. Worse, if repeated often, regular turning up of monetization dials could destabilize the in-game economy and cause the eventual implosion of the game.", "Companies need metrics that can help them identify such patterns that could have impact on long term sustainability of their games.", "Existing operating metrics are lagging (not leading) metrics of business health", "Most game companies generally have robust revenue models that take into account historical trends on DAU, ARPDAU, and user retention; user acquisition forecast from the marketing team; content update plan and resulting impact on ARPDAU; user retention from game teams. These revenue models can be pretty accurate for established games over the short term as long as things go according to plan, which is not always the case \u2013 especially after major events like content updates or launches of new versions.", "Businesses have to come to terms with how DAU, ARPDAU, and ARPPU are the lagging indicators and often times, these will fail to forewarn managers of impending revenue decline.

In order to grow its revenue sustainably, game developers need to focus on growing player engagement and ensuring that entertainment price (revenue per hour) stays within range. Spikes in average revenue per hour are symptoms of a team growing short term revenue by increasing squeeze, which would inevitably be followed by engagement decline and revenue loss in subsequent periods. These spikes in revenue per hour should serve as an early warning system for an impending revenue decline in future periods.", "The engagement metrics should be the key part of the business discussions and review process within the game companies.

He explained that if you\u2019re in the store and find something you like, there\u2019s already a 30 percent chance you\u2019ll buy it, which goes up to 70 percent for items you try on in the fitting room.

Once implemented, it allows you to step into a booth that scans your measurements \u2014 in just three seconds. Bloom stated clearly that no images are being captured, just the up to 200 data points. With this information, you can go to the merchant\u2019s online store, sync with Avametric\u2019s database, and find clothes that match your style and fit.", "The scanning booth is about the size of a fitting room stall.

It won\u2019t be as accurate as a scan, but it\u2019ll get the ball rolling. The idea is that getting well-fitting clothes online makes people feel better about their purchases and more likely to shop online again.

The prevalence of the PD market       is expected to grow in the next years due to the increase in the global       population and advancements in healthcare that contribute to an aging       population at increased risk for PD. The diagnosis of PD is mainly based       on observational criteria of muscular rigidity, resting tremor, or       postural instability in combination with bradykinesia. As the disease       progresses, symptoms become more severe. Early-stage patients are more       easily managed on L-dopa. L-dopa remains as the most effective treatment       for PD, and over 75% of the patients with PD receive L-dopa. However,       long term treatment with L-dopa leads to seriously debilitating motor       fluctuations, i.e. phases of normal functioning (ON-time) and decreased       functioning (OFF-time). Furthermore, as a result of the use of high       doses of L-dopa with increasing severity of the disease, many patients       experience involuntary movements known as L-dopa-Induced Dyskinesia       (LID). As the disease progresses, more drugs are used as an add-on to       what the patient already takes, and the focus is to treat symptoms while       managing LID and the \u201coff-time\u201d effects of L-dopa. Most current       therapies target the dopaminergic system that is implicated in the       pathogenesis of PD, and most current treatments act by increasing       dopaminergic transmission that leads to amelioration of motor symptoms.       There is a growing belief that targeting non-dopaminergic systems may       lead to improvements in PD symptoms such as dyskinesia that are not       improved by current dopaminergic therapies.
