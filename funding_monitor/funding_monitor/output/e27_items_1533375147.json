When executed improperly, intrapreneurship can be a disaster for both the company and the intrapreneurs involved. I\u2019ve seen it from both sides of the table and have identified a set of key issues every company and intrapreneur should consider before embarking on their journey.", "There are different levels of intrapreneurship: Unofficial intrapreneurs are individuals in an organisation who take responsibility for driving end-to-end product development \u2014 potentially up to and including bringing the product to market. These are essentially the \u201cstar product managers\u201d in an organisation. In some instances though, these intrapreneurs may spin up independent businesses within the parent organisation. These quasi-independent intrapreneurship situations are the ones that have the most potential, but also pose the greatest danger.", "Keeping this in mind, here are the five most common issues plaguing intrapreneurship today:", "Intrapreneurs usually start out by identifying a new or previously missed opportunity for the parent organisation, and then pull together the resources to capture the opportunity. In these instances, the strategic alignment between the intrapreneur and the organisation is obvious. The problem is traditional entrepreneurs at the idea/seed stage rarely (if ever) make it to market with the original product they envisioned.", "As an intrapreneur, my team and I developed an interesting piece of advertising technology that modestly surpassed our industry\u2019s benchmarks. We soon realised the modest improvements we could deliver weren\u2019t compelling to our customers, but our ability to gather data across tens of thousands of websites was. Unfortunately, our parent organisation was averse to data-centric business models and we weren\u2019t given the freedom to pivot. Intrapreneurs are plagued with an inability to respond to the needs and demands of the market, which takes an already difficult task (finding product-market fit) and makes it almost impossible.", "Also Read: ", "Why companies should believe in intrapreneurship", "One of the few red flags that will always kill an investment deal with a venture capitalist is when a company\u2019s founders claim to be \u201cco-CEOs.\u201d This doesn\u2019t work. In the context of intrapreneurship, there are always multiple CEOs. At a minimum, there are two: the intrapreneur and the parent organisation\u2019s CEO. In some instances, there might be someone like a VP of Product, complicating matters even further.", "With multiple CEOs, strategy and priorities are bound to shift over time, and team members could get confused and ultimately frustrated with dealing with inconsistent leadership. The parent organisation\u2019s CEO of one intrapreneur I have worked with dictated a list of product development priorities to the intrapreneur\u2019s team, while the intrapreneur gave the team another set of priorities. In an environment like this, progress cannot be made.", "Top talent can choose between two kinds of companies: They can pick blue chip organisations, which while maybe less interesting can offer larger salaries and clear paths to advancement and stability. On the other hand, they can pick a startup where they will earn less in salary and where advancement options are less obvious, but they\u2019ll have substantial control over company\u2019s direction. Intrapreneurial companies usually end up with the worst of both worlds.", "As an intrapreneur trying to hire talent, I was always asked what kind of equity package we could put together for prospective hires. Unfortunately, the answer wasn\u2019t a particularly attractive one. This meant we couldn\u2019t attract the kind of diehard talent startups typically seek. Rather, we attracted people interested in a corporate culture. Without the tools or structure to hire and retain top talent, intrapreneurial endeavors are operating at a disadvantage from the start.", "Intrapreneurial companies have complicated capitalisation issues. Often, they are funded from corporate cash flows. This can be great when times are good, but it introduces uncertainties entirely outside the intrapreneur\u2019s control. If the parent has a bad quarter, funding may dry up for the intrapreneurial endeavor. Similarly, a slight shift in the parent organisation\u2019s priorities may result in engineers or other resources being taken from the intrepreneur and put into other projects. I\u2019ll admit that when I was overseeing intrapreneurial teams, I would occasionally \u201csteal\u201d resources for other projects I was working on. Even with the best of intentions, these kinds of resource shifts happen all the time.", "Also Read: ", "Corporates give startups needed boost in emerging markets", "If you\u2019re an intrapreneur and you manage to avoid all the above problems, you\u2019re then likely to fall victim to culture issues. Running an intrapreneurial endeavour inside a larger organisation successfully requires setting your own culture and following your own strategy. It might mean different face-time expectations, and it almost certainly means a more nimble operation. People in the parent organisation who are not part of the intrapreneurial endeavour could potentially develop feelings of resentment.", "Being an entrepreneur is extremely difficult, so it\u2019s not surprising many are attracted to the idea of intrapreneurship. It promises the same creative outlet as entrepreneurship with the stability of a traditional career.

From mobile payments replacing cash and credit cards to robo advisors competing with traditional financial advisors, financial products are increasingly inexpensive and user-friendly. Luckily for borrowers, consumer and business lending are also being revolutionised. How exactly are new lenders changing the game and how will you be affected by changes in the lending industry?", "One of the most disruptive ways fintech companies are changing lending practices is their use of data analytics. Lenders leverage data obtained from applicants in order to better predict the risk associated with each potential borrower. This approach can benefit borrowers in a few ways. First, it often allows for a simple online application and faster review process. For example, online lenders often require fewer documents and some lenders even offer application review decisions within minutes.", "Additionally, data analysis gives lenders more precision in their pricing, which allows borrowers to receive prices commensurate with their respective risk. Finally, thorough data analysis allows lenders to carefully examine loan applicants in a manner that allows them to offer loans to some applicants that are unable to receive financing from traditional lenders.", "While predictive analytics allow lenders to approve loans more quickly, electronic wallets and transactions allow them to disburse funds to borrowers more quickly.

But we still have a lot more to prove \u2013 we are so small compared to where we want to be. This really hit home the other day actually. I was in China yesterday to visit Alibaba HQ. Jack Ma was once an English teacher. After overcoming a TON of adversity, today he has 50,000 people working for him. 50,000! It\u2019s like a Chinese army, seriously.

I was 18 years old. If I had died, my life would have meant NOTHING. All my ideas would have died with me.

I was completely lost at the time and, to be honest, I wasn\u2019t sure if life was worth living. Nietzsche was a big influence. He said that masters are the ones who decide what\u2019s next. That idea really resonated with me. Most people drift through the day, and when you drift, you are at your most vulnerable. Someone will ask you at that very moment to do something that fits with their plan, and you respond \u201cSure, why not?\u201d because you are drifting. You don\u2019t have a plan.

I want to decide what\u2019s next.", "You talk about time a lot. You\u2019ve chosen to invest an inordinate amount of time into this company GetLinks to transform the way people work.

I meet so many people of all ages who are lost because they don\u2019t know what to do and they have no net. If GetLinks can achieve any one thing, it would be to empower people to take control of their lives. We will start with jobs, but in 2-3 years, GetLinks will be about lifestyle.

But I will say this \u2013 you can tell that Djoann has found his calling \u2013 you can feel the difference in him.", "Isn\u2019t creating a movement a bit clich\u00e9d by now too?", "DJOANN:", " It is a clich\u00e9, so we don\u2019t call it a movement. We call it a war. So many companies want to start a revolution these days, but they fail because they are not authentic. They are created by marketing people who know nothing about young people.

When I was sitting in the meeting room, I saw you putting your hands on shoulders left right and center. Is this a style or is it just you?", "DJOANN:", " I didn\u2019t realise! I guess I just want to give my team confidence. It took time for me to gain confidence myself \u2013 I went from an INTP to an ENFP \u2013 pure introversion to super outgoing.

For the past 15 years, Cradle has been at the forefront of this evolution. Incorporated under the Ministry of Finance Malaysia (MOF), Cradle is Malaysia\u2019s early-stage startup influencer with a mandate to fund potential and high-calibre tech startups through its Cradle Investment Programme.", "\u00a0", "Cradle\u00a0has thus far helped fund over 700 Malaysian tech startups and holds the highest commercialisation rate amongst government grants in the country. The fund also witnessed the birth and growth of several multi-million-dollar companies, and remain the key player in the startups ecosystem.", "e27", " recently talked to Cradle Fund CEO Nazrin Hassan to delve deep into the Malaysian startup and funding scene.", "Excerpts:", "It has changed tremendously since our inception in 2003. Prior to Cradle\u2019s birth, there was zero funding \u2013 be it from the Government or from the private sector for idea development and prototype development, especially commercialisation, there was little to none of that.", "Perhaps there\u2019s only two categories of people invested in startups \u2013 family or friends. Back then, there were no real angels. I think the first angel investment movements had quickly died in 2004, and there were no private sector money coming.", "\u00a0", "The venture capitalists were all playing at a later stage. ", "\u00a0 ", "They wanted companies to have revenues and traction. It is like an inverted pyramid, where you have very few primary schools but you have many universities. That was the situation prior to Cradle\u2019s\u00a0inception.", "\u00a0", "We came in and started providing prototype funding through our Cradle Investment Programme, and followed by CIP500, which aimed to help start-ups in commercialisation funding in 2010.

In addition, there are now quite a few\u00a0sophisticated investors, in the Equity Crowdfunding scene.", "There are quite a few VCs in town, but they prefer to play in later stages, from\u00a0Series B onwards. Right now, growing number of VCs are coming into investing in Series A. Given the fact that regional VCs are coming in from Singapore, Japan, the US, India and China, I don\u2019t think there is real shortage for funds, regionally.", "There are many VCs who are willing to fund Malaysian companies, particularly in Series A level.", "\u00a0", "When it comes to Series B, that\u2019s where we fall off a cliff,\u00a0from an\u00a0availability perspective. When I say Series B, I mean regional level Series B. The local Series B is about RM 5-20 million. When it comes to regional Series B, there is not much money available.", "As for\u00a0angels and seed stages, investors are gradually growing. There are almost 200 registered angels and 6 ECF. As you said, ECF platforms are becoming more popular. What entrepreneurs like about\u00a0them\u00a0is that it\u00a0is easy access to a fairly large amount in a fairly short amount of time. Dealing with VCs over here usually takes anywhere between three to nine months, but when you deal with ECF platforms, it can be as soon as three months.", "There are several reasons for that. I think in Singapore, there are certain natural advantages: it is an international financial centre. In Asia,\u00a0it\u00a0is\u00a0second to Hong Kong as far as parity and competition are\u00a0concerned.", "The other reason is that Singapore is a very open economy, which allows foreigners to come in and dominate the market \u2014 be it in employment or entrepreneurship.", "I think it is harder for its\u00a0neighboring countries to do\u00a0so, because we are still protecting our local market, employees and entrepreneurs. Even if we are taking about VC, there are only three key hubs in Asia \u2014 India, China and in Singapore.", "Having said that, however China and India have natural advantage, as they are continents from a size and population perspective. Singapore it\u2019s because it is the leading hub in Southeast Asia with a 650 million population.", "To me, I have never looked at our ecosystem competency with Singapore hub but rather, we should leverage from them. People are themselves based in Singapore because of attractive tax regime and it is a good place to base yourself when you also need matching funds from government. This makes Singapore very attractive space to base your VC firm.", "However, the\u00a0spill-over effect can be felt all over the region because, even though they have seven times more VCs than Malaysia, all these VCs need to look at regionally to deploy their money. They need to look at Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand and Indonesia.", "Anything that Singapore creates or starts, the effect will affect the rest of the region. I never believe in competing with Singapore on that front. I think we should leverage on Singapore because it is a small country, which doesn\u2019t have a big indigenous population. It is an advantage for the rest of the region.", "\u00a0", "We measure different products by different metrics. For example, in prototype funding, it is measured by our commercialisation rate, which means how many of them go from ideas and concepts to actual market commercialisation.", "We\u2019ve benchmarked the definition of commercialisation against the US, which means that they actually have to reach the market either from the sales traction, sale of the IP or licensing perspective. As far as commercialisation is concerned, I would try to track from the beginning of the programme until now, which is about 64 per cent and that is over a period of close to 15 years. So, literally two out of three ideas that come to us actually hit the market. Given that, we fund in the hundreds of ideas, that\u2019s not a bad number at all.", "For our commercialisation funding, basically more than one out of five of the deals that we funded at commercialisation level, actually received VC investment or corporate investment from other entities.", "\u00a0", "Therefore, in that sense, given the shortage of available capital, it\u2019s not bad at all. ", "\u00a0 ", "Ever since we\u2019ve started on", "\u00a0 ", "our equity deals, we\u2019ve just had a recent exit on a company. I can\u2019t disclose the name of the\u00a0firm, but we definitely have made more than five times our money, within a period of two and a half years.", "Well, the thing is this: unicorns are more usually are born in countries with vast population. If you look at countries that produced unicorns, they are either based in countries like the US, India or China where the population is big and where the ecosystem is fast growing. Some of the unicorns in the market were born in Europe because\u00a0they managed to explore the global market. It is still a very elite club. Only one of out of every 200 startups is unicorn.", "I don\u2019t think there will be a deluge of unicorns coming from Malaysia, given the size of the population and given the difficulties of startups to penetrate the rest of the regional markets. I am sure Indonesia will probably create far more, given the size of the population.", "Having said that, however, Malaysia is a bit more like India, where we have started many startups and bigger players eventually acquire these startups. We are much more like India in a sense\u00a0that\u00a0the whole bunch of internet millionaires have quietly exited between US$20 million and US$50 million.", "When I look at Malaysia, we are probably going to build the sort of companies, which are valued at RM 50-100 million. I don\u2019t think there will be a deluge of unicorns. Grab was an exception. It was born here and eventually moved to Singapore. If there are any more unicorns, I don\u2019t expect it to be in large numbers.", "Well, the government is very proactive in many ways via the Secretary General of the Ministry of Finance Tan Sri Dr. Mohd Irwan Serigar Abdullah and agencies like\u00a0", "MaGIC", ", many others and ourselves.", "Also Read: ", "Opportunities abound, but Malaysians need a better mindset in order to build global firms, says Matt van Leeuwen of Sunway iLabs", "I think Malaysia has always been open to the entry of foreign investors. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever had a protectionist stance in that sense. Foreign investors and PE players are always welcome. I think slowly we\u2019re embracing the fact that startup teams have to be diverse and international. We cannot expect a startup to only be made up of Malaysians, so we acknowledge that the need for diversity in each of these startup teams, so we are getting to be more open.", "But if you ask me if Malaysia is as open as Singapore, the answer is no. I am\u00a0being realistic here.\u00a0I think Malaysia\u2019s first priority is that local startups do well. We don\u2019t mind to have diversity of other international startup/talent, but the focus has to be on the success of local startups. We want our local startups to do well.", "Well, I think the\u00a0challenges for local startups are manifold.", "One, for any startup, to get into much more attractive growth and valuation, it cannot simply remain in the Malaysian market. It has to be a regional company at the very least.\u00a0It must have presence in at least three to four countries around Southeast Asia, if not beyond.", "If you have notice, scaling in Southeast Asia is almost like a black box. Each country is at a different economic stage, each country speaks different language, different political and economic development stage.

On an IoT platform that is run real-time, businesses are able to run millions of transactions gathered from distributed machines. It is bound to produce plenty of logs; if the system implements a transactional model that has to be managed in a centralised mode using middleware, there is a strong possibility that it will be slow and costly.", "Behind its decentralised nature, blockchain also presents several risks that need to be understood. A blockchain-based system is considered \u201copen\u201d; in this context, there is no customer protection guarantee as in a decentralised process (i.e with Bank Indonesia as regulator). All transactions are managed in the public domain, with the risk of customers\u2019 data privacy not being taken care of.

Therefore, for the future massive implementation of blockchain, there are many tasks left to do, particularly by monetary system regulatory bodies.", "Another crucial point that needs to be looked at is the testing and validation of the promised benefits of blockchain technology. Starting from that point, the government needs to adjust regulation and set up law enforcement rule to support existing system.

For some, the deal portrays the classic underdog story, a sort of David and Goliath-esque plotline with the local hero successfully fending off a Western conquistador. For others, Uber\u2019s fate had long been set in stone with the new executive leadership in place and their intent for a 2019 IPO, and of course a gentle nudge by shared investor Softbank. Whichever narrative you choose to read, let me be clear, above all else this is a win for Southeast Asia.", "With this deal, Grab has not only validated the Southeast Asian market, but validated the appeal of home-grown startups in the region. Let me explain what I mean. Once a consumer startup achieves product-market fit and starts scaling across international markets, it\u2019s competitive advantage is usually derived from two primary factors: capitalization (funding) and localization (understanding and tailoring to customers\u2019 needs). For a segment with as razor-thin margins as ride sharing, especially in this part of the world, the weight between the two hovers roughly around 80/20, according to a former executive at Uber.", "Indeed, Grab was able to outpace their Silicon Valley counterpart on both fronts. Think about that, a native Southeast Asian startup was able to outgun the world\u2019s most valuable tech startup and arguably the pioneer of ride-hailing in terms of both money and execution. Almost makes you wonder what other startups in this region are capable of.", "One of the primary concerns of VCs is the ability for their portfolio companies to attract follow-on capital and eventually drive towards a liquidity event. This is a pervasive sentiment among investors, but especially so in Southeast Asia where the startup ecosystem is still comparatively young, with the majority of funding focusing on early stages. Thus, simmering investor anxiety often revolves around whether or not native startups can attract capital to support later stage growth, especially from sources outside the region.", "Well, the story of", " Grab\u2019s funding cycles", " says it all:", "Collectively, Grab has been able to nab close to US$ 4B in funding to-date at a US$ 6B valuation, wooing several international investors such as Softbank, Tiger Global, Honda, and Didi. When you stack that amount against the US$ 700M that Uber had invested in Southeast Asia, the story of Grab\u2019s ability to maintain a competitive edge against its Silicon Valley counterpart becomes much more evident.", "The extra ammo gave Grab the means to rapidly launch in more cities, while maintaining massive subsidies and marketing campaigns to sign on more drivers and riders.", "Also read: ", "Grab acquiring Uber\u2019s data trove is a major red flag. Here\u2019s why", "Granted, Uber could\u2019ve very well allocated more time and resources in Southeast Asia, but it would\u2019ve been hard to justify given all the other battles that the company was fighting", " both internally and externally in 2017", ". Now, with new executive leadership and fresh sights on an IPO in 2019, Uber\u2019s sell-off is certainly a sensical move and leaves the company with a rather material 27.5% stake conceivably worth US$ 1.6 billion\u2013and counting!", "If nothing else, the landmark deal signifies a tip of the hat towards Grab and the value proposition upon which it was built, which was completely designed by Southeast Asians, for Southeast Asians right from the outset.", "Interestingly enough, the localization aspect is what has been emphasized the most among news outlets, despite ultimately having a much smaller impact on Grab\u2019s dominant market positioning. But, for good reason, as it\u2019s a much easier theme to sell and actually inherently much more interesting.", "When Grab\u2019s co-founders Anthony Tan and Hooi-Ling Tan first conceived the startup in 2012, they had set out to solve one simple, yet pervasive problem: make taxis safer and more reliable (hence the company\u2019s original name MyTeksi).", "Starting off with taxi hailing allowed them to not only leverage existing taxi fleets and scale very quickly across the region, but also brand themselves as a more low-end, budget-friendly type of service compared to Uber who entered the market from the opposite spectrum with private cars. This more \u201capproachable\u201d perception was further bolstered by Grab\u2019s support of cash payments, which was critical in gaining early traction given", " Southeast Asia\u2019s largely unbanked and lower-middle class population.", "In extremely congested cities like Jakarta or Hanoi where the quality of your livelihood oftens depends on the amount of time sitting in traffic, Grab (along with their Indonesia rival Go-Jek) was quick to offer motorbike-hailing services throughout 2014 and 2015, whereas Uber was slightly slower to enter the space.", "The Grab app itself also featured minor tweaks that appealed to local consumers such as passenger-driver texting channels, automated translations, and in-app safety mechanisms. Although rather trivial in the grand scheme of things, these features highlight the team\u2019s ability to empathize with their user base and anticipate their needs, both now and in the future.", "Southeast Asia is set to boast a US$ 200 billion digital economy by 2025, according to the latest report by Google and Temasek. But it\u2019s also an extremely heterogeneous and fragmented region. Grab has proven that home court advantage and local knowledge are a critical assets when it comes to unlocking the region\u2019s riches.", "The story of Grab\u2019s ascension actually aligns quite well with historical precedent. Asia has been borrowing concepts from the West and reinventing them to fit local context for centuries. Japan has been the foremost example of that, having imitated and subsequently reinventing everything from French Education to American corporate efficiency.", "In the tech world, these trends have stayed consistent. Tencent\u2019s WeChat has completely metamorphosized from a mere messaging app into an all encompassing lifestyle platform offering shopping, payments, and entertainment\u2013all in one app! Meanwhile, China\u2019s popular delivery startup ", "Meituan-Dianping has already plotted out its entry into the ride-sharing segment. ", "We see Grab currently moving in a similar direction. In terms of transport, they\u2019ve matched every one of Uber\u2019s service offerings, and then some. Now, they\u2019re expanding into a whole suite of services including food delivery, mobile, and micro-loans, all effectively built on the back of their expansive regional ride-sharing network.", "Also read: ", "Looking under the hood: How Grab\u2019s data science team optimises a fleet of 2.4 million drivers", "Meanwhile, Indonesian rival Go-Jek, currently valued at roughly north US$ 3B, has already branched into lifestyle services including on-demand cleaning, beauticians, auto repairs, and massages, in addition to their iconic bike-hailing platform.", "It\u2019s clear that these two Southeast Asian startups have taken the concept of ride-hailing and reconstructed its core vertebrae into an entirely new genre that seamlessly fits the region\u2019s needs, while still eliciting the appeal of world-class investors.", "If there was any residual doubt about the competitive capabilities of Southeast Asian startups and the viability of the market following Sea\u2019s public debut on the NYSE last year, hopefully they\u2019re now put to rest with the advent of \u201cGruber.\u201d", "\u2014-", "Editor\u2019s note: e27", "\u00a0publishes relevant guest contributions from the community.

Fueled by technological advancements and cheap funding, startups and established companies alike have been creating innovative ways of making people\u2019s lives more convenient.", "As e-commerce permeates more deeply and widely into our lives, it is bound to have a lasting impact on the way real estate market has functioned for a long time. Because physical proximity to certain services have been crucial factors that determined where people want to live, the way e-commerce renders distance to these services irrelevant will change how people think about real estate.", "One of the most important aspects of our lives is food. In that sense, people want to live close to grocery supermarkets, hawker centres and restaurants to ensure they can easily consume what they want when they want it. To make this demand easier to fulfill, new online grocers like Redmart have been providing affordable online grocery shopping experience in Singapore. Now, even traditional players like\u00a0", "FairPrice", "\u00a0have been stepping up their game to allow consumers to get groceries without leaving their homes.", "For example, most supermarkets now offer free delivery for orders bigger than S$40 to S$59, which is a significant improvement form\u00a0", "last year", "\u00a0when many players required a higher minimum order of S$100. Same can be said of food delivery from restaurants. As these services will improve over time, many consumers will no longer feel the need to live close to amenities like supermarkets that have been regarded thus far as a necessity.", "Another concern that people have when moving to newly developed or distant areas is the lack of access to public transportation. However, with likes of Grab and ofo providing cheap and easy modes of transportation, many consumers will no longer need to have a private car or access to public transportation to decide where they want to live. For example, we\u2019ve calculated that using ride-hailing apps like Grab every day is actually more than 10 per cent cheaper than owning a car for an average consumer in Singapore, after accounting for\u00a0", "credit card discounts on petrol", "\u00a0and Grab rides.", "Even if hailing a Grab ride were too expensive for you, you can still benefit from even cheaper versions of these services like carpooling. Furthermore, bike-sharing services are great alternatives for covering short distances, as they tend to be\u00a0", "cheaper than MRT rides", "\u00a0for short trips that take about 10 to 20 minutes on the metro.", "Also Read: ", "Sustaining the magic associated with starting up as you grow", "Spending on these \u201conline\u201d services allows one to claim\u00a0", "credit card rewards", ", so a consumer would favour these options over using EZ-Link to pay for public transportation, which often doesn\u2019t qualify for cashback. Not only that, development of self-driving cars has the potential to reduce the cost of these services even further, which could completely rule out access to transportation as a factor impacting real estate prices.", "The next big step in the \u201ce-commerce\u201d revolution is probably going to be in education. Singaporean parents are well known for being heavily invested in their children\u2019s education, and have shown willingness to move to get access to better schools and teachers. What if schools instituted an online teaching programme where every math class in Singapore were taught via a live video of the best teachers in the country, with assistant tutors onsite to help students individually? It wouldn\u2019t make every school exactly the same, but it would surely level the playing field and reduce the temptation to move to a district with better school systems.", "As an increasing number of online services make life more convenient for people, consumers are likely to change how they think about where they live. If access to supermarkets, restaurants, MRT or schools no longer mattered, consumers would be more than willing to live in neighbourhoods that were previously viewed as less than ideal. Just such an area tends to be Built-to-Order (BTO) flats in Singapore. BTO projects tend to be 20-30% cheaper than resale flats in similar neighbourhoods because they do not readily have easy access to vital services that we listed above. In fact, BTO prices tend to appreciate and catch up to those of resale flats precisely because these services get established in the neighbourhood over time.", "What if the physical location is no longer the constraint that prevents these services from being easily accessible? If people could easily receive grocery deliveries at home even if there were no supermarkets nearby, many more people will be willing to live in BTOs than before. In fact, this is precisely what has been happening to cities like\u00a0", "New York", ", where Uber has positively impacted the real estate prices of neighbourhoods that were previously viewed as being inconvenient because they were far away from subway stations.", "If pain points around daily necessities like food, education and transportation were solved through online services, BTOs and other homes at previously inconvenient locations could become better\u00a0", "investment opportunities", "\u00a0than previously realised and appreciate in price.

If you are interested in this type of investment, it is helpful to research the various platforms in order to make a good choice. For the most part, you should be considering the same criteria that you would for any investment opportunity, including costs, returns and potential risks.", "In this article, we highlight the most important factors for differentiating between crowdfunding platforms as an investor.", "Before you make a decision about a\u00a0", "crowdfunding platform", ", you\u2019ll need to explore the investment opportunities available from each site. Crowdfunding platforms in Singapore offer a range of investment opportunities including real estate investments, small business loans, equity investments, invoice financing and asset purchase agreements. You should understand the risk and reward profile of each type of investment before committing your funds to a crowdfunding campaign.", "Invoice financing and asset purchase agreements are typically the least risky investments, as they require that the borrower has completed work or has a specific use for the funds. Because of their low risk, these investments also offer lower returns than other opportunities. Small business loans are more risky, in the sense that they provide financing for general purpose work without a specific use.", "This means that business loans also offer investors slightly better interest rates, on average. Real estate investments vary greatly in risk, but tend to offer lower risk than equity investments, as they are based on tangible assets that can be sold in case of default. Equity investments offer the highest risk, and therefore highest potential returns, because they are based on the success of a company, and can result in high returns or the failure of the business.", "High returns might be the reason that you became interested in crowdfunding in the first place. Small business loans tend to offer annualised returns of up to 25%. Invoice financing and asset purchase financing tend to offer annualised returns as high as 20%. Annualised\u00a0", "real estate investment", "\u00a0returns vary greatly depending on the specific type of investment. There is no ceiling to returns from equity investments, but they are also the most risky investments available from crowdfunding platforms because if the business fails, investors get nothing.", "Some investors will naturally be cynical of the relatively nascent phenomena of crowdfunding. How can investors be comfortable lending through these platforms to businesses that were not eligible for more traditional forms of financing?", "First, investors can review or request more information from crowdfunding platforms, such as their average default rates. The best platforms offer default rates as low as 1.3 to 3.5%. These rates are comparable to those of commercial banks and should give investors confidence to invest. Other performance statistics to consider include percentage of on-time payments and total number and volume of deals completed. Not all platforms are open to disclosing their data, and it would be prudent to invest with platforms that provide statistics about their performance on their websites or through their customer service teams.", "Also read: ", "5 tips for successfully marketing your crowdfunding campaign", "Similar to\u00a0", "brokerage accounts", ", most crowdfunding platforms charge a service fee to investors. Some platforms charge very low fees or no fees at all. Others charge 1 \u2013 8% on all repayments received or 18 to 20% of interest earned. Investors should have an understanding of the fees that they will be required to pay and how much these fees cost in relation to their expected returns. Since most of these investments last a few months to a year, minimising your fees per investment could actually add to a meaningful amount of savings.", "For example, assuming that a 1 year investment earns 20%, fees of 1% of total repayment will be the least expensive (1.2% of initial investment), followed by fees of 18% of interest earned (3.6%), 20% of interest earned (4.0%), and 5% of total repayment (5.18%).", "Platforms have varying minimum investment requirements. Therefore, you may be forced to choose a platform based on the amount of cash that you have available to invest. Crowdfunding platforms that offer small business loans, invoice financing or asset purchase agreements generally require that individual investors commit at least S$100 \u2013 S$1,000 per campaign. Equity and real estate crowdfunding investment platforms tend to require more substantial contributions per investment opportunity, typically at least S$5,000.", "Additionally, the top equity and real estate crowdfunding platforms require that investors are accredited, meaning that they must have net personal assets of S$2 million, with their primary residence value accounting for no more than S$1 million, and an income of at least S$300,000.", "\u2014-", "This article was originally published\u00a0on\u00a0", "ValuePenguin", ".", "Editor\u2019s note: e27", "\u00a0publishes relevant guest contributions from the community.

He was thinking of doing the Paktor (which is a colloquial Hokkien term for dating) idea and he came to me, so we decided to do it together.", "To me, I\u2019m an engineer by nature. I thought it was an interesting problem space. Because the way I see it is before dating apps, how people meet their other halves is more or less by chance.", "So if two of you meet in school or meet at work, you get thrown into your class or faculty or your job. Socially, it\u2019s relatively random and I think technology can do a better job of matching people.", "To illustrate, let\u2019s say right you meet a friend through school, maybe the only thing you have in common is your PSLE score or your O\u2019 level score, right? And maybe roughly where you live.", "In the online world, we know much more about you. And the \u2018class-size\u2019 of people is also bigger. So I think on that basis, online can serve as a better matchmaker than the Ministry of Education or the workplace.", "First, we use machine learning to check whether an image that is uploaded is of a real person, or is there is nudity, for example.", "Another way we use machine learning is to figure out what kind of people you like. This is similar to Amazon or Netflix\u2019s recommendation algorithm.", "Also Read: ", "Top reasons why we download dating apps but neglect using them afterwards", "For example, let\u2019s say you liked person A, B, C, D and E and a new user comes and likes person A,\u00a0B and C.

It is based on users\u2019 reaction to each profile.", "Another example is if you match with person A, B and C, but only talk to C, we will try to find profiles similar to C for you \u2014 this is based on their profile info, such as age.", "Not from what we see. The survey that the ", "Singapore government did in 2016", " actually showed that compared to 2012, more people dating seriously now. In 2012, it was 38 per cent and then in 2016, it was 41 per cent, so actually, there is a\u00a0significant increase.", "That is a good sign on our part. I think there have been articles that suggest otherwise. But from what we see in our survey data, and what we see in our own data, having increased choice leads to more matches not fewer matches.", "From what we see, people who find matches on Paktor generally stay off Paktor after that. To us, that is a sign that is quite serious and long-term. And also for our offline dating service ", "Gai Gai", ", quite a few are resulting in matches and marriages already.", "I do understand the initial reaction: it\u2019s just an app, so it\u2019s casual. But I don\u2019t think this impression or reaction is justified by the data. All the data that we have seen, have shown otherwise.", "There are a few ways to do it. If you look at our marketing message, we never promote or try to encourage hook-ups. We actively try to discourage it because we think it\u2019s still not socially accepted.", "We try very hard to incentivise to meet-ups offline. For example, We encourage users to go to our offline events, we encourage them to go on dates and also send them recommendations on places to hold their dates. We also have a feature called \u2018fading matches\u2019, this means you have to talk to matches within 48 hours or else it disappears.", "But it\u2019s an uphill battle, because people are quite shy. So we introduced gifts, allowing users to send images to each other, which helps break the ice.", "Our perspective on localisation \u2014 or rather culturalization \u2014 we think dating as a very culturally sensitive activity. I think each country has their own challenges and needs. When we go to each country, we will try to figure out the similarities and differences between the countries we are in and the countries we are going in to.", "So, our feature sets for different countries are actually different. For example, in Korea, we had a feature that ranked the hottest people. This feature turned out to be more popular in Korea than in Singapore.", "More people in Korea ended up using the app because of it because they wanted to see who was more popular. That feature was not popular in Singapore so we didn\u2019t end up rolling out [officially] in Singapore.", "Our marketing messages and content are also heavily localised to local festivals and seasons. Like Korea, we run summer events; we don\u2019t run that in Singapore because it is pointless.", "And the difference is not just across countries but across platforms. For example Android users, they react more readily to discounts, and guys and girls react differently. So it\u2019s about customising to the platform and genders as well.", "Dating starts online but it ends offline. When we started GaiGai in 2013, people weren\u2019t that accepting of online dating yet. Many who are looking for matches and dates still go to offline services. That was the genesis of the offline arm.", "We don\u2019t see ourselves as a purely online or offline company. Lessons we learn from the online platform actually feeds into the offline platform and vice versa in the way we conduct the business.", "The largest Gai Gai event was in the USS aquarium where we had 300 singles. On a regular basis, we hold 4 to 5 events every month. There are several pricing models, such as \u00e0 la\u00a0carte and\u00a0other dates package deals.", "For the near future, Paktor will stay focused on matching singles that is our core competence and our core product. We will add in elements of entertainment as a means to help people match up and not as an end.", "We still want people to come to Paktor to meet new people. We don\u2019t want to come to Paktor for entertainment. No, that\u2019s not our goal. However, we do want to make Paktor entertaining enough to make it easier to meet other people.", "Think about it like this: Some people meet new friends in bars and clubs but they don\u2019t go there just to meet people; it\u2019s because the drinks are good, the music is good, the ambience is good, etc. We are thinking of it from that angle.", "So as we continue to develop Paktor\u2019s user experience, we will curate more interesting, entertaining things \u2014 online equivalent of \u201cdrinks\u201d.", "A basic one would be playing games online. We know online games\u00a0are a big category of entertainment, so we can engage our users in games online and through games meet each other. That is what we are trying to do with some of our gamification features.", "Not in the near future. While we do think that any online interaction, games as an example, can lead to romance. We believe a more targeted and purposefully designed tool like a dating app has a higher success rate than if you leave it to chance, like a Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG).", "Also Read:\u00a0", "The Jay Kim Show: Dawoon Kang of Coffee Meets Bagel talks dating, entrepreneurship and Mark Cuban", "So Paktor as a company, we have a dating line and a live streaming line. The live streaming line is laser-focused on live streaming. We are taking lessons from both sides on how people get to know each other, and what people want to know about each other and apply these lessons to both business lines.", "There will be more synergies in the future. It is possible to have live streaming features on Paktor. The way we see content is that text is the least engaging form of content, followed by pictures, video, then livestreaming.", "So we think live streaming is probably the most engaging form of content out there right now. Whether we integrate live streaming tech as a tool to help our dating platform is a question for the future.", "Not at the moment. The near future is about geographical expansion, building more services and improving current products. Korea is the furthest country we have expanded to.
