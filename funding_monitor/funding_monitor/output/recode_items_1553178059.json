Media is supposed to have now fallen out of favor after being in favor, but there are a couple of startups, like yourself, a couple specifically in sports that are interesting to investors right now, so we\u2019ll talk about all of that. Good?", "I\u2019m good, yeah. ", "Deal?", "Deal.", "Okay, let\u2019s start with Overtime. I wrote about this, I think about a year ago, when you raised your first round. It\u2019s an interesting idea. Will you tell people what you think it is?", "Yeah. With Overtime, we are trying to build the biggest global sports network in the world. ", "It\u2019s called ESPN.", "No. It will be called Overtime.", "Okay, got it. That\u2019s the big mission statement. ", "And also, by the way, none of the ones that you will mention are global in nature because sports is governed by rights and every sports league sells its rights to different publishers in every territory. We don\u2019t focus on right space content, so we are trying to build something that is truly global and a distributed sports network, meaning we\u2019re on every platform you can imagine, YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitch, TikTok, anywhere that we can be, and we are specifically geared towards kind of the generation Z audience, or the audience that has fallen off from watching traditional live sports, which is the way that I grew up.", "And what you\u2019re also focused on, at least you were a year ago when I was spending time looking at you, was high school sports and high school athletes. There are other high school sports sites and they\u2019re focused on scores or trying to figure out who\u2019s going to get recruited to whomever. That\u2019s been around for a while. You said, no, these are celebrities. People like Mac McClung. Did I get his name right?", "McClung, yeah.", "McClung. Zion Williamson, who you\u2019ve probably heard of now. You guys were taking footage of them in high school and the crazy dunks they were doing, etc., and then distributing that around the internet.", "Yeah.", "That was kind of your main sort of focus a year ago. ", "I would say some of that is correct. We don\u2019t have a site because young people don\u2019t go to websites, sorry Vox. ", "I\u2019m just nodding.", " ", "Yeah. I don\u2019t really cover high school sports. ", "You don\u2019t cover, you cover high school athletes, star athletes. ", "We cover the most dynamic young people across sports. What are the four verticals? Basketball, football, soccer, and video games. The video game folks that we cover, it has nothing to do with high school sports. Soccer is global, there\u2019s no high school soccer in America that\u2019s left at any level. They play in academies and stuff like that. Football is very much driven by high school and basketball is primarily driven by club sports, and now we have rights in college as well. So our focus really is kind of finding the 30 or 40 most dynamic young people who have a chance to be pros and following them. ", "And I make that distinction because typically, \u201chigh school sports\u201d has literally covered the school and the teams and it\u2019s been about feeding content to parents. So for us, we set out to say, our goal isn\u2019t to have parents as an audience, our goal is to make a sports channel for the next generation. ", "I knew or had an instinct from running the digital talent business at WME, which is a global talent agency, that part of the reason all these YouTube stars were so popular is that people like to watch young people who are like them, who they feel they can relate to and aspire to with less distance between them then there is between them and, let\u2019s say, LeBron James, and those people typically are 17, 18 years old. But we don\u2019t do scores, we don\u2019t say who won, we don\u2019t say what place they\u2019re in, we don\u2019t do playoffs. ", "It\u2019s, look at this crazy thing, 15-second clip of someone doing something amazing, usually on a court. ", "It\u2019s true, but almost every clip is tied to a character that you\u2019ve been following all along. So if you sent me an amazing dunk and said, \u201cYou should post this.\u201d I most likely would say, \u201cNobody knows who you are.\u201d It\u2019s not about the highlight, it\u2019s about the ongoing story. In a weird metaphor, I think about what we do as almost like ", "Saturday Night Live", ".", "I was going to say ", "The Real World", ". ", "Yeah. Every year there\u2019s a cast, and sometimes those cast members move on and sometimes they don\u2019t and you tell essentially a global story around them. You follow those characters and then sometimes you follow them as they go on to do other things. ", "That\u2019s where we started. We covered Trae Young, who\u2019s on the Atlanta Hawks, who\u2019s having a Rookie of the Year season. We did our first show with him when he was in 11th grade and now he\u2019s an NBA player and we just shot more content with him. So it\u2019s really covering those kids, but it\u2019s having a relationship with them on their journey as our audience moves with them, too.", "So whether it\u2019s ", "The Real World", " or another analogy, most places, when someone is a star or a YouTube vlogger, there\u2019s a direct relationship with money at some point. At some point, they\u2019re getting paid, and in most cases, with the high school athletes you\u2019re talking about, you\u2019re not paying them. In fact, they ", "can\u2019t", " be paid if they\u2019re going to go to college, right?", "Correct. Correct, I don\u2019t make the rules around eligibility and NCAA, but yes, and I think many people feel that they should be paid. You can go pro in golf or tennis when you\u2019re 13 years old and it doesn\u2019t have a problem, but you can\u2019t do that in basketball or football. Our value transaction with them is, we help build their brand, we put forth 100 percent positive coverage of them. There\u2019s no gotchas, there\u2019s nothing on there, and as a result, somebody like Mac McClung who might have started with 20 or 30,000 followers, by the time he got to college, he had three quarters of a million followers. ", "Where\u2019s he at, Georgetown now? ", "Yeah, he\u2019s at Georgetown, playing for Patrick Ewing. And that\u2019s an asset for him. It means whether he makes the NBA or not, he has a platform and that\u2019s a direct result of essentially the value exchange between us and him. ", "Just to be clear, you can\u2019t have contracts with these guys even though they\u2019re not financial, right?", "No, no, no. You just cover them. ", "You say, \u201cHey, Mac, we\u2019re going to take a lot of footage of you.\u201d", "ESPN doesn\u2019t have a contract with KD or Steph Curry. ", "Right. They ", "do", " have contracts with the leagues. They pay a lot of money for those rights to show those clips. ", "For those rights, correct. Yeah.", "And what you\u2019ve done is, you have cheap/almost-no-cost content, which I get the appeal of that, for a media startup. ", "There\u2019s a level of cost in the sense that our business is based on the fact that we have 2,000 stringers across the globe, anywhere from Lithuania to France to Denmark, primarily in the United States. ", "A stringer is a kid with an iPhone. ", "Yeah, a kid, community college student, 22, 23, 17. We have our own proprietary software we spent two years building. On the front end, it allows seamless capture of highlights and upload, even in low network situations, it tags them, and then on the back end, we ingest a quarter of a million clips fully tagged with games and players every year.", "And we say, go to the game, take footage, focus on Mac McClung or Ryan Williams, whoever the Lithuanian is, and send us your best stuff. ", "Well, they don\u2019t send it. ", "It gets uploaded, yeah.", "I can literally sit at home and watch as clips come in in real time. We have various people who publish for us and they see it and they\u2019re like, \u201cWow, that\u2019s an incredible play,\u201d and it\u2019s on the internet in one second. And across essentially non-professional sports where these kids are playing \u2014 AAU basketball or club sports or high school sports \u2014 nobody has ever really in real time covered that. That was really our advantage. It was the breadth and the speed. ", "I get it\u2019s not zero cost, but still very low cost, right? Because again, you\u2019re not paying Mac McClung...", "You\u2019re not buying rights, correct. ", "So you don\u2019t have to pay the NBA any money.", "Yeah. ", "I get the appeal of that. I get the model of that, and I can see why that would be a venture business. And then on the end of it, you distribute your stuff, not on a website \u2014 Instagram, Twitter, etc.", "Right. We have multiple accounts on every single platform. ", "And then that stuff gets picked up by other outlets like House of Highlights, The Bleacher Report Instagram account, or ESPN. Everyone who wrote about you said, \u201cOh, look at this Mac McClung dunk,\u201d which ended up on SportsCenter. ", "So I get the appeal of why you would want to distribute this stuff broadly, ", "but", " a couple of years ago I was like, \u201cYes, you must distribute all your stuff broadly on all the social networks and YouTube,\u201d etc., and now everyone says, \u201cWell, but you don\u2019t actually make money there and there\u2019s lots of problems there and you don\u2019t control that and they\u2019re not actually in the business of helping their media partners, necessarily.\u201d So how does that work for you guys as a business?", "Right. And people say that because they have that very traditional old-school mentality about media. I would say in the very beginning, when there were five of us in a room and almost every highlight was shot by one of the five of us on an iPhone, we would capture stuff of a Zion Williamson in the 11th grade or any of these other people, and all the folks you mentioned, ESPN, Fox, NBC, other folks, would come and say, \u201cHey, can we license this footage from you? We\u2019ll pay you $500 or $1,000.\u201d And I said, \u201cYou can actually have it for free as long as you leave our watermark on it.\u201d And so when we were no one, everyone was blasting our content all around the internet and investors used to say, \u201cWow, I see you guys everywhere.\u201d ", "Well, they didn\u2019t see us with our 2,000 followers, they saw it elsewhere, but that was a value transaction and in return that\u2019s built us millions and millions of followers. So now we don\u2019t ", "need", " to do that. It\u2019s beneficial to have them share it, but I think you have to think about it in different ways. What you\u2019re talking about is primarily short-form content, and short-form content is not a big moneymaker. It does two things. One is, it introduces you to a bunch of these characters and then we have 13 series on YouTube and four series on Snapchat, so that\u2019s the long-form content. You can watch them there. They\u2019re playing in airports all over the place. ", "And just to be fair, long-form on YouTube or Snapchat means seven minutes?", "It\u2019s anywhere from eight to 22 minutes. But the real value is that what you\u2019re building is, you\u2019re building a highly engaged community. And so there\u2019s this perception of media which is, I make this thing \u2014 it\u2019s a video, it\u2019s a podcast, it\u2019s something else \u2014 I push it out there and then people that I don\u2019t know sit out there and watch it and then they move on to consume the next thing. ", "For us, what we\u2019re really trying to do is build a highly, highly engaged community. As an example, I was at the NBA All-Star Game where I saw you and I met ...", "That is a cool name-drop, huh?", "Yes. You or the All-Star Game?", "Both. ", "And I met a person who is very, very high up at one of the large social networks and that person said \u2014 didn\u2019t know who we were \u2014 that person\u2019s son was there and said, \u201cOh, my gosh, Overtime. I watch you guys all the time.\u201d We sent them a T-shirt and a sweatshirt and that person sent me an email today and said, \u201cMy son has not taken off this sweatshirt since you sent it to him.\u201d ", "I don\u2019t think that that person would\u2019ve felt the same way if you sent them a sweatshirt from five other media companies that I could name because those people focus on pushing content out, they don\u2019t focus on building community. I have full-time people on the athlete relations side. We have people who respond to hundreds and hundreds of DMs a week, who comment, who engage with the people. ", "There\u2019s a whole segment of people who love Overtime only for what goes on in the comments. We have roast battles where our people will actually literally roast kids in the comments and they turn that into a show. So it\u2019s not an accident that I ran a community gaming site for five years and a lot of the value was in that community and in that network.", "Let me just accelerate a little bit. Let\u2019s say everything\u2019s going great for you and in the next couple of years you keep getting bigger and bigger and building more audience and more community. In the end, you still need to generate revenue, right?", "Correct. ", "Especially the model we\u2019re in now, where investors are less interested in what you might become and you still have to prove out a business.", "For sure. ", "So you are going to make money how?", "Yeah. I would say two things. I will definitely tell you how we currently make money, which is how we will also make money in the future. But I will also say that instead of launching a media company where we went into a highly commoditized area, news, technology, where we had nothing original to say and we couldn\u2019t point to any audience segment that we own, instead we went into a traditionally sleepy and less exciting area, high school sports. We made it, in the words of my children, lit, and we own that audience segment. ", "So when large media companies look at us, does it matter if we do a billion views or a billion and three views? What matters is that we have captured the young people. So some of the people who used to share our content won\u2019t even share our content anymore because they\u2019re threatened by us. They see that we have aggregated this group that they cannot aggregate and that\u2019s really different and that\u2019s valuable. ", "We make money in three ways. No. 1, we work with brands. We do millions of dollars of brand revenue already. ", "So they are paying you to make what?", "They sponsor shows that we make. They want to reach ...", "Such as \u201cour show, brought to you by Gatorade.\u201d", "Yeah. ", "Yeah. ", "They want to reach our audience in a way that seems authentic and organic. We first started working with endemic brands to sports apparel, Gatorade, other folks like that and have grown beyond that. ", "The second thing is, we\u2019re very focused on commerce. We have generated substantial revenues in selling apparel. We have over 25 SKUs we release every season.", "Sweatshirts.", "Sweatshirts, T-shirts, shooting sleeves, socks, everything. We act like we are building the next Nike or Adidas. It works because of the same reason that you might wear a Patriots jersey or a Giants jersey or a Mike Kafka Eagles jersey.", "There you go. You got it. ", "Because you want to represent. And I think that\u2019s a large extent of why people wear our apparel. We seed it with athletes and influencers and it means something in the world. Commerce isn\u2019t something that we got 10 years into our business model and we\u2019re like, \u201cWe have to sell stuff.\u201d That was built from day one. ", "And then the third is experiential and live. Ultimately, our big big-picture goal is to start our own league so that we don\u2019t have to buy rights and then we can be fully vertically integrated. Until we get to that point, we will start doing tournaments and events and other kinds of sports IP that we can create and own globally.", "So, I\u2019ll talk to you a little bit more about this after the break, but before we get there, just one big-picture question, right? Hack journalism requires a rule of three, right? Then you can call something a trend.", "Yeah.", "So partly because it\u2019s selection bias, right, I\u2019m looking at them, but I\u2019m thinking of you, The Athletic subscription sport site, and now what is Action Network, which is gambling. There all different businesses, but they\u2019re all sports-related. They\u2019ve all attracted venture money recently. Is there something thematic about sports do you think that\u2019s interesting to investors now or that\u2019s just randomly three different companies that have seemed appealing?", "Well, I would say in terms of gaming, which is the euphemism for betting, sure. I mean, that is a huge transition in this country that will be ongoing.", "We have legalized gambling now.", "Yes.", "Legalized sports gambling.", "In person. In person.", "Yep.", "In person. Yes.", "In person in different states.", "Yes. I would say in general, sports is amazing because it\u2019s such a large vertical. It\u2019s filled with an enormous amount of passion. Sports is an ongoing news cycle. I could get into food and I could tell you, \u201cPeter, I have a brownie recipe.\u201d And you\u2019re like, \u201cWhy now? I mean, I have brownie recipes.\u201d Or, I could tell you, \u201cI have this kid, he\u2019s 17, he\u2019s explosive, he\u2019s going to be bigger than LeBron.\u201d Those are two different things. ", "Sports is really tough because I\u2019d say about 80 percent of venture investors have no interest in sports whatsoever. They make sports jokes. \u201cSportball! I get it, you guys are playing sports.\u201d", "You mean they are nerds or nerd-adjacent and they don\u2019t actually like sports.", "That was said by you, but something to that extent. So, it\u2019s actually pretty challenging. We found some investors who like the market dynamics, but I would say ...", "Oh, by the way, if you watch a Golden State Warriors game in the front row is full of dudes who ...", "Sure, right, Ben Horowitz, my investor.", "... presumably like sports.", "Yes.", "Right, there you go.", "So there are people, and that\u2019s why they\u2019re one of our investors. And I think they get it. And the thing about sports is, if you go to a movie or you watch a TV show, the ending is always going to be the same. Whereas you watch a game, anything could happen. So I think there\u2019s interest. But the fact that all three of those were funded, I think is probably just a coincidence. They just represent different parts of the market dynamic.", "Thanks for blowing holes in my bullshit trend story, Dan Porter. One other question about Overtime. This is something that you are the CEO of. Your co-founder\u2019s half your age?", "He is exactly half my age. He\u2019s 25.", "How do you meet a co-founder half your age and how did the two of you decide to build a business instead of making a buddy movie or something else? Something unseemly, maybe.", "Yes, that\u2019s a good question, and he\u2019s a tremendously smart individual. Zack Weiner is his name. We met because initially when I was working at WME, William Morris Endeavor, I just had an early glimpse into the fact that the younger audience wasn\u2019t watching live sports anymore.", "And your job at William Morris was to do what? ", "I was the head of digital. So, I ran the venture fund. I did all the digital strategy. I built the digital talent division. I worked on podcasting, virtual reality, anything digital was like ... broadly across the whole agency. ", "And subsequently after I started working there, WME acquired IMG, which is a big sports rights agency and I also worked on digital there. And so, I was seeing in 2013, 2014, that various clients, leagues, other people were pointing out, they were coming to us and saying, \u201cWow, can we work with your digital talent to re-engage kids in sports and live sports?\u201d ", "And that\u2019s a whole other podcast discussion. Why aren\u2019t they watching live sports? Any number of reasons. They don\u2019t want to sit in front of a TV for three hours. It\u2019s slow. It has commercial breaks.", "They don\u2019t have cable.", "They can watch Ninja play ", "Fortnite", " on Twitch. They can watch ", "Game of Thrones", ". They don\u2019t have cable. There are a million different things, but the fact is that it\u2019s true and the joke is that parents would say, \u201cWell, my kid will never have a TV in their room growing up.\u201d And of course, they have a phone and a computer and multiple screens. But, they\u2019re just watching other stuff. ", "And the other thing is, well, kids have short attention spans. I watch my fill-in-the-blank friend/nephew/niece/child scroll through Instagram. Well, they\u2019re watching shows. They just have short attention span for old-people content that hasn\u2019t changed in 30 years. But my kids who are 17 and 20 will watch lots of shows that are just formatted better for them. ", "So, I knew that there was an opportunity there, but I knew that I had certain advantages. I knew how to build a company and a platform, but I knew I had limitations too and that I\u2019m not the target demographic. And I had not built something in sports. So I asked a guy. I went to Princeton and I asked a younger guy who went to Princeton, who I had met through Startup, if he knew anyone. That kind of younger guy, Josh, had gone to Stuyvesant with Zack, my co-founder, and they had ...", "A New York City high school. ", "Elite", " New York City public high school.", "They had both been on the chess team. Yes, they took the ", "SHSAT", ", got in. And so, through this Facebook post, he introduced me to Zack. He\u2019s like, \u201cOh, I know this old guy who wants to build a company around sports and I know this young guy who had started a sports company in college.\u201d And he introduced us and we just had a lot of chemistry around our shared vision.", "So, he was how old when you met him? He\u2019s like 25 now, right?", "He was probably 22 when I met him. ", "And did you have to broker that through his parents? It just seems a little eyebrow-raising.", "I did not. He\u2019s a very mature, amazingly brilliant individual.

", "Sure. The first thing I\u2019d start with is protecting your time and attention.", "Mm-hmm. ", "I gave a talk, this Ted Talk, a number of years ago called \u201cWhy You Can\u2019t Get Work Done at Work Anymore.\u201d And the whole premise was that we work all day. We\u2019re at work all day, but we\u2019re in meetings all day and our time is scattered. Right?", "Yeah.", "We have 15-minute blocks of time. You can\u2019t get really good, thoughtful, creative work done in 15-minute blocks of time. So you might be at work for 8 hours, but you have maybe if you\u2019re lucky 17 minutes to yourself in a given day.", "Right.", "And so then you have to work the weekends. You have to work at night. That\u2019s why you get work done on planes, because no one\u2019s bothering you, and whatever. So, for us, the most important thing for me as the business owner is to make sure I\u2019m protecting my employees\u2019 time and attention. If they can\u2019t have a full eight-hour day to themselves, I\u2019m making a mistake, I\u2019m not doing my job. ", "So for me the goal is to make sure that we have full eight-hour days to each person so they can control their day themselves. So we have no corporate meetings, no company-wide meetings at all. We don\u2019t have any meetings. We don\u2019t share schedules. We can\u2019t see each other\u2019s calendar. We can\u2019t do any of the things that makes it easy to take other people\u2019s time from them.", "Right. ", "So in the book we talk about ...", "Time thief.", "Everyone\u2019s a time thief.", "Time thief.", "We talk about this in the book. We call it calendar tetris. ", "I won\u2019t let anyone in my calendar.", "You look at someone\u2019s calendar, some blocks of color everywhere, and you\u2019re trying to fit some slots in, right?", "Mm-hmm.", "So that\u2019s a problem. The fact that you can see somebody else\u2019s calendar is a problem. It should be hard to get someone\u2019s time. Modern technology\u2019s made it too easy to get on someone\u2019s schedule, and to claim, actually not even claim to steal time from them. If I wanna block an hour of your time, if you and I work together, I could go look at your calendar, invite you, you\u2019re probably gonna say yes because most people don\u2019t say no. And then before you know it your day is not yours anymore, it\u2019s someone else\u2019s. That\u2019s a problem.", "Mm-hmm.", "You cannot be expected to do great work if you don\u2019t even own your own time. So for me, owning time is ... Owning my own time and making sure my employees own their own time is very important. No meetings. No calendar. Expectations: huge.", "Okay, so before I finish that \u2026 when you don\u2019t have that, there ", "are", " some things you do need to talk about.", "Sure. So, if I need to talk to someone, I have to ask them.", "Ask them for time?", "Yeah.", "Which is what people do. Oh, don\u2019t grab it. Don\u2019t grab ...", "Yeah, yeah. Different. So it\u2019s like, \u201cHey Kara, are you free at 3 o\u2019clock Thursday to talk about something?\u201d And you can, we can have a conversation about that. And then you\u2019re in control of your own time. You can go, \u201cYou know what, how about Friday at 1,\u201d or something like that, versus me looking at a grid of your time and then just taking it without any humanity involved or any conversation involved.", "Right. Yeah. Yeah.", "It\u2019s funny, because companies, they always talk about \u201ctime is money.\u201d They don\u2019t leave money out on the table, though. But they leave time out on the table. You can take anyone\u2019s time you want. You cannot take a penny, though. And they have comptrollers and CFOs. And everyone\u2019s watching the money, no one\u2019s watching the time.", "So that\u2019s what happens, is people\u2019s time is taken from them because no one\u2019s watching it. No one cares about it.", "And so it\u2019s direct calling or texting or whatever?", "Yeah. You could ping someone, you could email \u2018em, you can go through Basecamp, you could talk. Whatever it is, however you wanna get in touch with someone, you ", "ask", " for someone\u2019s time. Someone\u2019s time is valuable. Of course you should ask for it. And you should respect that someone else\u2019s time is valuable and they\u2019re probably doing their own thing so you better be polite when you ask.", "Right.", "And make your case, not just claim a block. So that\u2019s how that works.", "All right.", "Most of the time though, still, we don\u2019t talk directly to one another in real time. Most of the time is asynchronous. So I\u2019ll post a message in Basecamp and someone will get back to me when they\u2019re ready. So this comes back to the idea of the expectation of immediate response. In a lot of companies today there\u2019s an expectation of an immediate response.", "Yes.", "That\u2019s broken as well. If I write something to someone and they get back to me four hours later, that\u2019s cool. I\u2019m fine with that. They get back to me tomorrow morning, I\u2019m fine with that. Unless it\u2019s an emergency, which should never happen anyway. People get back to me when they\u2019re ready. I\u2019ll get back to them when I\u2019m ready. That\u2019s the understanding we have at Basecamp. And that\u2019s a cultural thing, and it\u2019s really important. A lot of things in many companies are elevated to ASAP all the time, everyone thinks everyone\u2019s in a hurry, and there\u2019s no hurry. There\u2019s really no hurry.", "Right. Right. Right.", "It\u2019s fake.", "I don\u2019t answer my email anymore.", "You shouldn\u2019t.", "I don\u2019t.", "There\u2019s no reason to.", "Everyone\u2019s like, \u201cYou didn\u2019t answer my email.\u201d I go, \u201cI didn\u2019t see it.\u201d", "\u201cJust email me again then.\u201d Well I just delete mine like every ...", "It\u2019s like, \u201cYou didn\u2019t read it?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cI did not.\u201d", "No.", "\u201dI shall not search for it, either. Just send it again.\u201d", "Yes.", "You know, if you\u2019ve managed to find me this quickly ... It\u2019s really a funny reaction I get.", "The great thing about it actually, what\u2019s cool is when you ignore your email, if it\u2019s important, someone will remind you again. If it\u2019s not, it\u2019ll just go away. And that\u2019s pretty much what I do.", "Yes, it\u2019s true. It\u2019s true. There\u2019s very few things that rise to the ...", "Need to know now. Need to respond now.", "Need to know now. It\u2019s interesting. All right, so you don\u2019t let ... people respond in their own time in a message, asynchronous. ", "Yeah, asynchronous, primarily.", "Where did the ASAP culture come from? Just because these apps and everything are so, \u201cHello. Hello. Hello.\u201d", "Oh, it all ties back to business model, I think. I\u2019m gonna kinda fall back to VC, right?", "Go right ahead.", "But basically it\u2019s like, when companies raise a bunch of money, they\u2019re expected to grow really fast. And when you\u2019re expected to grow really fast, you\u2019re expected to go really fast. And when you\u2019re expected to go really fast everything\u2019s just ASAP. That\u2019s just the expectation. And it all comes down to expectations. We\u2019re used to texting in our daily life, which is fine with our friends and whatever. You don\u2019t expect an immediate response from your friend, really, necessarily. But at work, for some reason, it\u2019s expected because this is important, these people are waiting on you. And there\u2019s so many interdependencies at companies that if you take two hours, then everyone else has to wait two hours. ", "And so that\u2019s another thing I think is wrong in modern workplaces, is that there\u2019s far too many interdependencies between departments and people. I think people should be able to slide by one another rather than grind their gears. So for example, at Basecamp all of our teams are really small, three people or fewer. No two departments really depend on each other to get anything done. You never have to wait around for someone else to do something for you, you just figure it out yourself or you don\u2019t do it at all.", "Mm-hmm. Give me an example.", "These autonomous small units. For example, any programmer at Basecamp can ship software to the public. In a lot of companies ... and some people would say that\u2019s reckless. Okay, I\u2019d say it\u2019s a trade-off. In many companies you submit your software, some other engineer looks at it, some other engineer looks at it, some operations person looks at it, it\u2019s scheduled for deployment, so there\u2019s all these things in the chain that have to happen on time, and everyone\u2019s waiting for each other to get something out. We just, we trust everybody who works for us. Everyone\u2019s really good, and they get to the point where they can ship their own software and it\u2019s just done. They can handle it themselves.", "Mm-hmm. ", "So that just makes it easier. They don\u2019t have to ask someone else for their time. That other person ...", "Cause a roadblock, or a funnel, or whatever.", "Yeah, there\u2019s so many roadblocks.", "Yeah.", "The gatekeepers and roadblocks, just get rid of \u2018em, don\u2019t need \u2018em. Don\u2019t need \u2018em.", "Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah.", "And that doesn\u2019t mean that some things don\u2019t go wrong sometimes. It\u2019s just a matter of trade-offs.", "Or how many things go wrong versus ...", "And most things don\u2019t go wrong.", "Yeah.", "And most things don\u2019t matter anyway.", "You are correct. ", "So if there\u2019s a problem, you deal with it and you fix it. But to think about, the cost of preventing every potential problem is so high compared to just letting a few problems happen and then getting away with all these other things for free, which I much prefer.", "Right. Good point. Ask for forgiveness, not permission.", "That one. Yeah, that one. ", "That one. That one.", "Yeah, that one.", "How did it get to be crazy? So, one was, is it tech, or what is it? It\u2019s just the ...", "Tech. Tech\u2019s at fault. And by the way, some of these things are good sometimes.", "Right. Give me something good.", "I mean, look, real-time communication, for example, is handy sometimes. When there\u2019s really a crisis or whatever and you really need to hash something out, fine. It\u2019s just that when you have to follow a dozen real-time conversations all day long, that\u2019s broken. That\u2019s just broken. That\u2019s like, the fear of missing out. We have what we call JOMO, the joy of missing out at Basecamp. We want people to miss out. I want you just to focus on your work. You don\u2019t need to pay attention to a million things that are going on at once, right?", "And so, you look at, you walk around coffee shops or you look in offices and you see a chat window open all day long. And their right eye is looking at that while they\u2019re trying to do their work with their left eye.", "Mm-hmm. Yeah.", "And something else happens over here and they\u2019ve gotta jump over here. Now they\u2019ve stopped the flow, and they\u2019re over here now responding to something one line at a time coming back, a new ...", "It\u2019s like being pecked to death.", "It\u2019s being pecked to death, that\u2019s a great way of putting it.", "Yeah.", "And it\u2019s like, it\u2019s bonkers. But tech enables it, but also I think the tech company mindset ...", "Which has infected everybody else.", "Yes, it fertilizes it. And then it grows into this really horrible monster.", "Mm-hmm. ", "Yeah. And everyone\u2019s trying to be a tech company. Everyone\u2019s trying to model themselves after Silicon Valley companies, which I think is just a terrible idea.", "All right, we\u2019ll go into that in a minute. So what is another thing that happens?", "What do you mean?", "In the workplace. What is another thing that makes it crazy?", "Yeah. Well, other things that make it crazy, I mean ...", "Or that you get rid of to stop being crazy so it doesn\u2019t ", "have", " to be crazy.", "Yeah. One of the things that\u2019s really difficult, I think, for a lot of people is to work on something that never ends. A lot of projects at companies, they have deadlines but no one believes them. We call them \u201cdreadlines.\u201d", "You have these phrase-y...", "It\u2019s fun, right? There\u2019s a deadline, and then there\u2019s a dreadline.", "You should sell your consulting for a lot more money than you do.", "No thank you. No, I probably couldn\u2019t, by the way.", "Okay. I\u2019m just telling you, you could make some money.", "No interest in that world. Used to do that. Not what I want to do.", "It\u2019s free advice. ", "Free advice is better. So anyway, deadlines, dreadlines. Dreadlines are deadlines that no one believes, that never seem to end. Projects keep going and people pile more work in and more work in and more work in. It just drives everybody nuts. It\u2019s like, \u201cWhen\u2019s this going to ship?\u201d And, \u201cOh my God, I thought it was going to ship Friday and it\u2019s not going to ship Friday. They want us to do more stuff. Now we have to stay the weekend.\u201d And like all this false urgency that piles up makes people really, really crazy at work. ", "So we have this thing at Basecamp where we only work on something if it can take six weeks or less. If it takes longer than six weeks, we don\u2019t do it. We break it into a chunk that\u2019s six weeks max. That way, even if you hate what you\u2019re doing, it\u2019s almost over before you started.", "Also, we don\u2019t plan. ", "I like it.", "Yeah, this is another thing we don\u2019t do. We don\u2019t plan. We have no goals. We have no revenue targets, no financial goals other than to be profitable, and no growth goals, no user growth. None of that stuff. I think that\u2019s another thing that makes people crazy. ", "So just, let\u2019s see how we do. ", "Let\u2019s just do our best work. We should be doing our best work anyway, so let\u2019s just do that. Versus like making up some bullshit number. Like, \u201cLet\u2019s do a whatever, x million something this year.\u201d If you either hit it, great, then if you beat it, then it wasn\u2019t high enough. If you hit it, fine, then you make up another one next year and if you don\u2019t hit it then you feel bad. Like, why put any of those pressures on you? Just like do the best work you can and you\u2019ll be fine. ", "The problem is, though, that expectations are so out of whack for so many people because you\u2019re often working for somebody else. You\u2019re not working for the company or for the customer. You\u2019re working for a billionaire who wants to get a little bit richer off you, and so growth of multiples, valuations, all the stuff, that\u2019s what drives people crazy because they\u2019re aiming for that to move those numbers. And when you\u2019re ...", "You don\u2019t mind measuring success, right? Like, \u201cWe did better this year than last year in this\u201d? You don\u2019t even ...? ", "Well, I know it. ", "If you stop doing something, if you start really losing money, then why even be doing it?", "Yeah, yeah. ", "Unless you really super enjoy it. ", "I\u2019m not. Yeah, I\u2019m not encouraging people to lose money or hemorrhage money. We pay attention to that. But, for example, if we didn\u2019t grow one year, eh, whatever. If we only grew 3 percent one year? Whatever, who cares? That\u2019s fine. If we lose a percent? It\u2019s fine. Like, it\u2019s fine. It\u2019s not fine if we\u2019re down 80 percent, like that\u2019s not fine. Right? But that doesn\u2019t happen. ", "I mean, it could certainly and to every company it will at some point, but as long as we\u2019re just moving in the right direction, as long as we\u2019re profitable, as long as we keep our costs in check, I\u2019m fine. So we\u2019ve been profitable every year for 20 years and that\u2019s how long we\u2019ve been in business and that\u2019s the goal for us. If there is a goal, it\u2019s just remain profitable, which means that if we\u2019re profitable, we can stay around as long as we want. And that\u2019s ...", "But you don\u2019t have goals of hegemony? You don\u2019t have any of those? ", "No, absolutely not. Completely against that. ", "You have to remove the hegemony part. ", "You have to. And that\u2019s the other problem, I think, with a lot of things in Silicon Valley and of the model that\u2019s sprung up there, which is world domination, which is hegemony. It\u2019s having massive influence. It\u2019s dominating a market. It\u2019s owning the market. It\u2019s all these warlike, bellicose terms, and it\u2019s like, \u201cWe\u2019re going to conquer this, we\u2019re going to take that.

Go for the ankles.", "Take that right off, right. ", "Anyway, let\u2019s not talk about murdering tech executives. So give me one or two more and then I want to talk about VCs in the next section, but talk about a couple more.", "Crazy things?", "Yeah.", "Another thing that bugs me are specifically like tech benefits, benefits and quotes. So there\u2019s many companies out there that will cook you dinner at night or do your dry cleaning. Those are all ...", "And they become expectations of pretty much everyone in tech. ", "Yes. All those things are designed to do is keep you at the office longer. That\u2019s crazy. ", "Right, they are. ", "It\u2019s not about going home. It\u2019s about, \u201cWell, don\u2019t go home.

And people are beginning to realize that.", "Yes, 100 percent.", "And actually, what\u2019s kind of interesting is if you think about the cigarette business way back when ...", "Addiction, power, and ...", "Centralized control.", "Centralized control, yeah.", "I think, yeah, I think, manipulation, I don\u2019t know. I made them up, but manipulation, power, addiction, strong centralized control. Anyway. Think about the cigarette industry, which of course is a shadow of itself, at least in the United States, what people got pissed off about was that Philip Morris knew cigarettes were dangerous, but they didn\u2019t tell anybody. They knew the signs, and they withheld it, right? That\u2019s what people are really pissed about. It wasn\u2019t that people chose to smoke and that these cigarettes were addictive, it\u2019s that someone knew they were addictive and they didn\u2019t tell you.", "And then they used culture to get you to smoke, and movies and advertising.", "Yeah.", "Right?", "But I think it was the secret \u2014 that they knew \u2014 that really pissed people off. And I think what\u2019s very interesting is, if you look at social media right now, let\u2019s talk Apple for example, which is not social media but the phone, right? Actually, both iOS and Android have a Screen Time-style component. ", "To me, in many ways, this is these companies recognizing how dangerous these behaviors are and saying, \u201cWe don\u2019t wanna be Philip Morris. We know the shit\u2019s bad. We wanna help you try to control this from the start so you don\u2019t hold us responsible 20 years down the road,\u201d when we realize that 150 dopamine hits a day to your brain has caused brain damage or has caused, who knows what it\u2019s gonna cause in 30 years.", "Right.", "So it\u2019s very interesting that they\u2019re, I think, ahead of this curve. They\u2019re pretty much ahead of this curve compared to the traditional addictive industries. ", "But to get back, that was an aside. To get back to your point, so first of all, you can bootstrap, or you can take a business, sort of a side business from that business, that\u2019s what we did. We were a consulting company, built the software on the side, didn\u2019t have any expectations for it, turned out it was doing better than our consulting business about a year and a half, two years later, so we ditched consulting and been doing software ever since. So we funded ourselves in that respect. ", "But there\u2019s a new wave of ... I wouldn\u2019t call it VCs because they\u2019re not venture capitalists, so much, but they are people who can provide bootstrap funding, let\u2019s call it. You\u2019ve got Indie.vc, you\u2019ve got Tiny Seed, you\u2019ve got Earnest Capital, there\u2019s a number of them. And they\u2019re coming out and coming around to give people like 150 grand for six months or for a year. Basically saying, \u201cYou\u2019re running a side business right now. If we could give you a full year\u2019s salary, essentially, to dedicate yourself for a year, let\u2019s see what you can do with that.\u201d And then taking a small piece of the company. A few percent. ", "And that to me is interesting. That\u2019s not the million, billion-valuation thing, that\u2019s like, \u201cCan you turn a bootstrap company into something?\u201d As a funder, we would take \u2014 I\u2019m not saying \u201cwe\u201d but one of these people funding \u2014 would take dividends. So there\u2019d be an LLC, for example, and we\u2019ll take dividends. So if you have 150,000 bucks left over at the end of the year and we own 5 percent, we get 5 percent of that as a dividend. We\u2019re gonna make our money back on dividends, not on the big huge mass. Maybe there\u2019s gonna be one or two that turns out to be a big thing, but for the most part, we wanna help you grow your company, maintain control of your company, and we\u2019ll take dividends as a form of repayment.", "Which is in fact ... So, Jeff Bezos, we have no investors, Jeff Bezos did buy a piece of our company in 2006. He bought it from me and David. So none of his money ever went into our business, it went to me and David to put money in the bank. We\u2019re an LLC. So people always ask us, \u201cHow does Jeff get his money back? You guys said you were never gonna sell your business, you don\u2019t wanna acquire anyone, you don\u2019t wanna be acquired, you don\u2019t wanna go IPO, how is he gonna get out?\u201d Well, he\u2019s getting out every year because we\u2019re very profitable and he gets a slice of that money every year, a nice slice of money every year, and he\u2019s been in this 12 years now.", "Why did he go into it?", "To invest in us?", "He just liked it. It\u2019s just like him, I could see him.", "He just liked what we were doing. We were doing something very different back then and he was into it.", "Oh, I could see him. I can see him back then doing that, too. Yeah.", "Yeah. I don\u2019t know if he does that much anymore. He probably wants to make big huge bets now. But ... no?", "I don\u2019t think so.", "That\u2019s cool. I haven\u2019t talked to him in a few years. So he makes money on the dividends and that\u2019s a wonderful method of actually making money off of investing in companies, is making it slowly just like the company makes it slowly. And being invested along with the company: when they make money, you make money.", "Right, you get a piece. Yeah, I get it.", "That\u2019s fair. I like that model. And there\u2019s a number of them bubbling up right now, we\u2019re actually gonna be supporting some of them. So we\u2019re gonna put a little bit of money into a few different funds.", "So that they become LLCs and then they\u2019re distributed money. Just distributed profits.", "Yeah. Yeah.", "And then some of it, you put back in the business, presumably.", "It\u2019s up to you. It\u2019s all, LLC all the profit\u2019s taxed at a personal level. So if you wanna throw some back in, of course you can do that.", "Right, but you\u2019re operating, you\u2019re covering your costs, so it doesn\u2019t really matter.", "Right, exactly.", "Right. Right. Right.

I am not a fan of deferred living. And that\u2019s what that is. Basically, that\u2019s let\u2019s throw it all in and one day, we\u2019ll be huge and we\u2019ll sell it and we\u2019ll get rich. But what if you don\u2019t? Mostly, you will not.", "Right.", "So why not take a piece as you go?

I think you point out, I think the conversation around how we fund our companies is a timely one, and I think it\u2019s one that people have been either actively avoiding or actively ignoring for a long time. I think we\u2019re starting to see the ramifications of how we not only fund, but all of the load that comes along that\u2019s baked into that structure is really starting to come home to roost. We\u2019re hoping that that\u2019s not only a conversation that we can have and be a part of instigating, but that we can start to move that conversation out of the back rooms, where it\u2019s been for a while, and start looking at alternatives to how we think about funding these businesses.", "So, let\u2019s give people a little bit of context.

What we were trying to do was actually a little bit of what we\u2019re trying to capture with Indie.vc. Seed investing wasn\u2019t necessarily considered traditional investing, right? We had created funds and fund structures that were designed to function in a universe that VCs couldn\u2019t operate in at that time.", "So, we created small funds to fund companies that didn\u2019t require much cash up front to be able to build something that was scalable, and then they could choose to raise money or ...

That\u2019s exactly right. What you were also seeing, though, was that if you structured your fund in a certain way, and if you raised less capital for your fund versus more, you could unlock venture-level returns at that sub-hundred million dollar acquisition level. So, I think, why we look and sound like conventional, traditional VCs now is because seed, in many respects, has kind of been ... has essentially co-opted the traditional venture business model.", "And a seed round used to be a couple hundred thousand dollars, and now seed rounds are millions of dollars, or at least have been recently.", "Yeah. Average seed round of 2018 was two million, and it\u2019s on a hockey stick.", "Right. So, if you get it traditionally right now, the standard model for a startup company is to go and try to raise money in the seed round. That\u2019s a couple million dollars. And eventually, you plan on raising tens of millions of dollars, and eventually you want to become a unicorn, which means you\u2019re valued at a billion dollars or more, and then you sell the company to Microsoft, Google, Facebook, or you take it public. That is the traditional ... the new new normal.", "Yeah.", "Theoretically.", "Theoretically.", "What you\u2019re arguing is ...

So, I think, in the same regards that VCs want to fund billion-dollar, monopoly-style businesses, they have themselves a monopoly on the language we use about entrepreneurship, the archetypes they highlight as the ideals for entrepreneurship. And, as a result, we\u2019ve looked at anything that diverges from that narrative as less ambitious, less worthy. I think part of what you\u2019re seeing in that consolidation around seed investing is that we now think that the only thing we should be funding is something that ", "a priori", " to product, to revenue, to any of that stuff, is the belief that it can become billion-dollar businesses.", "It\u2019s really ... They own the language around that. What we were trying to do with Indie.vc is to say, at the earliest stages, that we think there\u2019s value in shifting your focus to that sequential fundraise of seed, series A, series B. Oftentimes, especially in the early stages, the goal of a round of funding is to set yourself up to be in a position to raise that next round.", "Right.", "Oftentimes, that next round still isn\u2019t predicated on actual fundamentals, it\u2019s predicated on your ability to keep telling a bigger and bigger story about what it is you\u2019re trying to build.", "Right. You want to get progressively bigger, tell a bigger story, and raise more money, and then, eventually, it ends when you succeed wildly.", "Yes. So, the radical move that we\u2019ve made with Indie.vc is we\u2019ve said that model works for a few, and I think if you look at the numbers, the number of companies that actually achieve billion-plus dollar valuations on paper and liquidity, tends to be ... Over the last few decades, it tends to be in the 10 to 20 companies a year achieve that. So, what about all those other companies? You\u2019re talking about not just all companies that get started, but 99 percent of the companies who actually raise venture capital don\u2019t achieve that.", "But can still be successful businesses.", "But they can\u2019t be considered a successful business when the only definition of success is a billion dollar exit, in that sense, right?", "Right. So, the derisive term that people in the VC world, in that world, describe ... Basically, anything that\u2019s not a billion-dollar company is a \u201clifestyle business.\u201d", "That\u2019s right.", "It\u2019s meant to be an insult.", "Yeah. It\u2019s meant to be an insult, and I think what we ... One of the problems we were interested in at least experimenting with Indie.vc was to say, \u201cOkay, what if we shifted our focus at the earliest stage from the next round of funding and making sure you have the right stories, the right people around the table, to hack that next-round algorithm in the minds of venture investors and how they make decisions, to revenues and profits.", "If you took all that energy, if you took all of that expense, if you took all of that focus, and shifted it slightly ...", "To running a business where you sell something and then make money from that sale of that thing.", "That\u2019s right. As radical as that sounds, in current dogma of the startup community that is a death sentence. If you walked into a venture fund and said that was your goal, they would have zero interest.", "They would say, \u201cI only want something that\u2019s going to go 10X; I only want something that\u2019s going to return my fund. I need to hope this is going to be a billion-dollar exit. If it\u2019s a three to five X, which would be a great return for most people, it\u2019s actually not a win for me.\u201d", "But interestingly, there\u2019s also the nuance of the venture business model, especially the early stage, where the incentives for them are actually to make sure you get more funding, too, because with each of those subsequent rounds, ideally, they\u2019re making their investment up. So, they can start ratcheting up what\u2019s called an internal rate of return, or an IRR. With that, they\u2019re able to look like geniuses and, ideally, go raise a next fund on the back of that.", "So, like you said, there\u2019s always been ... Venture capital has always been a niche way of funding a company. In the last 10 years or so, it\u2019s become pretty commonplace for people to have some idea of what that is. But most companies are not raising money through VC. I assume most of them are out there getting loans from banks. What has been the other alternative to getting VC up until now?", "I think you\u2019re right. The reality is, most ... VCs will be the first to say it, right? I would be, too. Venture capital is the wrong product for most companies. Less than 1 percent of all companies that get started raise venture capital. So, by design, it\u2019s designed to be a niche. I think our point is, even within that niche, even within the niche of people who raise venture capital, it\u2019s still working for less than 1 percent.", "So, you and I are consumers of products. If we were starting a business to sell to consumers and it worked for less than 1 percent of the people who purchased it, you would have a real problem on your hands. In parlance of venture, you would have not very good product-market fit.", "Yeah.", "And yet, because when venture works it works so spectacularly well that we\u2019ve now anchored on a handful of companies, and every entrepreneur believes and every investor believes that that\u2019s what they have to build, and that the path they follow to do that is the one they have to follow. What we are saying is, yes, that product works for a very small number of companies. If you don\u2019t fit that, even within the venture-funded startup tech landscape, we still only have one product to sell you. ", "What we stepped out and said four years ago is, let\u2019s create a space where we can talk about and think about other playbooks than the split-scaling model.", "You have a playbook. So, what is the basic offer that you\u2019re suggesting instead?", "What we are trying to do is create a community of entrepreneurs who are focused on profits and revenue early on. We\u2019re trying to curate other entrepreneurs and stories that we can help cycle through the mainstream tech press around highlighting folks who\u2019ve built businesses that VCs would love to have participated in, or who did participate later on in their lifecycle, but that wouldn\u2019t exist, likely, if they\u2019d raised a million or two million dollar seed rounds. ", "So, for instance, I live in Salt Lake City, Utah.", "Wait, Bryce, I\u2019m going to ... We\u2019re 14 minutes into it. I just want to make sure people understand what it is ...", "You\u2019ve got me rolling.", "Well, we\u2019re going to roll for a while. But I just want people to understand what it is that you\u2019re offering. I run an interesting company. I\u2019m going to sell something and make a profit on it. What can you, Bryce/Indie.vc offer me?", "So, what Indie.vc does is, we are a fund. We are investors. Technically, there\u2019s a part of our URL that says \u201cVC\u201d in it, so let\u2019s go with the idea that we\u2019re VCs. But we invest money, so we write checks between a hundred thousand and a million dollars, into startups that are post-revenue. Rather than fund you with the intent that we\u2019re going to help you raise your next round, we work closely with you to get to profitability and sustainability, and we plug you into a community of entrepreneurs, both our portfolio, in terms of our cohorts of companies, that are currently doing this, and a broader network of entrepreneurs who are at much bigger scale, that you can learn from. ", "What we\u2019ve found is probably the advice your parents gave you growing up. You become who you hang around. You lie down with the dogs, you get fleas? We\u2019re trying to create a space where they can be around others who think and build like they do.", "I\u2019m just going to force you into this real briefly. So, you\u2019re going to write me a check, a hundred thousand to a million dollars. You\u2019re not doing it as a gift.", "I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m doing it to you. ", "Probably not. You run a business, so you want that money back and you want to make a return.", "Of course.", "How does that work? If the idea is, \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to make a 10X business here, we\u2019re trying to make a real business that\u2019s going to grow at a slower rate, but it\u2019s a real business.\u201d How do you get your money out? How does that work?", "See, I think that\u2019s the misconception. I think there\u2019s two pieces of what you said that I think are misunderstood. One of those is, we\u2019re not looking for a 10X return. We believe that we can see 10X returns.", "Okay, fine.", "We\u2019re seeing some of our companies as they\u2019re growing into significance ...", "But you\u2019re not turning away companies that don\u2019t have that hockey stick.", "That\u2019s right.", "Next thing?", "But, I think the other thing that you said that I think is misunderstood is that I think people have this idea that the venture model is built on the back of 10X returns, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s actually built on the back of 1,000X returns. So, if you listen to Bill Gurley, he will say, \u201cVenture is not in the home run business, we\u2019re in the grand slam business.\u201d If you look at the percentage of grand slams that happen in any given baseball season, it\u2019s actually eerily the same number of unicorn companies that are made in a given year.", "So, I think those are the two pieces that I would argue as one. I think people are buying into a venture model that they think has a return profile, that it actually doesn\u2019t. And from our standpoint, we think we can get there, but we think that early focus on understanding the levers of your business will end up yielding similarly outsized returns.", "I know you\u2019re not evading my question, because it\u2019s a basic question.", "I know.", "How do you get your money back?", "Through returns. I mean, the same way we do. A company sells, we have ownership in that company, we get our percentage of that sale. ", "But you\u2019re not waiting for that, right? Isn\u2019t there a way for you to get a percentage of profits \u2026 ?", "There is, so there\u2019s ... We\u2019ve created a new investment instrument that functions similarly to a standard convertible note, which, in venture world, it\u2019s like a ... It\u2019s an investment instrument that anticipates either a future round of funding that we would convert into and then have an ownership stake in that business, or if you sell the business, we convert in and have a percentage of that sale go through to us. Right?", "What\u2019s unique to what we do is we have a track that, if an entrepreneur decides they ", "never", " want to raise money anymore and they want to grow their business on cash flow and they want to get rich off of profits, then we have the option of allowing them to repurchase our ownership stake through a revenue share. And so, after they\u2019ve paid us out ... After they\u2019ve repurchased our shares, the return on that investment for us, or the return on those, we cap at a 3X. ", "So, you lend me a hundred thousand dollars, eventually I pay you that back, and then your expectation is you\u2019re going to get 3X above that as a share of my revenue for some period and then it\u2019s going to stop once I\u2019ve got to 3X?", "For ", "some", " companies, right. And I think, in that case, we allow them to repurchase up to 90 percent, so we still maintain 1 percent... We have a very technical term, it\u2019s called shmuck Insurance, right? And so, we have a little bit of shmuck insurance ...", "And you hope we decide to sell this for a billion dollars after all?", "Of course, right, but in the meantime, if they end up going that more traditional route, if they decide to raise a round of financing, our return isn\u2019t capped at 3X. We convert in just like any convertible note. ", "We got it. We got there. ", "Does that make sense?", "Yeah, yeah. I got it, I just wanted to make sure you explained it clearly. ", "And one of the reasons you\u2019re talking to me, in addition to the goodness of your heart, is you\u2019re out here promoting. You want people to ... There\u2019s a program you\u2019re doing?", "That\u2019s right. ", "In March, people can sign up. ", "Yeah. Yeah, so we announced Indie.vc four years ago. Over those four years, we\u2019ve done a couple different iterations. And so, with this year\u2019s, starting January 1, we announce something we called V3, which was kind of our third iteration, new set of terms, a cohort of companies who are trying to batch our investments together. Applications are due March 1st.", "Go to ...", "Indie.vc", ".", "Indie.vc, there\u2019s a burning unicorn. ", "There should be, yeah. ", "It\u2019s pretty scary there. I looked at it yesterday. ", "It\u2019s terrifying. ", "Let me do the Devil\u2019s Advocate portion of the podcast. ", "Please. You do that well. ", "Hey, you know what? VC is great. It inspires people to grow fast. Fast growth is a good thing. There\u2019s nothing wrong with running a mom-and-pop business, but we ", "do", " want people to be ambitious. ", "And by the way, even when people don\u2019t hit grand slams, they still can have very successful businesses. Even if you only have a 2X exit or a 3X exit, that\u2019s good for the entrepreneur ... can often be good for the entrepreneur. If that\u2019s not good for the VC, well, that\u2019s the VC\u2019s problem. Everyone\u2019s a grownup. Theoretically, everyone has their eyes open. What\u2019s wrong with playing that game?", "You\u2019re stepping right into my briar patch.", "Oh, man. ", "Which is like, you have bought into the same narrative that everybody else has, which is that there\u2019s only one way to grow fast. ", "Uh-huh. ", "So, our Indie.vc companies on average are growing 100 percent in the first year and 300 percent after the second year of working with us. I wouldn\u2019t say that\u2019s terribly slow growth. It\u2019s not 10Xing every year, but it\u2019s healthy growth. I think we\u2019re seeing companies ... We\u2019ll probably get into some of them, but we\u2019re seeing companies that started working with us doing tens of thousands a month in revenue. They\u2019re now doing millions a month in revenue. ", "And so, I think that was part of the original experience, was to push back on that kind of conventional wisdom of startups, that the only way to grow fast and the only way to reflect your ambition is to jump into this funding cycle that somehow signals that you are on a path that only a world changer can be on. What we\u2019re trying to say is, \u201cThere\u2019s other ways to do it.\u201d ", "But again ...", "And what we\u2019re trying to do ... ", "But there\u2019s a way where you jump in there, but there\u2019s ways for you to jump out, I mean, especially if you\u2019re savvy about how much money you take on. ", "Sure, yeah. ", "That gives you optionality, as people in your old business and bankers say. ", "We say it. What we say is, \u201cWe\u2019re hard coding that optionality.\u201d The hard part is, today, you ", "think", " you have it but you don\u2019t know what you signed up for. When you raise...", "The ", "Gimlet guys just sold", " their company for $230 million. ", "I saw that. Awesome. ", "Eventually that price will be official, but that\u2019s the price. ", "Who broke that story, by the way?", "I broke that story, and I\u2019ve talked to some ... And there was a lot of like ... In the podcasting world, people don\u2019t spend a lot of time thinking about money. They think, \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of money,\u201d and I\u2019ve been saying to them sort of off-mic, \u201cThe VCs won\u2019t say this, but some of them aren\u2019t going to be super psyched about that,\u201d because, I think, if you invested in the last round, you\u2019ve got a three-and-a-half X return. You can argue that over 19 months, that\u2019s good, whatever, but it\u2019s still not a huge number. Right? If the VCs were truly excited about it, Gimlet maybe wouldn\u2019t have sold. But that\u2019s still a good outcome for the Gimlet guys. ", "And so, if you\u2019re a VC, you might be in ... If you were an investor in that, you might be disappointed that you didn\u2019t get 10X or a 1,000X, but no harm, no foul, right? Everyone\u2019s happy. Seems like a good outcome. ", "I would argue that they were in a position at each step of the way to optimize for that kind of outcome, right? One thing that they didn\u2019t do that was probably not so obvious to people who weren\u2019t paying attention, was they didn\u2019t bring in a traditional VC on their last round of funding. Who they brought in were strategics, and they brought in more of a group that\u2019s like a private equity partner. ", "You\u2019re saying it\u2019s no accident they didn\u2019t have a traditional VC?", "That\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m saying, which is his early-stage investors, the Betaworks, the Lowercase, they\u2019re designed, their funds are designed to see a return sub 300, 250. And that returns maybe all of their fund, but likely a material portion of their fund.

Alex and I know each other, this is something we talked a lot about when he was ...", "This is Alex Blumberg. ", "Yeah, Alex Blumberg and I talked a lot about when he was looking at his funding options, because he was someone who was at least far enough up the learning curve to know what going on with a Sand Hill Road firm, or nowadays a South Park firm ... what that meant to his cap table and what it meant to his optionality. ", "And so, yes, it wasn\u2019t a billion-dollar outcome, but I\u2019ll tell you what, because of the way they structured it, all of those investors are likely happy. They were able to have a life-changing outcome that, had they gone the conventional route, they probably would have had to fight tooth and nail to make happy. ", "I have written stories about it, or I know entrepreneurs have sold their company, they\u2019ve made a bunch of money, they\u2019ve made a life-changing amount of money. The VCs who backed them complain about it, loudly enough that I hear about it. I think, \u201cBoy, something\u2019s screwed up there.\u201d", "Right. ", "I\u2019m making your case for you. ", "Thank you. This is turning into an infomercial. ", "Here\u2019s the media critique we\u2019ve heard the last few months. Vice, BuzzFeed, this company, have all had layoffs of some sort, we\u2019re all VC-backed, to varying degrees. You could argue that maybe less VC than more strategic, whatever. ", "Sure. ", "The popular narrative is, \u201cThose greedy VCs demand to get their money back, or they want bigger returns, and thus, they\u2019ve had to have cuts.\u201d I should actually get around to writing this, but that\u2019s not true. Right? They definitely wanted big returns, but they\u2019re not trying to get BuzzFeed to cut their budget by X amount because they want to squeeze out more. ", "What\u2019s happening is BuzzFeed and Vice, and probably Vox Media, aren\u2019t able to raise any more money, certainly not at valuations they\u2019d like to see. And so, they\u2019ve got to actually run a company, but it\u2019s not because the greedy VCs are making them do it. What probably has happened, realistically, is the people who were funding them have no longer any interest in funding them, which is a nuanced thing, but it\u2019s different. ", "Again, that seems not terrible. I think that the discussion to have is, \u201cShould they ever have taken that hyper growth and all that investment to begin with?\u201d", "Yeah, I think that\u2019s a great question. I hope that more people are ...", "Maybe I\u2019ll have Jim Bankoff on, we\u2019ll talk about it. ", "I think that\u2019d be a really interesting one to riff on. I think too few people are dissecting it, because they\u2019re ... You can appreciate, there\u2019s two side to each of that, right? There\u2019s the model of the investor that says, \u201cWe want to invest. We want to invest a lot, and we want to invest only in the biggest and baddest companies.\u201d Right? ", "But then you also have the entrepreneur, who says, \u201cWell, I only want to build the biggest and baddest company. If we\u2019re in this together, we\u2019re aligned on building the biggest and baddest company, then let\u2019s start sprinting right now.\u201d Right? ", "And so, when the money\u2019s easy, it\u2019s easy to sprint. When it\u2019s hard to raise \u2014 which we can get into that a little bit too, of how the investment climate is shifting \u2014 they have to figure out how to run a real business. In the interim, they just have to get as big as they can as fast as they can. That\u2019s true in media, but I think it\u2019s also true across all of our startups.", "Yeah, but the anomaly was that media ever attracted a lot of funding. For a long time, traditional investors wanted nothing to do with it because you couldn\u2019t tell a story about this thing growing 10X. It was anomalous. People tied it to Facebook, and all of a sudden BuzzFeed was a tech company and Vox Media was a tech company. That was, I think, the way you justified getting a VC to invest in you. Traditionally, they wouldn\u2019t invest in media at all. ", "I think that\u2019s hard, right? I do think there, because we don\u2019t have any other models to fund high-growth startups, what ends up happening is everybody kind of shoehorns themself into what it is VCs think they\u2019re looking for. You get a media company that\u2019s a great content business, but you know what you hear? It\u2019s likely the podcasting companies are hearing this now, because I\u2019m almost certain all of these, BuzzFeed and Vox, has heard it too, which was, \u201cWe don\u2019t do content companies. They\u2019re not scalable.\u201d Right?", "Yeah. ", "So, what do you do rather than say, \u201cOkay, well, we\u2019re not a fit for venture. Well, if we\u2019re not a fit for venture, who are we a fit for? What does that signal if we can\u2019t raise it?\u201d Instead, you start to kind of contort yourself and you start to say, \u201cWell, maybe we\u2019re a content management company, and maybe we build this really clever CMS that allows us to spin up lots of verticals. Maybe there are ways that we can license that.\u201d", "And so, you end up kind of doing unnatural things. I think, ultimately, it\u2019s the lesson that media companies have learned over and over again is there\u2019s kind of a natural state that there\u2019s investor appetite to a point. I think what shifted recently was that the appetite for acquisitions, or the likely acquirers, they\u2019ve all been buying each other and they don\u2019t have interest or cash to go buy more to add to those platforms. ", "Yeah, that story, like the guys ... NBC put $200 million into Vox, where I work, hello, $400 million into BuzzFeed. They bought $500 million worth of Snapchat. ", "At the time, they were really proud of this, they put out a press release announcing how much money they\u2019d invested in digital. Now, they sort of pretend that didn\u2019t happen, or what they really say is, internally, \u201cThat was a worthwhile experiment, and now we\u2019ve moved on. We\u2019re no longer interested in that kind of business.\u201d", "I think the hard part of all of that is everybody wants to point a finger, as you said. Everybody wants to say, \u201cEvil VCs.\u201d Everybody wants to say, \u201cCrazy entrepreneur got really greedy.\u201d I think you can only look at it in the context of the market that they were in, right? Does Jonah Peretti at BuzzFeed really believe that he was going to be bigger than the New York Times? I have no doubt in my mind he believed that, and so wanted to surround himself with partners who believe the same thing. ", "I think the difference comes in the fact that there still remains laws of gravity, right? There\u2019s still physics that apply to business and the world. Sometimes you\u2019re able to defy those, but when you stop defying those, you have to come back to reality. When I read his post about the layoffs they did a couple of weeks ago, I was really heartened to see ... When the funny math wears off and when the easy money\u2019s gone, people have to build real businesses. The hard part now that he has, that we\u2019re trying to solve for with the work we\u2019re doing, is it\u2019s much easier to do that when you\u2019ve already built up the institutional muscle memory around that. It\u2019s much easier to scale from that than it is to retract from hyper scale into a real business and a real profitable business. ", "Do you have people coming to you who said, \u201cI have this great idea for a company. I thought the VCs would want it, they don\u2019t. Can you help me out?\u201d But they\u2019re in the paper napkin idea stage. ", "We have, yeah. No, we definitely do ...", "Do you say, \u201cGo away,\u201d or ...?", "I think we\u2019ve made a conscious decision to work with companies who are post-revenue.

What we do want to see is that we aren\u2019t taking venture risk, in the fact that there\u2019s no product, there\u2019s no revenue, which is what venture\u2019s designed to support, and getting a debt return on that.

She has more followers than all of them combined. And so, incredible reach, but she was a media company. ", "She didn\u2019t even know what venture capital was when we started talking to her. She\u2019d never heard of Y Combinator or any of this startup ecosystem stuff. She was doing less than 10K, she had less than 500,000 followers. Now, this last year, she did millions in revenue and millions in profit. ", "Does not have VC backing. ", "Does not have VC backing.

She turned down two term sheets this last year from really strong, reputable funds. We don\u2019t know, we might yet see what that looks like. ", "I mean, I do think that, given my experience with venture, what that likely would have meant is that she would have built out a big newsroom, she would have built out ... She would have started to look and act like a mainstream media company, when the magic in what\u2019s she doing is that it makes a lot of people uncomfortable and she\u2019s doing things that people who haven\u2019t locked into some predefined scale model have to do to be appealing to the outside world.", "Angie is a woman, she\u2019s an African-American, woman of color. Is it an accident that your model appeals to her? Is there something about what you\u2019re doing that is more appealing to people who don\u2019t look like Mark Zuckerberg or didn\u2019t put a year in at Harvard or Stanford?", "Yeah. I mean, I think that\u2019s one of the interesting aspects of what we\u2019ve been trying to do that may get lost on people in the mainstream tech world, right? So stepping back and looking at the numbers of venture capital and where the dollars are getting allocated and we often joke that unicorns ate seed investing because what unicorns reward is pattern-matching. ", "And so, when you look for something that looks like it can be a billion dollars, no one gets fired for funding a kid who dropped out of Harvard, who dropped out of Stanford, and so what you get is, over the last few years, it\u2019s become more and more understood that the archetypes of investing are 98 percent of venture dollars go to men, 80 percent of venture dollars go to three states, less than 1 percent of venture dollars go to people of color. ", "And so here\u2019s a woman ... so, she\u2019s in the tiniest of Venn diagrams.", "So how does that work for your portfolio? What does your portfolio look like, roughly?", "Yeah, I mean, we\u2019re 50-50. So we\u2019re half male founder, half female founder.", "So right away you\u2019re anomalous.", "We\u2019re anomalous. We have 20 percent of our founders are black founders. And I think what\u2019s been interesting is we\u2019ve been able to give people who wouldn\u2019t have had, traditionally, venture support, we\u2019ve been able to give them investment and a network that they might not have been able to plug into otherwise.", "And what we\u2019re seeing, particularly in the case of Angie, who was going from barely hanging on to throwing off cash. And I don\u2019t think we can take much credit for that, but she would probably give us more credit than we deserve around what her involvement with us has meant to her business. And so when I look at why we might appeal, it\u2019s that the best position someone who doesn\u2019t raise or hasn\u2019t historically raised venture capital in the past \u2014 women, people of color, underrepresented people \u2014 the most appealing you can be to investors is being in a position to say no. And we\u2019re seeing that play out ...", "Like most things in life, right?", "Of course! But we\u2019re seeing that play out every single day in our portfolio, whether they\u2019re underrepresented or whether they\u2019re mainstream entrepreneurs who maybe have raised venture before, but didn\u2019t want to go back down that track again right up front, is that the more we can put them in a position to say no, the more enthusiasm there is from investors to get them to say yes.", "Are there media companies you\u2019ve invested in? Obviously, you do a range of stuff.", "I don\u2019t think so.", "Okay, Shade Room\u2019s your anomalous...", "Anomalous media company. I mean, and we\u2019re in the middle of our application process right now so I hope we\u2019ll see more of them, because I think there are ... if you look at the winds of change that are happening in the media company, you\u2019re probably paying attention to Ben Thompson. You\u2019re paying attention to independent writers kinda spinning up their own ...", "There\u2019s that, there\u2019s all the subscription services.", "All the subscription services now, most of those don\u2019t look like what you\u2019d historically consider venture scale. But, put on the right path and given the right set of resources, there might be some of those that end up looking more like platforms over time as they evolve.

And I talked to a VC there who is confidently explaining to me that they wouldn\u2019t do media unless it\u2019s attached to a piece of hardware, because now everyone wants to do Peloton. And leaving aside the merits of Peloton, I think it\u2019s just hilarious that that\u2019s now the new model, is sell an expensive piece of hardware and then get someone to pay 30 bucks, because maybe it\u2019ll work for Peloton but there\u2019s not gonna be 100 of \u2018em, or 10 of \u2018em.", "Yep. No, or interested in a media company but only if it has its own physical products that it\u2019s selling and it\u2019s ... you know, it\u2019s like a merchandising, it\u2019s basically a catalog of some sort for a lifestyle that they want to ... yeah. ", "The winds of change are always shifting, right? And so if you were raising money for VR two years ago, it might have been easy. It\u2019s much, much harder to get anybody to even take a meeting these days. And so I think one of the things that that informs around how we invest is, if you\u2019re in a category that\u2019s directionally correct but it\u2019s out of favor, that\u2019s a pretty interesting place to be. If we can help put you on a path to not needing investors when sentiment for your category starts to heat up again, you\u2019ll be in a position to pick and choose who you wanna work with or whether you want to work with anybody.", "Speaking of other VCs, you mentioned this off-air that someone\u2019s come up to you in your face and said, \u201cWhat\u2019re you doing here?\u201d That\u2019s half-bullshit, right?

And I had a quote in there that said I was surprised at how thin-skinned my peers in venture would be when someone starts to poke at the model a little bit. Partly because these are the conversations we have in coffee shops and in conference rooms all the time because everybody\u2019s questioning why this isn\u2019t working at the scale that it should be working and they\u2019re questioning whether or not this is the right model to be funding every company that comes through the door.", "But I think the other part of that is that, you mentioned it, I actually have ... there are people who don\u2019t reply to my emails anymore and there are people who\u2019ve confronted me at different events who don\u2019t like what it is that I\u2019ve been saying.", "Because to be clear, right, you have a nice resonant voice and you\u2019re tall, but you\u2019re not out there with a pitchfork threatening to burn down the ...", "No, and I mean ... but I think that\u2019s the thing that seems to be lost on people, right?

That we aren\u2019t critiquing venture, that we\u2019re saying venture works for some companies. It works really well for some of those companies and there\u2019s a reason it does.

But you know, in seven years, for someone to be heads-down on a business ... and so I became in her story, I think ... I don\u2019t know how many VCs there are named Bryce or what, but I became the masthead for a VC who\u2019s gonna ask kinda hard questions that maybe she was having a hard time answering. ", "And when you work with an investor, if those questions make you uncomfortable, then I think more entrepreneurs should be asking themselves not whether they are a fit for venture capital, which is clearly the question she was coming to me to ask, but more so, is venture capital right for me? And I think the default today is I need to be asking myself if I\u2019m a fit for venture. And then I have to make myself look like I\u2019m a fit for venture instead of really being thoughtful about like, \u201cIs venture right for me? Because it doesn\u2019t feel right.\u201d", "She clearly wasn\u2019t gonna be someone who wanted to do venture. I think the fundamental question for her \u2014 and I think that\u2019s a really candid post. I mean, she\u2019s essentially saying she didn\u2019t want to run this business that is 100 percent attached to her and her persona and her name, and she wanted it to be in good hands but she didn\u2019t want to run it full-time. And I think any investor, whether it\u2019s you or a VC or a bank, would say, \u201cA person who\u2019s built around it doesn\u2019t want to do it, then we need to figure ...\u201d And also that limits what she can do with the sale and I think that\u2019s why it shut down.", "And remember, when that post came out it got lumped in with whatever round of media layoffs we were having, but that\u2019s a different thing. That\u2019s a company attached to a person who doesn\u2019t want to do that company anymore. And you can\u2019t solve that with a funding model.", "That\u2019s right, you can\u2019t solve that with a funding model. But what I appreciate about what she did and what I feel like we\u2019re missing out on in this kind of rush to fit into the traditional venture model, is I feel like we\u2019re missing out on companies and company cultures that could be really special. That could be even experimental and go on to be massive, but because as an entrepreneur, now we\u2019re conditioning them to think, \u201cWell, I\u2019m not even gonna start if it\u2019s not clearly a billion-dollar idea.\u201d I think we\u2019re missing out on really special kinds of companies, really special entrepreneurs who look at that model and say, \u201cThat\u2019s not me, but if it\u2019s not me, I got nowhere to go.\u201d", "And a lot of what makes especially these bootstrapped companies that I\u2019ve gotten to know over the years, almost to the one, the companies that are most interesting and scale the largest, I will universally tell them, everything you\u2019ve done to make your business work and to stand apart and to make it special are things that if I were your board member, I would\u2019ve had to drop the hammer on. You can\u2019t do those things because that doesn\u2019t fit what the next set of investors is going to look for.

", "And prior to all this, you were at Time Inc running a bunch of their brands\u2026", "15 years.", "\u2026 rising star, went to run Ziff Davis. You can Google Ziff Davis, at one point a giant magazine publisher, eventually bankrupt, out of bankruptcy, is now a publisher of a smaller portfolio of assets that you own. ", "Yes. ", "I think of you as a guy who for the last three, four, five years, pretty much to anyone who would ask would say, \u201cMost of you guys are doing it wrong, most of the media businesses is going in the wrong direction. You\u2019re raising too much money, you\u2019re pursuing this advertising-based/Facebook/Google-based strategy. It\u2019s not gonna work.\u201d You can do a victory lap now if you want, \u2018cause it kind of sounds like you had it right all along. ", "I mean, look, I think from a digital media point of view, we understand pretty early on that display-only \u2014 and by display I mean ad banners and pre-roll ads \u2014 alone wasn\u2019t going to work. Right? So recognizing that we needed multiple revenue streams, which when you go back to my Time Inc days, when you go back to your magazine days, we\u2019ve always had multiple revenue streams. ", "Consumer pays for a subscription, there\u2019s advertising, there\u2019s other stuff. ", "Exactly. So we understood that, right, and so when you look at what we\u2019ve done on the media side, more than half of our revenues are not display advertising. So it\u2019s either performance marketing, which we can talk more about, but it\u2019s basically driving transactions and driving leads. So yes, a form of advertising, but different. Not RFP-based, not request-for-proposal-based, not ad-served-based, but really driving transactions. ", "You\u2019re not getting paid for showing someone an ad, you\u2019re getting paid when someone does something. ", "We do. So, to be clear, we do have a display advertising business, and it\u2019s a substantial one. It\u2019s $250 million a year. But we have north of that in performance marketing and subscriptions. ", "So, back to your original point, yes, I think we saw that display-only wouldn\u2019t work. I think the other thing that probably distinguishes us from some, not all, digital media companies is we are very earnings and cash-flow focused. So we run the business in sort of a really traditional way, right? It just happens to be a digital media business, but from our point of view, we\u2019re here to generate cash. ", "Is that just simply a function that you\u2019re publicly traded and you have to show that? ", "No, I think it\u2019s our mindset. And I think, you know, going back to my Time Inc days, what maybe not everyone associates with Time Inc, but I do, a very disciplined company. It ran a very sound business. So the 15 years I spent there really trained me to run a media business like a business. ", "Right. And it was in decline for a lot of that time and it had the same internet problem that everyone else had. But you guys were making money year after year after year. And all the folks that were there, I\u2019m assuming that includes you, said, \u201cMan, the problem is that we had to take all our profits and hand them over to Time Warner, and we could never do anything else.\u201d ", "Yeah. Look, so I think the one thing that if we could\u2019ve done differently, I think, is to take the cash that we were generating from our operations and invest it back into the business, either in the form of investments in the business, operating investments, more capital investments, or acquisitions. And so I won\u2019t go through the acquisitions that ...", "The could\u2019ve, would\u2019ve, should\u2019ve.", "Well, we had a list that if we had transacted on any of those, I think, would\u2019ve fundamentally changed that company. ", "And so when I moved into Ziff Davis, so I spent 15 years at Time Inc, when I moved into Ziff Davis, just understand what Ziff Davis was. Ziff Davis had just come out of bankruptcy, had one brand, that was PC mag, doing $16 million of revenue, losing some millions that we acquired for about $22.5 million. So I didn\u2019t start with necessarily the most success.", "Successful portfolio.", "Yes. But what we understood was that there was a path for that brand, that if we could take the cash we were gonna generate from that brand and acquire other brands, which we started to do, that we could start to build something interesting. And really, it\u2019s from that early kernel, which was 2010 to today, we have a $600 million media business. ", "So we understood the role that acquisitions could play in building a modern digital media company, too. So that\u2019s an important part in, I think, the distinction. ", "So let\u2019s explain what performance marketing is. I think broadly this is what people call e-commerce now. ", "It\u2019s a combination of ...", "At least when they\u2019re talking about media companies.", "Yeah. So it\u2019s a combination, for us, it\u2019s affiliate e-commerce. So links on articles that drive your users to a commerce site to transact. ", "And you get paid either when you send someone, when someone clicks on the link, or when they go there and then maybe buy or in some way transact on the other side. ", "Correct. So turning consumers of content into consumers of products and services, it\u2019s something that I think a lot of businesses now are doing.", "The last couple years, a lot of ... Vox Media has a little group dedicated to this. BuzzFeed does, the New York Times went out and bought Wirecutter, and that is the core of that business, is you go ask them, \u201cWhat kind of refrigerator should I buy?\u201d They tell you, \u201cGo buy this one,\u201d and you end up at Best Buy and maybe Wirecutter gets a cut of that deal. ", "So we saw that eight years ago, and that\u2019s a $250 million a year business for us. And think about the margin profile, that\u2019s very high, right? Because I\u2019ve already spent my cost on editorial, infrastructure, etc. It also is different than your traditional ad business, where someone says, \u201cI\u2019m gonna buy a certain amount,\u201d and then you fulfill it. Here, it\u2019s uncapped. \u201cAs long as you drive a transaction, I\u2019ll pay you.\u201d And we love that characteristic for the business. ", "So yes, it\u2019s more competitive, more people are focused on it, but I think that\u2019s a positive. Because I\u2019ll tell you, when we started in affiliate commerce, most affiliate publishers weren\u2019t the highest-quality editorial publishers. Now you look at the affiliate commerce industry and you\u2019ve got a number ...", "New York Times on down, right?", "Yeah. You\u2019ve got New York Times, you\u2019ve got the properties inside of this building at Vox, you\u2019ve got quality properties. ", "New York magazine is really pushing this. ", "Yeah. So, that\u2019s good. So, that is performance marketing. ", "Another element that we have that some of these companies also have, or may not have, is lead gen. Where there is certain products and services, particularly in the enterprise where you\u2019re not gonna transact online. Where we\u2019re helping collect lead forms that turn into something a salesperson can follow up on. ", "Again, and a very old model and it\u2019s been around as long as the internet\u2019s been around.", "A great B2B model. ", "Right. ", "Yeah. ", "And sort of waxes and wanes, I think, depending on sort of like, there\u2019s a lot of credit card stuff and mortgage stuff that comes back and forth. But for things, high considerations products, right?", "Correct. ", "That\u2019s the correct term for it. Where someone, if they loop you in as a customer, they\u2019re gonna make an enormous amount of money so they can pay you a significant chunk of money for that lead. ", "That\u2019s right. Their allowable is high. ", "So given that that\u2019s the core of your business, or the main thrust of your business, when you\u2019re looking at things you want to buy or maybe even build, I\u2019m assuming that that means that anything you\u2019re looking at has to work in that model?", "So, again, not everything. So let\u2019s go the J2 portfolio for a second. I think if you are ... affiliate commerce and performance marketing is one play in our playbook, subscriptions is another play. But let\u2019s focus on performance marketing since we\u2019re talking about it and we can get into subscriptions. ", "Take Mashable. We had looked to acquire Mashable some years ago. I love the brand, I reached out to Pete Cashmore, the founder, great guy. ", "This, too, was just last year?", "So we bought it last year. ", "2018?", "Yeah. But some years ago, I had approached the company about buying. And Pete, at the time, chose to raise capital, and he did. And he raised a fair amount of capital. ", "And this is a property, just to go way back, that started off as a MySpace enthusiast blog that Pete started when he was like 12 or something. And he\u2019s telling you like how to mod your MySpace page, then became this like fantastically sort of successful, nerdy, tech-specific site. And then over time, intentionally tried to get much bigger and much broader. ", "And that was the challenge, right? I think when we were having our original conversations, and it was a tech- and digital-oriented publisher, it was a profitable business, it was a great business. I think once they raised capital, it changed their ambition. And so they went beyond that focus editorially, but more importantly, they went into a studio business, and they went into a business called Velocity, which was a software business. And I think ...", "So studio business meaning ...", "Video content.", "\u201cWe\u2019re gonna make stuff.\u201d", "Yes. For social platforms, for the checkbooks that have been out to buy content. ", "\u201cMaybe Netflix will buy a show from us.\u201d ", "Correct. And so, look, I think what ended up happening, it went from a money-making business to a money-losing business. And then over time, all of those losses ate into the venture cash that was on the balance sheet and they ran out of money. And so we look at it and say, \u201cOkay, but wait a minute. If you go back in time and if you reverse those decisions, there was a good, nice, core profitable business.\u201d And inside of our portfolio, that\u2019s fantastic. ", "So when you\u2019re looking at a Mashable, you say, \u201cAll right, it\u2019s a business with however many pageviews.\u201d Are you interested in the entirety of the business or do you go, \u201cAll we care about is a specific part of that business because that\u2019s what we can attach affiliate ads to\u201d? ", "Well, in that case, before you even got into adding affiliate revenue to it, was there a profitable core? And the answer is, yes. I mean, there was a profitable business that was inside of an unprofitable company. And so if you can reverse the decisions that made it unprofitable and get back to the profitable core, you\u2019re already in a good place. And so that\u2019s what we did. ", "Now, you layer in a new revenue stream, in this case affiliate commerce, and you\u2019re in a great position. So fast-forward a year now, I think when we acquired Mashable their annual losses were in excess of $16 million a year. They are now a solidly profitable, probably mid-single-digit millions business for us. ", "I\u2019m assuming you had to shrink that staff in order to get to that number? ", "Yeah. You look for \u2026 When I talk about reversing decisions, you do that one of two ways. You can try to sell pieces of the business off that you don\u2019t feel are core. In this instance, they weren\u2019t really saleable assets. Or you make the decision, they\u2019re difficult decisions but they\u2019re the right business decisions, to narrow the workforce to focus on the core business. And so, yeah, you\u2019re almost shrinking to grow the business. But the alternative is a situation like Mic, when the business goes away entirely, which would be a shame. A brand like Mashable should not have gone away, and thankfully it did not go away. ", "Did you guys look at Mic?", "We didn\u2019t. ", "No. So why look at a Mashable but not a Mic, if from a very, very 10,000-foot perspective they seem like similar... They\u2019re publishing on the internet, they\u2019re targeting younger people. ", "Two differences. One is, Mashable established a profitable business. Right? So in its history, as I said ...", "It has been profitable in the past. ", "It was profitable. And then decided to expand with venture money into areas that made it unprofitable. ", "And you can reverse that?", "Yes. So that\u2019s a key difference. ", "The second is if you\u2019re going to participate in affiliate commerce, you need a brand that has some authority over helping inform some buying decisions. Mashable has that. So when Mashable talks about the best VPN, or the best headphones, or the best laptops, you\u2019ll pay attention. So you need a brand that can be attached to that kind of content if you\u2019re going to be in the affiliate commerce business.", "So authority in a thing that also has affiliate commerce attached to it?", "Service journalism.", "Right.", "What we would call service journalism when we were in our magazine days.", "I want to know what kind of headphones to buy.", "Totally.", "I\u2019ll go to Google, I\u2019m going to get a list of 10 results. One might be Wirecutter, one might be Mashable, one might be The Verge. You can make money by attaching ads to those recommendations.", "Correct. Correct.", "So you also looked ... famously made a bid for Gawker Media when they were in bankruptcy.", "We were the stalking horse.", "You were the stalking horse. Didn\u2019t end up picking it up, went to Univision. That\u2019s a whole other story now. But what was the plan, had you had won that bid?", "Gizmo and Lifehacker. Two great brands.", "Tech site and sort of generalized how to get things done site.", "Yeah. So they were, I think, a perfect fit within our portfolio, within our tech media portfolio. They had already started down the affiliate commerce path with something called Kinja which was really more a commerce content management system.", "God bless you if you could explain that. Nick Denton tried for 10 years, I never understood it.", "I think it was just basically technology to inform affiliated commerce.", "Okay.", "They went down a path we understood. We thought we could accelerate that path, and so we were optimistic about our abilities with those properties. I think the rest of the properties were less of a fit for us, and we would have thought of ways possibly to figure alternatives out for those. But we were motivated ...", "Maybe sell them off or ...", "Ah, maybe, yeah. Yeah. And we\u2019ve done that. We sold three businesses last year at J2, so we\u2019re not averse to that, it\u2019s got to fit within the portfolio. But we really liked those two brands and we liked the price that we were in at. I think if I\u2019m not mistaken, we were at $90 million at that time.", "So it is, you would have bought the entire portfolio, I think minus gawker.com, and you would\u2019ve been very interested in two of those properties and figured out what to do with the rest of them.", "People forget this, but Gizmodo was the original property.", "For Gawker?", "Yeah.", "Yeah, yeah, yeah.", "Gawker came ", "after", " Gizmodo.", "Right. When you buy an asset like a Mashable, or when you look at buying an asset like a Gawker Media, and they have a different culture than the J2/Ziff Davis culture, how do you think about how you\u2019re going to figure out that transition and how you\u2019re going to keep the people you want to keep from the company you\u2019re buying?", "Look, I think it comes down to people want to be a position where they can succeed, where they can win, where we can invest, where we can be on offense, we can acquire. I think that\u2019s one of the things that\u2019s been very compelling to a lot of the people we\u2019ve acquired into the company and have stayed with us is they\u2019re able to leverage our balance sheet, our cash, to go and do more and build larger businesses.", "So that sounds very rational, right? But when you\u2019re talking, especially when you\u2019re talking about media, right, a lot of us are delicate flowers. And we think that our work is very important and advocates of the First Amendment, etc., and you go to somewhere like Ziff Davis, Ziff Davis specifically: \u201cWe have a model, we are going to make money when people come to our site, they click on a link, and it\u2019s a good business, can be a very good business. It may not be sexy, it may not be interesting to someone at a cocktail party, it may not get covered in one of the umpteen media blogs.\u201d Do you have to sort of go to people and say, \u201cThis is the new reality\u201d? Or can you soften that blow for them?", "Yeah, but I don\u2019t think, and I\u2019m not asking them to think entirely about J2, I\u2019m asking them to think about their brands. So if you work at IGN \u2026 we acquired IGN, it was not a successful business, it had been a successful business and we returned it to its prior glory. So everyone who works at IGN feels like, \u201cI work at a great brand.\u201d ", "We did the same with PCMag. PCMag was bankrupt. Now the team there \u2014 and a lot of those folks had been there for a while \u2014 feel fantastic because they\u2019re part of a winning brand. I think the same is happening now at Mashable, where you\u2019ve got members of the team who feel really good about the fact that this is a successful, profitable business that isn\u2019t going anywhere.", "It\u2019s very hard to imagine this one working with the Gawker folks, especially when you see sort of what happened at Univision where they were theoretically more aligned. You know, cut to a year later, the folks at Gawker/Gizmodo are writing really savage pieces about how inept their owners are.", "Yeah.", "I can\u2019t image that culture working with your culture.", "Yeah, look. I think that if they perform and deliver results, we\u2019re satisfied. I mean, you know me enough that, you know we\u2019re not trying to impose some overarching corporate will. One of the things that I think we\u2019ve done really well at J2 is let each of the brands determine their own paths with certain understanding around requirements, around results, etc. And there\u2019s discipline, but in the end there\u2019s a self-determination that goes on.", "You do your job, and then after you\u2019ve done your job, or as long as you\u2019ve done your job, you can fly your freak flag.", "Yeah! I think that\u2019s absolutely right. And look I know editorial cultures, right? I mean, I spent 15 years at Time Inc. and so we understand that, fundamentally, they want to be in a position to do what they\u2019re here to do. And if I can create an environment that allows these editorial folks to write, produce video, audio, whatever it is, in the way they want, they feel good about that. ", "Versus, I don\u2019t think people within our portfolio are worried about whether or not we\u2019re going to make payroll. Or whether or not we\u2019re going to be around in three months. And if you look in the digital media landscape, there\u2019re a lot of people worried about whether or not their company\u2019s going to make payroll.", "Last year was rough. Seems like this year\u2019s going to be rough. I mean, if you were \u2014 I don\u2019t think you need a genius to figure this out \u2014 if you were worried about where your money was going to come from last year, that might be even more acute this year.", "One, what does that mean for your business, the existing business you guys have? I was looking at your last Q3, it looks like you were down a little bit on the media side?", "No, no.", "Overall up for the year, but I think the Q3 was down year over year.", "No, no. No, no. We\u2019re up. Solid. ", "Did I misread it?", "Yeah, I think so.", "Top line? Correct?", "Absolutely.", "I\u2019ll blame it on my phone.", "Yeah, no, so we ... Look, fundamentally, we acquire businesses. The J2 acquisition system is core to what we do. So if we are entering into a market where we see some sort of deflation in prices, that\u2019ll be good for us.", "So just to give you an order of magnitude, over the last 10 years, we have spent $2.2 billion as a company acquiring companies. I think since our inception, which is about two decades ago, we\u2019ve acquired 170 companies. It is core to what we do. So if we\u2019re entering into an environment that is a buyer\u2019s market, that\u2019s fantastic for us.", "I\u2019m assuming that there is going to be a lot of stuff out there, I\u2019m sure a lot of stuff comes to you already?", "Mm-hmm.", "I think we kind of covered this, but just lay it out. What are the things that you most want to buy and what are the things that you want to take a pass on?", " ", "I\u2019m assuming there are some things where they\u2019re in the middle. Where like, \u201cI don\u2019t want to pay this for it, but if it\u2019s offered at basically no price, I\u2019ll take it.\u201d", "Yeah, so we have an expression we use that we sort of paraphrase from Berkshire Hathaway which is, we buy fair businesses at great prices, or great businesses at fair prices. And so what does that mean? That means that there are businesses that, you know, where the value is there, where we see an opportunity to change something to create value, whether that\u2019s the shrink to grow that we had talked about, whether that\u2019s introducing a new revenue stream. ", "And then there are businesses that are just fantastic businesses that we can throw fuel on the fire. And whether that\u2019s, we can help them with marketing, whether that\u2019s we can help them with cross-sell, whether that\u2019s we can provide capital for them to pursue their ambitions, we\u2019ll look for those businesses too. ", "And so a business like that is Ookla or Humble Bundle or offers.com. These are businesses that were fast-growing businesses when we bought them, and all we have done is make them better. Which is different than maybe some of the other properties that we were talking about where it was more of a turnaround situation. ", "So we\u2019ll look across the landscape for opportunities, and ultimately the price that we pay is a function of where that business sits.", "Like if you talk to the folks at NBC, at Comcast, who up until a couple of years ago were putting a lot of money into properties like this one, Vox Media, BuzzFeed, they bought a bunch of shares in Snap. Now what they\u2019ll say is, \u201cWe\u2019re not very interested in companies that are dependent primarily on advertising. We\u2019re not very interested in companies that are Facebook-dependent, Google-dependent.\u201d Are you in that same boat, or is there a world where some of those things make sense for you?", "Look, it\u2019s case by case, right? So I think ...", "What ", "they", " say is, \u201cWe really like commerce businesses. We like businesses where consumers pay money for something and we can partake in that.\u201d", "Yeah. Look, I think ultimately, we look at every acquisition opportunity with one central question, which is, \u201cCan we create value?\u201d And there are multiple ways in which we\u2019ve created value. So it\u2019s hard for me to sort of say anything definitively like, \u201cWe will never do this,\u201d and, \u201cWe will always do this.\u201d It\u2019s case by case. And it should be, right? And so what we\u2019re very good at is identifying, evaluating, diligencing, transacting, integrating acquisitions where we feel that we can create value such that ... it\u2019s got to be this, whereby owning the business we have made it better. That we uniquely can make it better.", "I assume there are two kinds of things coming across your desk. One is a Mic or a Mashable where, \u201cWe are out of money, we are going to have to close the door in X number of days.\u201d", "Yeah. Fair business is a great process.", "Like, \u201cIf someone doesn\u2019t buy us, we\u2019re going away.\u201d And I\u2019m assuming there\u2019s another bucket of people who say, \u201cWe have a business, we can keep operating the business. It\u2019s just not what we thought it was going to be and/or our investors want out.\u201d Are those harder to make happen because you\u2019re trying to please different constituencies versus one thing is a fire sale and a dollar is a dollar?", "No, I mean again, look, I think transacting in general has never been easy. A lot of things have to line up. We tend to be very good at it because I think we very quickly come to a point of view and can move decisively and with integrity. You know, we have a good reputation when we transact that we behave the way we say we\u2019re going to behave, so there\u2019s no re-trading, there\u2019s no sort of eleventh hour renegotiations. That\u2019s not who we are. Because transactions are core to what we do so maintaining our reputation in the M&A marketplace is critical. ", "So no, again, I think that in the third category of businesses, which really, these are great, fundamental businesses. They don\u2019t need to sell, but they recognize that if they can get access to our balance sheet, maybe they can go do something interesting. So let\u2019s talk about Ookla because we talked about it earlier.", "Speedtest.", "Speedtest.", "If you\u2019ve Googled \u201cspeed test\u201d because your internet doesn\u2019t work as fast as you think it should, maybe you even downloaded the app because you\u2019re a nerd like myself, you get that little ...", "Yep. The gauge.", "The gauge. You hit it and it tells you your internet is slow.", "Correct.", "I assumed that you made money by showing me a banner ad there. You\u2019ve told me I\u2019m wrong.", "So let\u2019s step back and talk about the size of Ookla. So Ookla has 360 million installs of its app, all organic, on various, mostly phones. So that\u2019s an extraordinary statement.", "So people like me who put it on my phone.", "Correct. So it\u2019s more than just a narrow universe of people.", "But I figured I was a really, really narrow slice of nerd-dom.", "No.", "Because most people just go \u201cMy internet doesn\u2019t work,\u201d and then they throw their phone.", "No. So, 360 million installs of the app. So when we looked at acquiring the company, you\u2019re right. It fundamentally ran programmatic ads, so ads it didn\u2019t sell, that Google placed within the websites, speedtest.net, or within the app.", "That\u2019s a business.", "That\u2019s a business. And it was growing because the usage and the traffic was growing. And we looked at it. And we came to understand it because we were working with them on some editorial content. \u201cOh, tell us the fastest ISPs, tell us the fastest mobile network.\u201d So we knew it. And I said, \u201cThat\u2019s an interesting business.\u201d ", "And so as we got to know them, we said, \u201cLook, what are you doing with all of this information that you\u2019re sitting on? This incredible view into broadband and into networks and into experiences?\u201d", "So just to be clear, right, so me being frustrated with my internet speed, either at work or at home, is somewhat, it\u2019s interesting to a point to me, but if you multiply me times 300 million people and you know what my internet, what all those internet speeds are in lots of different places, you know where they are, that becomes valuable why?", "I think the aggregated view, not the individual view, the aggregated view into the quality and performance of networks and whether that\u2019s Verizon\u2019s network or Comcast\u2019s network or Sprint\u2019s network or Vodaphone\u2019s network, that\u2019s interesting to those sellers of broadband and it allows them to understand where they\u2019re weak and where they\u2019re competitively disadvantaged.

So, Ookla, as sellers to us, liked the vision, had some concerns about investing to build the infrastructure. ", "It was a standalone company. ", "Correct. We were building a business intelligence software platform. That\u2019s not what they did. That takes capital. That\u2019s where coming into J2, we don\u2019t think twice. That is a good capital investment.

That\u2019s what it\u2019s called, the data service, and they certainly wouldn\u2019t have gone out and acquired the businesses that we\u2019ve acquired for them. And that allows them to build something really special.", "In an era where people are \u2014 particularly now, at least, the press is particularly interested in privacy, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve clicked the button that says, \u201cSure, this is okay.\u201d I\u2019m sure I also have not thought of why ... because I\u2019ve talked to you about it.

", "Well look, I think No. 1, if you see the disclosure that we have, it\u2019s very strong, it\u2019s very apparent. It\u2019s not hidden and it\u2019s very clear what we\u2019re doing.

We\u2019re providing data to make your experience better. I\u2019m not targeting ads. We get a lot of inquiries into our data for ad targeting, for location data. We don\u2019t do that. We don\u2019t sell that. So our data business is not what you hear about with a lot of other companies, where they\u2019re essentially selling your information so that someone can target an ad against you. That\u2019s not what we\u2019re doing. ", "Are there other Ooklas out there? So that\u2019s the only one you\u2019re going to buy in that category, but things where you can take, it may be consumer behavior, and figure out a different way of monetizing it than you\u2019ve traditionally done. ", "It\u2019s a great question.", "Thank you! ", "It is. When we start to think about the different models we like, how do you find properties on the internet that have an engaged audience where the exhaust of what they do is a body of information that a company would find very valuable. Not for ad targeting, but to run their business. ", "The exhaust meaning the data that\u2019s sort of kicked up in the transaction. ", "Yes. And that\u2019s an interesting perspective, right? Fundamentally, we have audiences. We\u2019re trying to extract rent from these audiences. Historically, the main rent was an ad, but there are possible ...", "Attention, right? You give me your attention, I put an ad in front of it. That\u2019s the transaction and you get that whether you\u2019ve thought it through or whether it\u2019s just the way you\u2019ve always looked at stuff. ", "That\u2019s right. But can that audience, by virtue of what they\u2019re doing, inform business intelligence? That\u2019s one product. And then the other piece of this \u2014 which is a good segue to our Humble Bundle transaction \u2014 is can we sell a subscription service to our audiences that is not \u201cput a paywall in front of the thing you were getting for free?\u201d", "I\u2019ve never heard of Humble Bundle until I was looking at your Q3 this morning, which apparently I misread anyway. Tell me what it is. ", "It is a fantastic business. So it is a subscription service where you get access to a trove of games, video games, and every month we give you a handful of new games. And so you pay this one fee, think of it almost like a subscription video on-demand, but for gaming. ", "There was, GameFly was a version of this. There\u2019s been subscription gaming services before. ", "There have been, but this one is done pretty well. And I think the reason it\u2019s done pretty well is that they\u2019ve got a great perspective on which games to include each month. We also finance our own games. So we have proprietary games that are Humble games that come into our service. ", "So it\u2019s a little bit like when you start to think of like a Netflix, you start with licensed content and then you start to move into original content. We\u2019ve sort of done a very similar thing. But the important thing is, it\u2019s a great business on its own. They\u2019ve done a fantastic job, but we have IGN, which has the largest audience of gamers worldwide. ", "So instead of saying, as many publishers have done, \u201cHow do we charge our users for something they\u2019re already getting?\u201d which is the content at IGN, we\u2019re not doing that. We\u2019re saying, \u201cHow do we leverage this audience?\u201d", "This is, a lot of folks come in here saying, \u201cWe\u2019re putting up a paywall.\u201d ", "Yes. ", "Or \u201cwe\u2019re not going to call it a paywall, we\u2019re going to call it an affinity group, and we\u2019re going to give you extra stuff if you pay us.\u201d", "No. What we\u2019re saying is we have this service over here and we\u2019re going to market it. So when you look at most subscription businesses, the No. 1 expense is marketing. Acquiring subscribers. That is the No. 1 expense you will see in most subscription businesses. ", "And you\u2019re doing the math, \u201cHow much am I paying to acquire this customer?\u201d versus \u201cHow long are they going to stick around?\u201d", "Cost to acquire a customer versus the lifetime value, right?", "Yep.", "Right, that is the CAC versus LTV equation, is the formula of subscription businesses. What happens when your CAC goes down, though, because you\u2019re an owner of audiences? And that\u2019s our other epiphany. So when we think about our media businesses, we think about what subscription services can we build or acquire that are of interest to our markets and to our audiences so that we can have a really attractive CAC-LTV equation? ", "So that is different. When a lot of media companies talk about, \u201cWe\u2019re going for subscriptions,\u201d they\u2019re really talking about trying to get their users to pay for something that has historically been free. ", "Tough. ", "That\u2019s hard. ", "Yeah. Getting paid for something that was free a month ago. ", "Correct. ", "On this very site. It\u2019s not just information, it\u2019s the information you used to get for free, we\u2019re now going to charge you. Please pay. ", "That\u2019s hard. But doing what we\u2019re doing with IGN and Humble Bundle is attractive. So that is another model where we think about what other subscription services are out there, that somebody else has invented, that when plugged into our reach ...", "Someone would normally have to pay IGN to advertise that business. ", "Correct. ", "You guys own the business, you\u2019re saving money.", "Precisely. ", "I just want to go back to a thing we talked about at the beginning of this conversation. We had David Carey here a year ago, he was running Hearst at the time, saying, \u201cAll these digital media businesses ... It\u2019s easy to lose money in a digital media business. And I\u2019m going to buy you and all your Aeron chairs, collectively.\u201d He\u2019s partially right. Do you think that rate of failure/consolidation is going to accelerate this year? ", "Let me start by saying I don\u2019t want anyone to fail, so we don\u2019t root for people to fail.", "That said... ", "Look, I think that fundamentally, I\u2019d much prefer to be buying healthy businesses at better value. ", "You don\u2019t want to be known as a distressed asset buyer? ", "I just want to be viewed as a creator of value in the acquisitions that we do. We want to create value, okay? And we want to create value that is in excess of what anyone else could do with the asset. I can tell you that, in the end, when you can get a fundamentally healthy business at an attractive price, that\u2019s the most optimal equation, so that\u2019s what we\u2019d rather have.", "So are you rubbing your hands together saying, \u201cAll right, this is the time to buy\u201d?", "Again, we buy all the time. So from my point of view, every market, up market, down market, flat market, we\u2019re acquirers. Again, if you look at J2\u2019s history, if you look at the digital media portion of J2, the non-digital media portion of J2, we transact. That\u2019s what we do. ", "So whether the market is a good market or a bad market, we\u2019re going to find opportunities. That\u2019s what we\u2019re good at. So I don\u2019t sit here and think too much about things I\u2019m not going to be able to control, which is the marketplace. In the end, again, I\u2019m simply saying my preference is I\u2019d rather have quality businesses that we can get at reasonable prices. ", "What\u2019s life like for you running a public company that, again, most people \u2014 and I think this includes Wall Street \u2013 haven\u2019t heard of? At Time Inc you were a rising star, I probably heard/saw your name more often, you were probably on more panels. ", "Yep. ", "I think you\u2019re relatively anonymous right now is one of the reasons I decided to have you here. How important is it for you, an increased profile, either for yourself or for the company? ", "If it\u2019s of benefit to our shareholders, then it\u2019s important, right? And so I think the way I\u2019ve approached myself in this last year as the CEO of J2 \u2014 and it\u2019s only been one year \u2014 is to very much just focus on results, focus on getting to know our shareholder base and our analyst universe. And I\u2019ve known them, but not certainly in this seat, so that\u2019s been super important.", "I think what we want to make sure of, are those who invest in public companies who would consider buying a share of JCOM, which is our ticker symbol, that the information Is out there for them to make an informed choice. That\u2019s important. ", "But there is some sales in this, right? You do need to sort of raise ... I mean, human beings are human beings, right? And if they haven\u2019t heard of the company and you need to start explaining to them what the company is, that is a harder sell than if they, \u201cI know what Time Warner ...\u201d", "I think building awareness of the company amongst those stakeholders is important, so I wouldn\u2019t dispute that. Getting personal recognition and seeing my name out there doesn\u2019t ...", "Look, you\u2019re on the ", "Recode Media", " podcast, come on. How good is that? ", "Well, because I like you, Peter. ", "Thank you. Now this is going to ... You\u2019re going to zip right up to the top of most-admired CEOs.", "Of course. Of course. No, but listen, again there are plenty of great companies that produce terrific shareholder returns, that like us are very much focused on results and less focused on press and less focused on bringing attention to ourselves. If you look in the media industry, there seems to be a correlation between the things that have most buzz and working least seem to be highly correlated. ", "I\u2019m nodding, quietly. ", "So I don\u2019t know. You know, I don\u2019t think we need to overthink it, but to your point, look, you\u2019re right. We\u2019re probably ... I\u2019ve said this, we are the largest internet company that many people have never heard of. I mean at $4 billion of enterprise value, that\u2019s a public number. That\u2019s not a made-up number, it\u2019s a real number.", "We get repriced every second of every day as a public company. Yeah, there should be more awareness of what we\u2019re doing and how we\u2019re doing it.

One is that it is on the cusp of this transition into perhaps a different sort of industry where the podcast might be more produced and have more of a show-like feeling. So, you could go your own route, but if you\u2019re going to go your own route, for me you have to be a business person. You have to go out and find advertising. You have to go out and find a producer. You have to go find studio space. ", "I realized, for better or worse, I\u2019m not interested in that side of things.

", "But if you look at what happened with video, where everybody thought this was going to be huge and there was going to be so much advertising and it turned into compression pretty quickly with Google and Facebook siphoning off a lot of the available money.

They could be selling socks \u2014 like the fine Mack Weldon socks I\u2019m wearing here, promo code: recode. It could be Robinhood. Sometimes there\u2019s a GE or something, but most of the stuff is someone getting someone to do something. They want you to buy or sign up for something. Why is that happening now and is that going to change?", "MW:", " I think with any new media that comes out, you tend to have the performance marketing groups go after it first. First of all, the price of entry tends to be pretty low and they\u2019re willing to say, \u201cIf we can test it and learn, see it work, etc., then we want to invest in that.\u201d That\u2019s usually what happens.", "So, What are examples of a new medium starting and performance marketing showing up first before anybody else?", "MW: ", "Well, long-form TV, 30-minute television, is a good example.

Now let me just say in full disclosure, I\u2019m a physician and we got nailed by Grassley and this conflict of interest thing when in some cases, it was justified. But in many it wasn\u2019t.

The largest player in China is a company called Himalaya, represented in the United States now in conversations and that kind of thing. Their business model, it\u2019s robust as he mentioned, is built around education. And people use the podcast, which is mobile-delivered, \u201cI can use it when I want to, where I want to, at the time I want to,\u201d as an educational tool that people will pay to learn economics. ", "They will pay to learn another language and they use ", "that", ", that\u2019s where the business model for Himalaya comes from is that educational window. And so it is different than ours. Theirs is more, it\u2019s not an education model. It\u2019s not how we learn an additional subject. It\u2019s how we\u2019re entertained or informed or what have you. So just a little context there.", "JW:", " But there\u2019s a bit of an idea that you will pay for education and even here, something more like The Great Courses-plus. So some people will pay to learn something, but they don\u2019t have the same expectation about paying to be entertained, at least in audio form.", "Question here. Hello.", "Audience member: ", "Hi Peter. I will say as someone who ran the New York Times Knowledge Network, people don\u2019t pay for the education part either. I moderated a session the other day about sensory experiences with audio. So we were talking about ASMR and these different pieces.

And I\u2019m curious that ", "Radiolab", " aesthetic to Jacob\u2019s earlier point about why we listen to the ads and that kind of thing. I felt like there were some delightful experiences that public radio kind of trained us for. And I\u2019m wondering if you could speak to that a little bit because I\u2019m curious about the ambient part and how, if we\u2019re listening longer, what makes us listen?", "There is a sameness to a certain strata of podcasts, right? ", "Radiolab", " sounds a lot like other shows. A lot of these shows all came out of public radio. But they don\u2019t all sound the same. Joe Rogan doesn\u2019t sound like that. Adam Carolla doesn\u2019t sound like that. Do you think that we\u2019re going to have more and more different kinds of voices or do you think there\u2019s actually kind of a thing that we all want to hear? I assume Bethany\u2019s will sound more like ", "Radiolab", " than Joe Rogan, for instance.", "JW:", " I think podcasting as a whole comes a lot out of the world of public radio and it largely reflects the values of public radio. It loves narrative. It loves high-quality sound design. It\u2019s a little uncomfortable with opinion and argument for lots of reasons. ", "Radiolab", " is probably the ultimate expression of this, of what public radio people would make for themselves. ", "And I think podcasting, you take a lot of those rules away. You take away the 60-minute clock, you take away the FCC, you take away the fear that the congressman is going to get up and yell at you about your funding being taken away. And you\u2019re much freer to express a point of view. And maybe there\u2019s a little less ... there\u2019s plenty of great storytelling in podcasting, but it doesn\u2019t have to be the only thing you do.", "But it doesn\u2019t have a similar sound. But maybe I\u2019m just obsessed about that. Next question.", "Audience member: ", "I\u2019m Guillermo, founder of Radio Cat. The question is about virality. You mentioned that a podcast aren\u2019t viral. You think that that is inherent to the format or perhaps the lack of the tools in the listening tools to share? For example, if I may need segment on so easy to listen for just following the link for the instead of studying or app. So perhaps there\u2019s lots of friction forbidding the virality of the podcast.", "Would it would be easier to make podcasts go viral if we had better tools to make them go viral?", "JW:", " I don\u2019t know what you think, which I think the biggest factor is Facebook doesn\u2019t support podcasting. I don\u2019t mean they don\u2019t support it as a concept, but it doesn\u2019t work the way video does on Facebook. They haven\u2019t dedicated any effort to making podcasts or audio sharable on that or on other major social platforms. And the main support has come through Apple. So that\u2019s dictated just sort of how it works.", "MW:", " I mean, Apple represents 65 percent of the ecosystem. ", "I\u2019ve noticed whenever \u2014 we do transcripts and write-ups of all our podcasts \u2014 and even when those things explode and we embed a player, and so you can listen to the podcast right here. So there\u2019s zero friction. You hit a button, you get to listen to it. The people who are reading those stories are not interested in listening to a podcast. It\u2019s a different audience. So we can make it as simple as possible and it has yet to translate.", "MW:", " I think that\u2019s accurate. The audiences are different. The thing that makes podcasting so ... It\u2019s the innate mobility of it. I mean, if I want to gather that content, I can\u2019t drive and read my Vanity Fair publication, but I can listen to it.", "Although I just heard, I\u2019m going to betray someone\u2019s confidence here, that Vanity Fair did 400,000 downloads of a Nick Bilton podcast about Theranos because the ", "story", " had gone viral.

It\u2019s been really helpful. So I have a two-parter around metrics. So the first piece is we\u2019ve done a lot of advertising and we send them either to a unique page or have a code. And we find that because it\u2019s not a direct click that listeners may not go to that page. They may go to just the landing page of the advertiser. And that\u2019s I guess the first part is, how do you work with that with marketers and kind of have them see the holistic picture and measure success? And then the second question I have is around downloads versus streams. We find that a lot of listeners will just stream as opposed to download. Why the focus on downloads over total listens?", "Because of you, Marshall.", "MW:", " Everybody\u2019s looking at me. So, first of all, bless you for asking the first part of your question because it is a constant in our world to try to interpret the data that we get, because as much we promote, go to our vanity URL or enter my code at checkout or whatever, we forget. We don\u2019t do it. We go to Google and we type in the name of the company and we buy the product through that, even if we\u2019re going to sacrifice a discount or special offer we may get. So all of our clients use that because there is a percentage, it\u2019s relatively low percentage of people who use that vanity tool, that code.", "Most of our clients also use an interstitial single-paying survey that comes up during the transaction flow that says, \u201cHow\u2019d you hear about us?\u201d And we use that as a proxy or a metric to try and shore up that data. It\u2019s at best, an educated guess. But it is still, even with that educated guess, we\u2019ve found that it\u2019s fundamentally a very successful channel for us. We are working, trying, working diligently to figure out that linkage between an ad being consumed and through some pixel-based tracking or what have you, somebody going to the branded web page, a conversion page, etc. So we\u2019re getting there. And what was second part of your question?", "Audience member: ", "Second, the streams.", "Downloads versus stream. Do you care?", "MW:", " No I don\u2019t, not from an advertising standpoint.", "Do you think the industry cares?", "MW:", " Not at this point.", "Are you being told they care?", "Audience member: ", "I guess I just ... We hear \u201cdownloads\u201d all the time and I was just curious from the perspective of does listens count towards that number?", "MW:", " We look at downloads. And that is a good question because as Spotify moves into this and it becomes an app-based delivery system versus download, RSS feed downloads ...", "Because you won\u2019t download on Spotify because you have Spotify, right?", "MW:", " You\u2019ll go through the Spotify app. It\u2019s still a relatively small number of streams versus downloads. Downloads is still the lion\u2019s share. But, I think it\u2019s something we very much need to keep our eye on going forward. And so we\u2019ll ...", "Thank you. We can answer ... Sorry. Go on.", "MW:", " No, go ahead.", "We can fit in a couple more questions if we go quick.", "Audience member: ", "Yeah, I have a question. I listen to the ", "Exponent", " podcast and they have an episode about Spotify\u2019s entrance into this market. And I\u2019m curious to hear your thoughts about their argument that Spotify could come in and make huge waves by the fact that they solve a lot of the problems you\u2019ve raised like around discoverability, around getting analytics and metrics for player listener behavior in terms of downloads and like how far they listen. And also just simplifying the whole space for integration of ads. It wasn\u2019t really raised so much in this conversation, so I was curious.", "So we all get that \u2014 we\u2019re all excited because Spotify said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to spend a lot of money on podcasts.\u201d That\u2019s good for all of us. But beyond that, are they going to fundamentally change or solve some of these problems?", "JW: ", "One thing I think they\u2019re going to do is they\u2019re going to create useful pressure on Apple. So Apple has been a blessing for podcasting. I mean, it exists because of Apple, but they haven\u2019t commercialized it because it\u2019s been too small to be relevant for them. And then unless Apple sees some commercial potential in podcasting, it\u2019s going to be hard for us to do what I was talking about earlier in terms of selling podcasts. ", "You can\u2019t sell a podcast in the podcast app. And I think we would like to see Apple, speaking for myself, we would like to see them feel some pressure. I think Spotify creates some pressure. They probably say they don\u2019t care about it, but I think they\u2019re paying attention. Spotify starts from a very low base but is gaining share and they are inevitably gaining that share largely at the expense of Apple, which starts with a majority of listeners. So, I think ...", "But Jacob, the counter to that is that Apple is going to announce in a couple of weeks, \u201cHere\u2019s our new mega subscription product. It\u2019s going to have some news in there and something. And definitely video because we just spent a couple of billion dollars making TV shows.\u201d My educated hunch is that there won\u2019t be any podcasting in there, in part because it\u2019s not a big enough business for them to care about. The business collectively is maybe half a billion dollars. Apple famously doesn\u2019t care unless they can make a billion dollars or much more on any individual product.", "JW:", " It\u2019s pointed in that direction. And I think Apple, there may be a case to be made to Apple or at Apple that their entry into the business would significantly increase the total. If they started selling a bundled product around podcasts, that could make podcasting a billion-dollar business tomorrow. I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to do.

But my question\u2019s about smart speakers, Google Home, the Amazon Alexa. Have you seen people using this to consume podcasts?

Might be a naive question, but it seems there\u2019s a big advantage to actually having people listening on your platform because you\u2019re at that touchpoint. You can get these kinds of analytics that you guys have been talking about, about the way podcasts are currently distributed and consumed is really not friendly to that. And so how do you create a platform where you can get that data and be part of that interaction given the current climate where people want to download it in a million different places or stream or whatever?", "Do you want to create your own platform or are you happy using the existing Spotify, Facebook, Apple, and all these other giant distribution points that exist already?", "JW", ": I think you\u2019ve just explained why so many podcasts companies have been drawn to create their own platform.

", "The big thing was, I\u2019m preempting this here, talking about Obama, but the big event was the Obama-Oprah event in Montecito and Santa Barbara in 2007. That was one where we were involved in the Obama campaign and that\u2019s one that had just such interest nationally, at the time. But you know, I was able to be, after Oprah herself, the largest fundraiser for it, just because there were so many people that would ...", "Oprah and Steve Spinner.", "Yeah, no. There is a cool picture about that, but that\u2019s about the extent of that. ", "But let\u2019s just drill down a little more on how fundraising is done and what made what you were doing different. I mean, fundraising is not that different from basic human relationships where you\u2019re thinking about people you know, and you try and bond with people that ... You\u2019re not just going around and saying, \u201cHello, these are the Forbes 400, let\u2019s ask each of them for $2,700.\u201d Basically you\u2019re using, I\u2019m assuming, I\u2019m sure at first, Silicon Valley, the people you know in town. Describe the art of the ask. How\u2019s it done? Pre-RevUp.", "Before RevUp and even before me, historically, for fundraising at very high levels, let\u2019s just talk about the presidential level. Let\u2019s talk about Obama in 2007, since I just preempted it with my last comment about Oprah. Before 2007, what had happened in 2004, what happened in 2000 and even in the \u201990s, a lot times the best \u201cfundraisers\u201d at the time were uber-wealthy individuals who had for many, many years been extremely, exceedingly generous with their own funds, giving to their causes, more importantly giving to others\u2019 causes as well, so that when they got passionate about a candidate that they wanted to see be president and they wanted to open their home and be a fundraiser, that that\u2019s when they would start cashing their chits and say, \u201cHey, remember when I helped you with your fundraising effort over there? Can I have you help me over here with mine?\u201d And there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, whatsoever. That\u2019s the way any type of fundraising goes, whether it be philanthropic or political.", "That\u2019s the way it worked because those were big dollars being asked and given by big people. And you do it, law of big numbers, and those were the biggest fundraisers at the time and a lot of them got the perks of it, being the ambassadors and so forth.", "Sure. And some of the big fundraisers are brand marquee names, you know, the George Soroses of the world, the Oprahs of the world. A lot of these people are celebrities asking other celebrities for money.", "Correct. Correct. And you know, that obviously could not be me. I mean, I was super, super excited about Senator Obama at the time. I was one of the first 50 people to get involved in the campaign, months before it was officially announced in early February of 2007. And I just wanted to help. Couldn\u2019t do it full time, didn\u2019t want to do it full time, wanted to still have a job, still have a career, but be able to help where I could. Which was, if I can\u2019t write a big check, and even at the time they couldn\u2019t take them. It was $2,300 max you could individually write. But I could help by being a fundraiser. ", "And by being a fundraiser, it meant not calling all these chits because I didn\u2019t have those. It was, as I had mentioned, just research and get to know my friends. And at the time, I had about 2,000 people that I knew \u2014 broadly defined, \u201cknew\u201d \u2014 through LinkedIn and Facebook. Again, it\u2019s so many years ago, this was the early stages of social media. And I would just be very, very careful about just understanding and I\u2019d have copious notes, copious pads of paper about who liked what. As I was mentioning earlier, who liked to go to big events or small events or who could write big checks or write only small checks. Who would like to travel for events, who\u2019d like to go to a climate change event or a women\u2019s-only event, at the time. ", "And I just always tried to be very, very careful to put the right ask in front of the right person at the right time. And if you do that, you do that well, then rather than this 0.0001 yield that online does is you get 40 percent yield, 50, 60, 70 percent yield.", "And obviously, this is a very much an underdog story, but it\u2019s not as if you knew zero people with means in America. ", "Oh, of course. No, I mean, I knew some, but I didn\u2019t know them necessarily in this vein so much. It\u2019s just when you write, when you take an email and you just customize the top line of it and you just recognize that, you know, \u201cTeddy, great seeing you the other day. I know you\u2019re particularly interested in climate change events. Here\u2019s a really good one for you.\u201d All of a sudden, you\u2019re going to read that email, you\u2019re going to recognize that that\u2019s a unique email that was sent to you and there is a higher likelihood, a higher yield potential, from that. ", "Let\u2019s talk about, you were very, very successful. I mean, I think in 2012, I know we\u2019re jumping around a little bit, but 2012 you were top five. ", "So I started, so in 2007, 2008, I was top 10. ", "Give us a sense of, who were some of the other people in your stratosphere? ", "Well, I mean it wouldn\u2019t be a lot of names that people that follow here would necessarily recognize and so forth. But there were a lot of traditional fundraisers in there and I was one of the few first-time people in the top 30. And it was something I was exceedingly proud of. ", "But what the campaign was really excited [about] was the way that we did it: It was the first time that people had used \u201cdata\u201d in a way that now would be defined as data analytics. Back then, it certainly wasn\u2019t that classification. And you know, they liked that we got some great press around it and it continued the momentum.", "In 2012, I took that to a whole new level. In 2012, I was reported as being top three in the country. ", "Got it. And how much did that raise in retrospect?", "A lot.", "A lot. Okay. The good thing about this, you can see campaign disclosures, but campaign fundraising is in some ways like venture fundraising. It\u2019s very competitive. There is some ego involved and who\u2019s raised what. Steve has focused more on raising what is now $2,700 chunks. But just for folks who are not aware, there\u2019s a whole world of \u2014 which we can get into a bit \u2014 so-called soft money, which is super PACs and millions of dollars. And that\u2019s not the world you are involved in. ", "That\u2019s not the world I live in. I liked the hard money, the official, the FEC-reported money, where people are proud to make the contribution and there are limits. There are limits. I like a world of limits. ", "And I would deal with everything from the max of not just the 2,700s but to the committees of the DNCs, the DSCCs, DCCCs, the victory funds and so forth, which would be up to $75,000 in total. But not this stuff that you read about, the hundreds of thousands, certainly millions or even tens of millions of dollars. That\u2019s a world that I have not played in for professional, political and personal reasons. ", "Do you ever step back and reflect on how crazy the last ... I\u2019m sure, you know, you were talking before about how you never really been ... you didn\u2019t grow up seeing yourself as a political animal. But you made it into the top tier of finance folks, basically just through hard work and an innovative idea that, \u201cI\u2019m going to be more strategic about how it\u2019s done.\u201d", "But also, and I appreciate that, and there is obviously a great amount of truth to that, but it\u2019s also to do it in a way that is putting the donor first. Being respectful. I\u2019ve said that a couple of times. I say that a gazillion times. Respect in fundraising, I can\u2019t say that enough, how important that is, not just for me but for anyone who wants to do it, whether it be for politics or whether it be for nonprofits or academic fundraising. Anything you do, if you can be respectful of the other person, you\u2019re more likely to have a positive outcome and they\u2019ll feel really good about it as well. ", "And then the last thing is that you had mentioned the competitiveness of it. Absolutely. Historically, it had been terribly competitive and in some cases, it still persists. What I\u2019ve always enjoyed is working collaboratively, working in teams, sharing credit, that the whole is greater than the individual parts.", "And so it\u2019s not just the individual fundraising I did, but you know, I wrote the business plan for Tech for Obama, wrote the business plan for Obama Victory Trustees, wrote the business plan for South Asians for Obama because, you know, obviously the white Jew in me, that\u2019s obvious that I would write that business plan. But those efforts, together, raised many, many, many multiples of what I as an individual could. But you do it so that everyone participates. Everyone gets credit for it. It\u2019s the big tent kind of thing. ", "And that\u2019s where the real value of what I was able to do came in. Because you know, my time, there\u2019s only a certain amount of time I can [put in] as a volunteer fundraiser, there\u2019s only so many people I know. But if you can build initiatives that take hold, that grow roots and that, not just one or five or 10 or 20 people, but 100 or 300 people can participate in and they can make it their own, then you can have this huge, huge, huge multiplier effect and raise that much more money. ", "So let\u2019s finish the story here. So after 2012, you\u2019ve pioneered this new way, you\u2019re still fundraising voluntarily. ", "I\u2019m still doing it manually. ", "Still looking at it manually. This is, and remember, you didn\u2019t grow up dreaming of inventing political fundraising software.", "Absolutely not.", "How did this idea for RevUp come about? ", "So one of my closest friends is Ro Khanna, and he had been running for Congress. Obviously, I wanted to help him. I was helping him on the fundraising side, and a lot of opportunity came up where people had been reaching out to me about what I\u2019d been doing for Obama and would that be available, would I help them individually for this race or that race, etc. It\u2019s just one of those things where there\u2019s only one of me and as flattering as it is I don\u2019t like to say no, but I just don\u2019t have enough time to say yes to everyone.", "What\u2019s your day job at this point?", "At that time I was helping ... Well, I helped with Obama with the re-elect and I was planning what to do next.", "Kind of stewing, yeah.", "Yeah, so I was helping Ro from a campaign perspective, but I was getting ready to either join a tech company out here or start my next thing.", "Got it.", "So in that period of time of figuring out what I wanted to do next, I realized what we had done, what we had accomplished for Obama-world had been really unique and really successful. It was something unique that I had done and that there could be an opportunity to help many, many campaigns. So that\u2019s what I wanted to do, so we started doing that. ", "Spoke to the lawyers, made sure that we could do it the way that we wanted to do it because it had never been done before, spoke to both sides of the aisle because the only way you could do what I wanted to do was if it was ", "not", " a partisan play. Even though I\u2019m a Democrat and I\u2019m a well-known Democrat, from the get-go, since incorporation, we had to treat it like a tech company, which means, just like Google and Twitter and Facebook and Salesforce works with anyone out there that wants to buy the software or leverage the technology, we would have to be the same thing. Which politically is a challenge for me, but professionally and personally, you have to ... I mean you have to do ...", "Totally. Yeah, right.", "Yeah, I have a fiduciary responsibility to do what\u2019s best for the company and for investors. The product could thrive if it just had more people using it and testing it and so on and so forth, so Ro was our, he was our prototype client, then we moved to 15 clients for the next year. Then we moved to 50 clients after that. These are clients or campaigns or committees or organizations that are trying to raise money that are in the political sector.", "This is 2013?", "No, 2014.", "2014, okay.", "The idea came to me in 2013, but we started building the software in February of 2014. So as I said, Ro was our prototype in that year.", "Ro is now, ", "he\u2019s been on the podcast before", ". He\u2019s now the Congressman for Silicon Valley.", "He is. He loves coming down here.", "Good. Let\u2019s just show them a little bit more what this is. In the old days, there were professional political fundraisers who probably had something they would call software. What is RevUp and how does it work? I know it\u2019d be easier if you showed me on your phone or computer screens, but verbally, let\u2019s give it a shot.", "Oh, I can communicate it verbally. For anyone out there listening, imagine you\u2019re someone that ... you\u2019re inspired by a candidate or you\u2019re inspired to help out a nonprofit or someone you know reaches out to you from a campaign or from your university that you went to or nonprofit that you\u2019re supporting, and ropes you into, brings you in to be a fundraiser. The initial use case for the software was as a fundraiser tool for a volunteer, for a \u201cbundler,\u201d as they call them. If you put yourself in that light as everyone\u2019s imagining that, you all have jobs. You all do something else for your life. If you\u2019re gonna do this, this is not something that you have comfort in. It\u2019s outside of your day job. ", "So you\u2019ve committed, you\u2019ve said, \u201cYes, I\u2019ll help.\u201d And you\u2019re sitting in front of your computer and you have no idea who you should ask, to help. We all know many people, everyone knows hundreds of people, some of us even know thousands of people. Well, what do you do? You have two choices. You can either send out one email about the opportunity that you\u2019re fundraising for, to everyone. That\u2019s not fundraising, that\u2019s spamming your network and hoping that some people respond. But that\u2019s actually what the vast, vast, vast majority of people do.", "BCC, \u201cHi, I\u2019m trying to raise a million dollars for candidate X.\u201d", "Exactly.", "\u201cCan you give 2,700 bucks?\u201d", "Or $27.", "Yeah, right.", "Or $5. It\u2019s spamming your network. Whatever comes in you\u2019ve raised, so in that case you\u2019re a fundraiser. A lot of times most of it you won\u2019t get and ...", "That\u2019s a low-dollar approach to high-dollar giving.", "Right, but anyone that\u2019s doing it, it\u2019s an any-dollar approach.", "Yeah, an any-dollar approach.", "It\u2019s the only way that they know how because their time is valuable and they have no information to know any better, to do any better. They\u2019re doing the best that they can with limited information. That\u2019s the whole point. The other way of doing it is that you say, \u201cYou know what, an individual ask or an individual email or an email to a small group of people that\u2019s customized is likely to have a higher yield.\u201d ", "But who should I ask? I still know the same thousands of people. So you sit there and you start thinking through your Rolodex or thinking through your mental contact list here, and maybe even you might actually even look through your LinkedIn list and so forth. You\u2019re one by one by one going through this, and as you\u2019re doing it, you\u2019re like, \u201cThis is the most unprofessional, inefficient way possible.\u201d And you get frustrated and you push your computer away and you procrastinate.", "That simple act of procrastination causes that fundraising effort to fail by 50 percent, right there, and every day that you continue to procrastinate, add another 5 percent to the failure rate. Until finally, eventually you\u2019re like, \u201cOh my god, there\u2019s only six days to the event and I haven\u2019t done much yet. I gotta buckle down and do it.\u201d ", "You start just reaching out to top-of-mind people that come to you, people that you think are individually wealthy, people that you think individually might be interested in this, people that owe you chits, just completely top of mind. As you\u2019re doing it, you\u2019re like, \u201c95 percent of the people I should be reaching out to I\u2019m not reaching out to, and I\u2019m reaching out to a whole bunch of people that I probably shouldn\u2019t be reaching out to. I\u2019m never gonna do this again.\u201d Usually, it fails. ", "So with that in mind we said, \u201cThat\u2019s the problem.\u201d No one in business would conduct their work that way, just winging it, sending out one email to every vendor out there and hoping that someone replies or just, without any research, reaching out to people indiscriminately. We would do research. We would try to handle it in a professional, efficient manner. We don\u2019t do that in fundraising. ", "So what the software does is we said ... so it\u2019s data analytics on the fundraising side. It is ", "not", " the system of record. It\u2019s not the CRM. We don\u2019t compete with any of the companies out there that take the money through their system.", "You\u2019re not actually raising the money. It\u2019s a way to organize the contacts for raising money.", "We\u2019re not the links that the money\u2019s going into, and so there are a bunch of different companies out there of all different sizes. Those were all of our partners. We are very, very careful not to do anything like that. What we do is we help the fundraiser, or now we also help \u2014 disproportionately, even \u2014 the finance staff, the development staff, the advancement office. The tool now has transitioned even more so into a staff-driven set of tools.", "We\u2019ll talk about what are you guys doing in the future.", "Yeah. That is ... So now, as a bundler, that same analogy is now with one click you can upload your Gmail, your Outlook, your LinkedIn, your contacts, your iPhone contacts, any Excel spreadsheet CSV list you have. If you know thousands of people, it will merge, purge, de-dupe them, clean them all up, single Rolodex.", "And then it goes out to thousands of political and charitable databases and it will bring all that data, put it against your contacts, put it against the profile of the organization that you\u2019re raising for, and based on that profile of that organization and all those 10,000 databases, will then force rank every single person you know highest to lowest likelihood to be interested in potentially giving.", "So at that point it\u2019s like ... Let\u2019s say you\u2019re raising for Ro Khanna\u2019s campaign and you have someone in Palo Alto who is a doctor who\u2019s given money to Democratic Congressional candidates sometimes, not always. Maybe they\u2019re South Asian, and then it matches it up with, okay, Ro Khanna, he\u2019s a new candidate. He\u2019s South Asian, and it matches up and says, \u201cOkay, maybe this person ... they should be in the 75th percentile for the people you call.\u201d ", "Then someone else who has only given to Republicans for their entire life but the last six years they\u2019ve given to every single Democrats, suddenly it\u2019s an easy ask. It\u2019s basically a way of ordering the thousands of people you know into how you should prioritize your time.", "Right. The part that I\u2019m particularly attracted to is not going back to the same well over and over and over again. That\u2019s a major, major problem in political giving, is that the same people are getting hit up many times every single day. If you can believe this, only 2 percent of the US population gives money to politics.", "That\u2019s higher than I thought, actually.", "Most of that money is by .1 of 1 percent.", "Sure.", "And so everyone calls the same folks and everyone really, really calls that .1 percent. So yes, this software will certainly have that 2 percent in there and certainly will have the .1 percent in there and it\u2019ll say, have they given before but they haven\u2019t given currently? Have they given less now than they normally give? So go back and ask for more. Have they given to other things like you, but they don\u2019t know you, so maybe if they only knew you, they\u2019d want to give to you? ", "Absolutely, we go, and there\u2019s many different types of filters and parts of the algorithm that will boost people up and boost people down, of people that have historically given. Absolutely. My passion is to go after the other 98 percent, introduce it to people that have never given before. The Ro Khanna example, as you just mentioned. Sure, there are some wonderful donors in the tech and the South Asian community that have given to politics before ...", "Those are the obvious people.", "And those have been some of his donors.", "Those would be like the top-of-mind person. Maybe that person doesn\u2019t even need the software for that person.", "Exactly. Well no, you always need the software ...", "You have to be clear, yeah.", "You always need to know in what order and how fast and what\u2019s the likelihood and what\u2019s the appropriate ask and all that good stuff. Again, you\u2019re trying to be respectful here. But the power of it was to go and identify people who had ", "never", " written a check, is on no one\u2019s list, but maybe because they\u2019re a South Asian male in tech living in Silicon Valley, maybe rather than a 90 or an 80 or a 70 score, rather than getting a zero score, maybe you get a 43 score. You focus your time and energy around people in the 60s and the 50s and the 40s. People that no one talks to, no one reaches out. ", "Most people don\u2019t even know they exist, but because there are hooks, respectful hooks of potential interests, of attractiveness, of a connection that that campaign or that organization or that university might have with that person, isn\u2019t it a better thing to grow the pie and go after people that nobody goes out to, and there\u2019s a much higher likelihood of them saying yes because there\u2019s no competition for the same dollar?", "Wouldn\u2019t the pushback be, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard this before, that part of any human relationship is just the soft touch and the ability to ... Maybe there\u2019s some, oh, you know, they don\u2019t check any of the demographic or historical attributes that would indicate this person\u2019s likely to give, but maybe you\u2019re just really good friends with them and you feel like ... Or maybe you saw them last week at the coffee shop and there was just that human connection that the software can\u2019t predict. How do you deal with that?", "Look, you should always preference people you know and touch points that are more current and more accurate. So if you know things about people that are outside of software, that trumps anything that any software will give you.", "So even if it says \u201cthis person\u2019s not a giver\u201d and you just have a, maybe just something in your belly that makes you think this person will give, you should still hit them up.", "Right. They\u2019re not a giver, ", "yet", ". That\u2019s the whole thing. They haven\u2019t given yet. That\u2019s the part that I find is both the opportunity as well as the challenge, and I like the opportunity part. ", "Let\u2019s talk a little bit about what you\u2019re doing now. You guys just raised $7.5 million. You announced it last week or a couple weeks ago.", "Yep, about a week ago.", "By the time this is airing, probably a couple weeks ago. Your background is in politics, this came up as a political idea, but you mentioned development offices, endowments. Just for the grand scheme of things, political fundraising is a very small amount of the fundraising world, overall.", "Correct.", "So this is a bid to make the Princeton University development office or a hospital or anybody that\u2019s raising money, you\u2019re now pitching this as a software for anybody who has to cull a database and figure out who to call.", "Exactly. So if you think about giving last year and fundraising in the United States, it went up to, it crossed $400 billion that this country was generous to open up their wallets and give. Of that, only 7 billion, in total, over two years in this cycle goes to politics.", "People act like ... that\u2019s always the common criticism of campaign finance reformers, who say there\u2019s so much money in politics, and I think it\u2019s Mitch McConnell or maybe John Boehner who has this quote about more money being spent on toothpaste than on politics.", "Exactly. That is, unfortunately, true. The reason why that feels the way it is is that so much money is used on broadcast television because it\u2019s still exceedingly effective to getting out the message, so everyone sees it. So they see more money, more ads, and you just get oversaturated with ads. ", "The other reason why is that a very, very small percent of the population is just getting hit up so much and they\u2019re very, very vocal about that, as they should be. So that\u2019s why you\u2019re getting that view. So the much larger market, by so many orders of magnitude, are nonprofits at large, and especially as you mentioned, higher ed and healthcare as very large components within that. That is what we\u2019re doing with the software. ", "We\u2019ve had a very successful couple years coming out with first our prototype, our alpha, our beta, coming out of self mode a couple years ago growing. We now serve nearly about 300 campaigns and committees and so forth. We\u2019ll continue to grow that. ", "Next year will be super-exciting given that it will be a presidential cycle and so many races as well there, but we did do the financing to very specifically go into the larger markets and do what we do in data analytics, working with the CRMs, with them as partners, but now go into these larger categories and do exactly what we\u2019ve done in politics into these larger categories, because they\u2019re chomping at the bit for next-generation type of tools.", "These are pretty, not stodgy institutions but these are, they have the formal development offices. These are ... Is there any party that worries about just some of the skills not translating or some of the software not translating?", "I mean, look. Everyone does it in their own way. There\u2019s certainly best practices of how a lot of these organizations do it, and these are very, very professional people. The larger the organization, the more people they have and the more structured they tend to be. As a result, the more professional they can be. They have more staff, they can have more tools, they can have more training, etc. ", "But there are half a million nonprofits. Everyone\u2019s raising. It just depends on how much resources you have at your disposal, and so we just want to be a tool to complement what they\u2019re currently using. I know a lot of these guys are using, whether it be Raiser\u2019s Edge or Blackbaud or they\u2019re working with Salesforce and probably a hundred other companies out there as a system of record to be able to help them on the data analytics side for both staff as well as volunteers to have the same level of effect in those verticals as I\u2019m honored to say that we\u2019ve had success this last few years. ", "We\u2019ve been just blessed with all the awards in the industry that we\u2019ve won. We won best fundraising technology, most innovative product of the year two years in a row, best startup, best analytics. We deployed our mobile app last year. We won the award for best mobile app. ", "What we\u2019re doing as a data analytics company has not been done before in these three verticals, and what I\u2019m super proud of, where I\u2019ve lived for the past two decades, is to be a Silicon Valley company bringing Silicon Valley tech to these three verticals that have historically not had the opportunity to benefit from that, at least from a data analytics perspective.", "It\u2019s well known on the internet that you\u2019re a Democrat.

I\u2019ve had to cut back in many cases, which is very, very hard for me on a personal level because that\u2019s my genesis in all this. But for instance, we\u2019ll be very involved in the presidential races next year. I won\u2019t, as an individual, be able to participate because how can I be personally helping one when I\u2019m working with 5, 10, 15, 20 people that may or may not be running? ", "Sure. ", "On a personal level I\u2019ve had to do some cutting back. I mean, I still help this candidate over here or this candidate over there. ", "Obviously you\u2019re still involved with Ro Khanna. ", "I\u2019m still helping Ro. There\u2019s this guy, Sri Kulkarni in Houston, Texas, who is a very, very exciting candidate, that is basically the Ro equivalent on the foreign policy side. He\u2019s 14 years State Department, and a bunch of different very, very challenging environments, placements he\u2019s been over the years. He speaks six languages fluently. A very exciting candidate there that\u2019s running in a Houston district. I\u2019ve been helping them as well. ", "I still help a number of candidates here or there. But, where I really, really dug in and was National Finance Committee and chairman of this, or co-chairman of that, and so forth, I probably won\u2019t be able to do.", "Give up those fancy titles.", "How can you do that when you\u2019re helping them from a professional purposes? That\u2019s the whole point, which is that\u2019s how I can work with Republicans as well as Democrats. That\u2019s how I can work with multiple Democrats in the same race. ", "Because they can all use the software. ", "Right. Here we are in the state of California and on the Dems side there\u2019ll be races where there were four, five, six candidates in the same race for a Congressional district that we just experienced for the last year and a half here. In June, most of those, all but one or two will lose. But we were able to help with multiples of them because we\u2019re just a tech company. So, if you pick exclusives then you\u2019re trying to pick horses. You\u2019re not really a tech company whatsoever. ", "And then you\u2019re part of the advocacy apparatus. ", "Yeah. You can\u2019t build a ...", "You\u2019re trying to be a Google or Facebook software platform that folks can use or not use.

People that know that we sometimes have clients on the opposite side of the aisle, it\u2019s never been an issue in four years. Where I take that as one of the things I\u2019m honestly most proud of is because I\u2019m a proud Dem. I\u2019m a card-carrying, scar-ridden Dem, that I can meet with Republicans. I mean, where did I meet you, Teddy, originally? I met you ...", "I think it was the Mitt Romney E2 Conference. ", "Exactly. ", "Which I was covering when I was at at CNN. I want to talk about how fundraising has changed a little bit over time. You start in 2005, this is pre-Citizens United. This is one of the key Supreme Court decisions that created super PACs. I think there\u2019s been a lot of discussion in the media. People in my industry used to cover political money about, has Trump changed the game at all with fundraising? I\u2019m just curious. We\u2019re coming up on the 2020 cycle, is fundraising different than it was a decade ago? ", "It\u2019s much larger. ", "Sure. ", "I mean it\u2019s much, much larger. It\u2019s much more successful online than it\u2019s been. Every four years, you get this new bar that it crosses, and you don\u2019t think it can get any more successful than that. And of course, four years later it\u2019s twice as much as it was before. So yeah, it continues to evolve. There\u2019s still a long, long ways to go. There is a certain amount of marrying of spray and pray. Blind fundraising just increased the size of the list and you don\u2019t care about the terms. ", "Right. This is online, low dollar. ", "Yeah. ", "You\u2019re on the Beto O\u2019Rourke email list. That\u2019s a whole nother industry. That\u2019s not your industry. ", "It\u2019s not me at all. ", "Yeah. ", "I can\u2019t stand it. ", "Yeah. ", "But, it\u2019s the opposite of the respect part that I talk about. ", "Yeah. ", "How many hundreds of fundraising emails do we all get every day? We delete 99 percent of them. ", "Yeah. ", "That I can\u2019t stand. ", "They also have lots of screaming headlines like, \u201cThe country\u2019s in crisis!\u201d", "That\u2019s actually one of the things that\u2019s helped worsen the narrative in politics. It\u2019s on both sides. Pox on everyone. ", "Yeah. ", "The big changes that have happened \u2014 and there are many people that would say this and I\u2019m not the only one \u2014 is Democrats historically always had a huge, huge advantage with small-dollar online donating. That started with Howard Dean in 2004 and it\u2019s only picked up, ever since. ", "For the first time ever in the last couple of years the Republicans with Donald Trump was able to do a certain amount of that and do it quite effectively in 2015, especially in 2016. That\u2019s persisted through this cycle, through the fundraising that they\u2019ve done on the RNC side. But outside of that, one anomaly there on the Republican side, there\u2019s still a huge difference, a huge competitive advantage of small dollar on the Democrat side than on the Republican side. ", "The other thing is that Democrats have ActBlue, which really is a ...", "It\u2019s like a portal. Do you want to describe it?", "It is. It\u2019s just a way to easily be able to make multiple donations over time, stores all your information, makes recommendations and so forth. It\u2019s just been very, very successful for Democrats. They have a company called NGP VAN, which is one of our partners. That\u2019s also very, very good at being the system of record. ", "And so, the technology has always been, historically, an advantage on the Dems side, especially as it deals with small dollars. On the big dollars, and especially on the soft-money dollars, Republicans have historically always had a lead on that, especially obviously ever since Citizens United. ", "Yeah, I just want to explain it for folks. I mean, so basically, the way that lots of campaign dollars were raised today, and the only way they were really raised pre-Citizens United was, there\u2019s a federal limit for how much a donor can give to a campaign, or a committee. And after Citizens United, they created the creation of super PACs. Pools of cash where people can cut checks of unlimited size. That\u2019s what a lot of the headline-grabbing stories are. Peter Thiel giving a million dollars to Club for Growth, or Sheldon Adelson giving 25 million dollars to a party-sponsored Senate super PAC. That\u2019s what people think of when they read a campaign finance story, but then there\u2019s also just the ... I mean $2700 is not nothing obviously, but it\u2019s not 25 from Sheldon Adelson. ", "Right. You have the super PAC where you can write unlimited and it\u2019s disclosed. ", "Correct. ", "There\u2019s also write-unlimited and it\u2019s still not disclosed and that\u2019s what they call \u201cdark money.\u201d Thankfully, that\u2019s decreased, but that\u2019s just still something I\u2019m very, very uncomfortable with, and many, many people are very, very uncomfortable with because of lack of disclosure. ", "Right. I mean, there\u2019s some Democrats that are more and more comfortable with... This is epitomized by Charles and David Koch who created a large of organizations that are 501C4s, so they get some sort of tax exemptions in exchange for being theoretically non-advocacy organizations. ", "Right. But the thing is, I\u2019m always very protective and defensive of donors when they give hard money up to the max. And when I say that, \u201cprotective,\u201d meaning that they\u2019re allowed to do it. And if they want to do it once that\u2019s great, if they want to do it 2500, times they should be allowed to do that. They shouldn\u2019t be hit for donating. I always have a problem when donors get hit because they support when they get criticized. ", "This is all public information. ", "It\u2019s all public information. They\u2019re required to, but they\u2019re doing what they\u2019re allowed to do because they\u2019re inspired to do that. There\u2019s something about that candidate that they like a lot. They can\u2019t necessarily give time. They can\u2019t necessarily travel for them, but they can write $250. They can write maybe $2700. They shouldn\u2019t become part of an attack ad, and some people do that. ", "To be fair, this is on both sides, right? I mean there are ...", "Well, no. It\u2019s usually on the Republican side to Democrats historically. But where it\u2019s really gotten bad is on the larger checks, the soft money. Where now those guys are writing the large checks and they\u2019re getting hit. In many cases they deserve to get hit for that. I like to protect up to the max, the $2700, and then beyond that, it\u2019s discretionary on the donor. ", "This did change with Harry Reid\u2026 Charles and David Koch, for instance, did not used to be household names. They\u2019re obviously extremely wealthy. But, this became a big deal with Harry Reid, who went out there and attacked the Kochs during the 2012 campaign-", "Correct. ", "... by name, I think, on the Senate floor. ", "That\u2019s on the soft money. ", "Yeah. ", "On the big seven, eight, nine figures.", "Sure.", "I\u2019m always very, very protective of when they-", "Someone expressing their democratic right to give $2,700 bucks. ", "Or $250. ", "Yeah. ", "I actually saw a Dem-on-Dem hit piece last week right here in the Bay Area. Two Democrats, an assembly race, and I saw someone doing an online posting there where they were just were hitting people for writing $250, or $500, or $1,000 because they were supporting the other candidate. That really upsets me. ", "Yeah, I think it\u2019s $200, right? Beyond that, that\u2019s when you start getting named in campaign finance reforms. ", "Above $200, yes. ", "Right, okay. ", "You have to disclose. ", "For folks out there, yeah, if you give more than $200 you will be findable by people like me, and I guess people like Steven, and other folks as well. ", "Trump, I mean this is mostly on the Republican side, there\u2019s an argument to be made. I wrote a lot of stories about Trump\u2019s fundraising woes. During 2016, there was a lot of Republican donors like the folks at the Romney Summit we were just talking about who felt Trump is running against the system, draining the swamp. I think it\u2019s led to at least some budding conventional wisdom that political fundraising doesn\u2019t matter anymore. Trump can just hog the airways. The whole point of raising money, presumably, is to buy media attention. To what extent do you think he has actually changed how political fundraising could be done at least? ", "I mean, this is a much longer conversation than the last few minutes of this. He\u2019s definitely changed some aspects of it absolutely. But I do not believe that in the next cycle for the re-elect if he is the candidate on the Republican side, that the media will do in that race, even as a sitting president, what they did in the last one because it was comedy. ", "In terms of campaign coverage. ", "Yeah.", "Yeah. ", "I mean it was Trump 24 hours a day on all networks, not just on the Foxes, but he was also on MSNBC all the time. ", "Sure. ", "As a sitting president, they\u2019re even now starting to cut back. There\u2019s been a lot of news about that over the last month, month and a half that one of the reasons why-", "The rallies aren\u2019t getting live anymore. ", "Well, one of the reasons why the president\u2019s going out so much is because a lot of his comments are not getting covered as much, and the rallies, even those are not getting covered as much. And so, he\u2019s trying to say things that are newsworthy, or he\u2019s trying to make them newsworthy to force him to get coverage like what he did last night in Montana because people are trying to cut back on that because they realize it is an unfair advantage. I mean he won disproportionately ... Well, there were many reasons why Trump won last cycle, but one of them was that he just had so much earned media that he didn\u2019t have to pay a penny for, and 10 times more than his closest competitor, and 100 times more than some of his other competitors. ", "So you don\u2019t feel like that was a moment in time, that Trump was \u2014 maybe there was a media fascination with him? He obviously also self-funded somewhat. He self-funded his Republican primary race almost entirely. He gave some money, not as much as he promised to give during the general to his campaign. But, at least in the primary, right, I mean, he was outspent. That was the whole point. He loved to make fun of Jeb Bush, right? ", "Right. But that\u2019s how he was able to make up for the shortfalls. ", "Right. ", "He did fund himself to the level that he need to get in the game. ", "Yeah. ", "And have a team that he needed. But he was able to more than make up for it with his comments that caused him to get all this extra media. He starts out as having higher name ID than almost anyone else on the stage. ", "Yeah. ", "And so, when you start out with just by your name ID from TV, from \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d being able to have 15, 17, 18 percent support, and name ID of 35, 45, maybe even up to 60 percent name ID, how is anyone else supposed to be able to compete with that?", "Yeah. You see that as not necessarily that consequential for the way that your business of political fundraising has done? ", "No, not for me. I mean you still have to fund your campaigns. The part that actually gets me excited from a RevUp perspective is, historically money is the number one, and the only one that matters in, do you make a decision to run for office, or not? Can I raise the money? And if you believe you can raise the money, then you raise your hand, and you run for office. I actually hate that. I believe that money should ", "not", " be the reason why you decide to run for office. It should just be part of the execution plan. You should run for office because you think you can do a better job, that you can help people, and you can move us in a positive direction. What RevUp can do in politics, and what RevUp can especially do for non-profits and universities is lower the bar for you to more easily be able to raise the amount of money you need, if you\u2019re a candidate, to run a competitive race. ", "Right. Do you agree in general with the idea that money is necessary but not sufficient for competitiveness?", "Yes, yes. You don\u2019t need to have the same amount. You absolutely don\u2019t need to have the same amount. ", "Well, there\u2019s a minimum threshold for ... Beto O\u2019Rourke doesn\u2019t need to have $38 million in a month to be a competitive candidate. He might lose. ", "Absolutely, but yeah, absolutely, or you can have races where you\u2019re raising 28 million dollars and you lose like crazy to someone who you\u2019ve raised three, four times more money. You can have other races where you raised one million dollars and it\u2019s one-fourth the amount of money as the other person and you win handily. ", "Yeah. ", "But you have to raise a certain amount to get in the game. You have to raise to be able to have a team and to be able to get your message out. There are other things that matter, absolutely. That\u2019s why it\u2019s called a campaign. There are many facets of it, but money gets you in the game. That\u2019s what RevUp is focused on in politics, is to lower the bar to make it easier for you to raise the minimum that you need to be able to run a competitive race. The same thing, fulfill the entire mission and charter for a nonprofit and a university. ", "Right. It doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll win, but at least you can kind of play the game. ", "Exactly.

But she\u2019s super fun at a party.", "Anyway, so let\u2019s start with that. This week, yesterday, you\u2019ve had the latest controversy around YouTube, and there\u2019s a controversy a day. Not just YouTube, but Facebook and others ... Was around ", "pedophiles and the use of YouTube as a tool for pedophiles", ". So why don\u2019t you talk a bit about what you all have done, and then I\u2019ll have some questions about what happened in this situation.", "Sure. Sure. So, first of all, I just want to say that we take kids\u2019 safety incredibly seriously, and I\u2019d say also the last two years have really been focused on responsibility of our platforms, and everything we\u2019ve done has been through those lenses of how can we make sure that what we\u2019re doing, the way we\u2019re growing, is through responsibly.", "And so in particular, with this specific incident that happened around child safety, which I take very seriously. I\u2019m a mom. I actually have five children from four to 19, so I understand kids.

The videos were okay. The videos were not violative, but the comments with those videos were, and as soon as we were made aware of them ... The number was in the low thousands ... We removed comments off of tens of millions of videos. We basically did that almost instantly, just in an abundance of caution, to make sure that we were able to stop it. ", "And then in the last week, and just yesterday, we spent time looking at our policies, and we announced some really significant changes, one of which is that we are no longer going to allow comments on videos that are featuring young minors anymore, and older minors that are engaged in risky behavior.

Couple questions.", "Yes.", "\u201dMade aware.\u201d Why didn\u2019t you know that? When I have a platform of my making or something, I know what\u2019s happening on my platform.

I realize how big it is. I realize the technical problem going in, but sometimes it feels as if they don\u2019t have any sense of anyone ... It seems like they live a life that\u2019s very safe. It\u2019s typically white, young men, and they don\u2019t understand the lack of safety for so many other people, not just children. So talk about that.", "Yeah. Well, so I will say we have been very focused on child safety. It wasn\u2019t like we were suddenly made aware and then we started focusing on child safety or comments. We have been doing that for the last couple years. The reason we were actually able to launch a classifier that had double the capacity is because we had been working on that to make sure that we were able to remove those comments. So all of this has been ongoing work.", "The policy change to say we are no longer going to allow comments on minors, featuring young minors is ... We\u2019re a platform that is really balancing between freedom of speech and also managing with our community guidelines. I think there are going to be many young people out there that are going to be upset because they\u2019re going to feel like they\u2019re posting videos and they no longer have the ability to use comments in the way that other creators can to be able to get feedback on their videos about what\u2019s useful, what went well, what should their next video be about, what was successful.

In the end, that was a trade-off that we made because we felt like we wanted to make sure that protecting children was our No. 1 priority.", "So doing a sweeping thing versus consulting, say, the parents, you can\u2019t decide between what ...", "Parents can always decide. So parents can always turn off the comments. That\u2019s a functionality that everybody has. We also have classifiers for people to search through them. We search through them, turn them off if we find anything that\u2019s violative in the comments just automatically, and so we give tools to our creators. But it\u2019s a process where we\u2019re trying to always get better, but in this specific case, we had to make a choice between giving people who are innocent and creating videos themselves and then making a decision about their safety.", "Great, but I get back to the idea that comments are just vile on YouTube. Anyone who\u2019s a woman gets ...", "I have a channel.", "Yes, you have a channel. They\u2019re vile. When you look at them, don\u2019t you say, \u201cWhy is this even occurring? Why am I even allowing this to happen?\u201d", "Well, first of all, we have community guidelines, and YouTube has had community guidelines since the very beginning, and those community guidelines include things like hate speech, and promotion to violence, and all kinds of other core areas that we believe in, but comments ", "is", " a really important part of the platform for creators and fans, and they can always turn it off if they want to.", "Here\u2019s the thing. \u201cThey can always turn it off.\u201d That\u2019s really not ... Like, it\u2019s off or on. It\u2019s not that you are monitoring your platform in a way that\u2019s responsible.", "We do. We do. We do run classifiers. We look at the comments. We actually remove hundreds of millions of comments every quarter that we think are problematic, so we ", "are", " monitoring it. But you have to realize the volume that we have is very substantial, and we\u2019re working to give creators more tools as well for them also to be able to manage it.", "When you talk about the volume, there is the volume, but y\u2019all created it, you know what I mean? Like, I\u2019m sorry \u2014 and it\u2019s not you in particular, but you all \u2014 sometimes it feels like you have all reaped the benefit, but not the responsibility of having a platform, you know what I mean? And again, I think that a lot of the focus has been on Facebook on this, because it looks like, in their case, it\u2019s a lot of sloppy management. That they just didn\u2019t put the rules in place, or the tools in place, or things like that, and I do ... ", "Again, I get that it\u2019s a massive problem, so what are the solutions to this? Because one of the solutions is regulatory. If all of a sudden tomorrow Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act was removed from you all, you\u2019d have to figure it out rather quickly, right? You don\u2019t have a broad immunity. What would you do?", "Well, for the last two years, we have been really, really focused on responsibility, and everything that we do ... Whenever we talk about growth, we always talk about responsible growth. Every change that we make, we\u2019re thinking through the lens of responsibility. And if you look at the number of changes that we\u2019ve made, it\u2019s substantial. ", "I\u2019m happy to talk about more, in all the different areas, whether it\u2019s ... And you have to realize there are many areas. We just touched briefly on child safety. There\u2019s misinformation, there\u2019s foreign government interference, there\u2019s hate. There are many different areas that we\u2019re focused on, and we\u2019ve made a lot of progress. And I want to say there\u2019s more progress to be made, I 100 percent acknowledge it.", "But we, in the last year, have built very significant teams to be able to address this, and to address it not just from a people standpoint, but, this is a technical audience, from a technical point of view, of building up classifiers and machines to be able to identify problems and remove that content.", "So talk about the technical solutions, because that\u2019s always been the ... \u201cAI is going to fix it,\u201d whatever, and Casey Newton just wrote a great piece in The Verge about Facebook, people who go through Facebook videos, and they all want, the people who watch the conspiracy videos suddenly believe in conspiracies, they\u2019re being badly affected, they\u2019re having sex in the stairwells, it\u2019s like crazy. They watch this stuff and they get warped. ", "Obviously, humans are not going to be the way you\u2019re going to figure this out, but you have to put humans to the test. Talk about this, what could be done.", "Well, we have to use humans and machines. And it\u2019s the combination of using humans to generate basically what we\u2019ll call the golden set or the initial set, the set that our machines can learn from. And then it\u2019s the machines that go out and actually extend all this amazing knowledge that the humans have, and to be able to do that at scale.", "So we have 500 hours being uploaded every minute to YouTube, and the only way to solve this, at the end of the day, is going to be with a combination of human and machines. And if we actually started releasing a transparency report, and if you look at the transparency report, you can see how the machines have ramped up in the last year. And in Q ... we\u2019re about to release Q4 report, but in Q3, we removed over... almost 8 million videos. And of those, 75 percent of them were removed with machines, and of that 75 percent the majority didn\u2019t even have a single view. And so that shows you that when you can do this at scale, it really makes a difference. ", "But recommendations, for example, we just made a change to how we handle recommendations, where we have readers, the readers go through \u2014 we make sure they\u2019re representative from all parts of the US, we publish the guidelines \u2014 those readers then identify a set of videos that they think are, could be, they might technically meet the requirements of following our community guidelines, but they\u2019re close. And there\u2019s a lot of content that, there\u2019s 1 percent that brushes up against the community guidelines. So what we do is we identify this with, a set of them, with humans, and then we use machines and machine learning to expand, and based on that then we are basically very unlikely to recommend that.", "I\u2019ll get to recommendations, I have a personal beef with you about that.", "Okay. I can\u2019t wait to hear.", "My son, who is 13 years old, started watching Ben Shapiro videos. And he\u2019s like the gateway drug to the next group. And then it goes right to Jordan Peterson, then it goes down and in three clicks he was in Neo-Nazi stuff. It was astonishing. And then I had to listen to it at dinner. And I was sort of like, \u201cI\u2019m going to kill Susan Wojcicki first.\u201d", "Okay. Here I am.", "But it was sort of like, I was sort of like, it feels like, as I said, I think you\u2019ve heard me say this, it feels like all you tech companies have built cities, these beautiful cities, but you decided not to initially put in police, fire, garbage, street signs, and stuff like that, and so it feels like ", "The Purge", " every night. It\u2019s a good joke, but it is, I\u2019m sort of like, and then I\u2019ve got this kid who\u2019s like, \u201cWell Ben Shapiro\u2019s sort of smart.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cNo he\u2019s not! Not even slightly! He\u2019s clever but he\u2019s an idiot.\u201d", "Anyway, it\u2019s just exhausting. But it has a huge effect on him. Do you feel like the people, on a bigger thing \u2014 and it\u2019s not your total responsibility, Susan \u2014 but do you feel like the people in Silicon Valley have a sense of this, of the impact they have, and are capable of dealing with it? Or will regulatory measures just have to come into place? Because it\u2019s already starting in Europe, it\u2019s starting in California here with privacy bills, do you feel like you\u2019re all able to do that?", "We have already made a huge difference, and we will continue. And that will have a big impact on how our platforms work. And we actually use this analogy of a city too, where we feel that we were initially starting out as a smaller city, and people kind of all knew each other on the internet, and then very quickly, we grew to this major metropolitan city. And our goal is, we\u2019ve really ramped up, Google has committed to having 10,000 people committed to dealing with controversial content, which we staffed last year. We have tightened our guidelines, we have made very significant changes in how we handle our policies, like the recommendations. ", "So getting to your son ...", "He\u2019s lost.", "No, we can work on your son here, I have a son too and I get some of these discussions also at the dinner table. I think what you\u2019re describing is \u2014 and the way we think about it, too \u2014 look, there\u2019s a set of content that has to meet the community guidelines. Ben Shapiro is going to meet the community guidelines. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re suggesting that we remove him from the platform. Are you?", "I would, but I can\u2019t. No, no.", "Okay.", "You know, last time I saw you, I was like, \u201cGet Alex Jones off that platform,\u201d and you\u2019re like, \u201cWell the community guidelines,\u201d and then you got him off.", "No, he\u2019s not on the platform.", "So I was right, but ...", "It was the terms of service, actually.", "I was the terms of service. He broke the terms of service.", "He broke our terms of service, yes.", "But what I mean is, I\u2019m getting to the larger picture, and then I do want to get to issues around diversity and other things.", "Sure.", "Do you feel like you all have the capabilities? Because it sometimes feels like, again, it\u2019s a small group of people that\u2019s deciding on a large ... is there enough diversity, is there ... within your management structure to do that, to make these decisions?", "Well, diversity is a huge and important part of YouTube, and that\u2019s what I love about YouTube is the fact that we\u2019ve been able to tell so many stories. And that\u2019s why in many ways we want to make sure that we\u2019re protecting the freedom of speech but also enforcing the community guidelines at the same time. And I do think we\u2019ll make very significant progress. I think we have made significant progress, and we will continue to do that.", "I\u2019m talking about in your management structure, do you feel like, you all live in a zip code of Palo Alto or whatever, do you feel like there\u2019s ...", "No, actually half of YouTube lives in San Francisco.", "Well, that\u2019s good.", "Yes.", "But do you feel like there\u2019s been enough ... I mean, for a long while, Susan, it was you and Sheryl [Sandberg] that were it.", "Yeah. Well, so actually I just ran some stats before we ...", "That\u2019s just women. I\u2019m not talking about people of color and different ages and ...", "Sure. I think it\u2019s incredibly important. I just looked at my management team, and I\u2019ve been really focused on diversity at YouTube and bringing more leaders and more women and more people of color and underrepresented minorities to YouTube, I 100 percent agree this is essential. And I\u2019m saying it from many perspectives. I think it\u2019s important from a business perspective, because to have that point of view of representing everyone and understanding, and drawing the best talent.", "I just looked at my management team. So when I got there, the number of directors at YouTube was about 15 percent in terms of women. Now, it is double, around 30 percent. So I\u2019m not saying that we\u2019re at 50 percent, which like, women are 50 percent of the population, but in my leadership, that number has doubled.", "What about the rest of the ...", "But how do you press that at the rest of Google, because here you are doing this, and I want to also get to people of color, and ...", "Well, YouTube is going to keep growing.", "Right.", "So my goal is, I think YouTube is a company within Google, and so the goal for me is to think about how do I, and I have control of YouTube as a CEO, so my goal is let\u2019s make YouTube really diverse, and show what it is to have a diverse tech company, and then deploy different techniques, whether it\u2019s bringing in people who are supporting underrepresented communities, increasing our recruiting at colleges we might not have gone to beforehand, just making sure that it is a really inclusive place and the people that are there feel supported. And that also leaves a pathway for other tech companies, it leaves a pathway for Google, etc.", "Now you\u2019ve been around a long time, do you think it\u2019s changed a lot? Because it doesn\u2019t feel like it has. I mean, let\u2019s be honest.", "I think it has changed.", "How?", "Actually I think you\u2019ve been helpful in changing it.", "Yes, I know that, but I ... I can only say, \u201cYou fucking assholes\u201d so many times before it loses ...", "That\u2019s helpful.", "It\u2019s helpful, but at some time, do you imagine it shifting? Because whenever I feel like it has, it feels like I see the same group of people. And want happens is, I think for example at Facebook, so I\u2019ll use another company, because I think you\u2019re a more obstreperous group at Google, the cohesion within the group at Facebook led directly to what has happened there. They always ragged about getting along, and I was like, \u201cWell, who\u2019s the pain in the ass here?\u201d and they did say, \u201cYou, Kara,\u201d but I don\u2019t work there, and I\u2019m not a billionaire either. So what has to change within tech to do that?", "Well, I wrote this Vanity Fair piece called, \u201cBreaking up the Silicon Valley Boys Club.\u201d And the first point I made was, it needs to come from the CEO level. And I\u2019ve really seen, the CEO has to make it a priority. They have to say, \u201cThis really matters, I\u2019m going to give it the resources, I\u2019m going to meet with the underrepresented groups, I\u2019m going to focus on having a diverse management team.\u201d ", "I realize I\u2019ve been at Google for 20 years, right? And so, I think when I first started, if I compare it to now in today\u2019s world, I think, A) there\u2019s much more focus on how diversity really matters from a business standpoint, I think the technology is more diverse, like we see it reaching more people, and I also think the culture of any kind of discrimination or sexism, people are much more aware of that and much less willing to tolerate it, I think on both sides, both men, women, leadership, and employees. I think part of that has been, sadly, we\u2019ve had #MeToo and all these different examples of companies that have not done a good job, and that has been really ...", "Including Google", ". ", "Yes, including Google. But I\u2019ll say the positive ... Although these were very negative events, and I\u2019m so sad when I see that they happen, but the positive is it\u2019s raised awareness of how companies cannot operate this and the consequences if they do. That is really important, to bring awareness that this is just not acceptable behavior in Silicon Valley.", "All right. We\u2019re going to finish up talking about ... I don\u2019t have a timer here so I don\u2019t know the minutes, but if someone has ... There\u2019s no timer here so I can just keep going on. Two things I want to talk about, disinformation and regulation and the Google walkout. These are three things I want to get to.", "Okay. Okay, great. ", "So the Google walkout, there\u2019s people here ... ", "I did a great podcast with a bunch of them", ". How did you see that within Google among the top ... You\u2019re on the top management team at Google. You\u2019ve just ended forced arbitration, correct?", "Yes. Yes.", "How did you look at that? Do you think ...", "First of all ...", "How many people here are from Google that were part of that? Do you all realize it\u2019s a bigger deal or you were like, \u201cIt\u2019s just some noisy employees?\u201d", "No, no. It was a big deal. It was a big deal. First of all, seeing the news was really upsetting. I think that was the sentiment of the entire management team, that it was really upsetting. The way I approach things is, \u201cHow can we make things better?\u201d What I appreciate about Google is that we saw that people said, \u201cI want to make this a better company. I\u2019m upset. I want to go. I want to make change. I\u2019m asking for change.\u201d That means that it\u2019s a company that people care about and that they want to make it a better place. So as a management team, we wanted to give people the leeway to tell their stories, to hear what wasn\u2019t going well. We said, \u201cSure, if people want to go to the walkout, they should go to the walkout, and we\u2019re going to listen to the stories, and we\u2019re going to listen about how we can do better.\u201d", "I don\u2019t want to say that everything is solved. It\u2019s not. Right? There\u2019s always going to be more to do. But if you look at the changes that we made really quickly, there were a lot of changes that were made quickly. The changes were, first of all, we started with not having forced arbitration around sexual harassment. That was the first change. We revamped the process of how it\u2019s reported. I think people told their stories. And even though we had a process, we realized that process can be better and we made different changes there. We said we would report on it. We said, \u201cLet\u2019s have mandatory training.\u201d We renewed our commitment to diversity. And there\u2019s more. There\u2019s ongoing work. ", "All right. Will you all, do you think, do you imagine, I know you\u2019re not the person in charge of this, put an employee on the board of Google?", "Yeah, so I\u2019m not the person in charge of this. ", "Will you advocate for it? Do you think it\u2019s a good idea?", "Eh, I mean, I don\u2019t know enough. I have never been on a board where there\u2019s a employee.", "No, it\u2019s all white guys. I know.", "No, there\u2019s diversity.", "Your board is pretty good. Your board is ...", "Our board is pretty good. I\u2019m also on the board of Salesforce and I think they have really good diversity there. That\u2019s been great to see and great to see that commitment. So I don\u2019t know. I mean, I\u2019m not on the board and ...", "What do you think about the idea of an employee on the board?", "Well, it depends who the employee is, right? I mean, I\u2019m an employee. I think it matters who the employee is. I think it\u2019s to make ... I mean, boards usually review plans. They don\u2019t necessarily come up with a plan to be able to make that change. So I think having focus at the Google level, at the Alphabet level, and as the team has currently been doing, is probably the right place to be able to be able to make a lot of change. I don\u2019t want to say there aren\u2019t benefits of having employee ... I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never been on a board with an employee, so I don\u2019t ... I just don\u2019t know enough about that. ", "The last thing \u2014 I\u2019m not going to be able to get to privacy because I\u2019ve got a short amount of time \u2014 is contractors.

We have temps, contractors, and vendors, TVCs.", "Should they be treated the same way and not be these sort of second-class citizens of Silicon Valley? It\u2019s increasing in employment, not just at Google, but everywhere. ", "Yeah, yeah. Yeah. First of all, the company, and many companies in Silicon Valley, need to employ TVCs to be able to scale and to be able to ramp up to an expertise that the company itself may not have. Right? That could be anything from the bus drivers and people who are, I don\u2019t know, working across security ...", "Yeah, and...", "... or are lawyers who are advising us on very complicated areas where we don\u2019t have full expertise. It\u2019s a broad range of expertise that we have there. ", "We do have a supplier code of conduct. We want to make sure that all of the suppliers are implementing and treating the people that we employ, and that when we do employ them, that they meet a certain level in terms of our supplier code of conduct. I think that is a really important leverage point to make sure that that causes them as a vendor to make sure that they\u2019re meeting those right requirements, to make sure that the TVCs, the temps, vendors, and contractors that we\u2019re hiring, are getting fair and great working conditions. ", "All right. Do you believe Silicon Valley, this is the year of reckoning? This is my last question. This sort of has been a year of reckoning. Do you feel like the leaders get it? You know, I\u2019ve always said to you, and I think you agree with me, that Silicon Valley has always been a mirror-tocracy rather than meritocracy. Do you believe they get it, that perhaps they did not hang the moon and they really do have to make these serious changes? Do you think that, since you\u2019re at the very top of it?", "I think they get it. I mean, it\u2019s been a year where we have been ... I think any good leader needs to step back and say, \u201cHow can we do this better?\u201d There was a period of time where I ... I\u2019d say maybe this was two years ago, where we just said, \u201cLook, something has to change here and we have to make a change.\u201d I went to my team and we said, \u201cLook in our what we call trust and safety area and how we handle this from a product standpoint.

You have to come back, wherever you are in the world. You need to be there. You need to be on it. We\u2019ve been working around the clock to solve these issues. I\u2019m not saying we\u2019re done.

And as I look back at my time in the Senate, I know a few things. I know that I can be tough on people, sometimes too tough. That I can push them too hard. That I can always do better.

And I couldn\u2019t have done that without staff. And we\u2019ve also had so many people that have gone on to do incredible things.

I was kind of right out with my candidacy, I thought that was really important. If you haven\u2019t noticed, I have a little less name ID than a few of the other candidates and maybe that was why I was right out there right away. But whatever it is, I just can\u2019t waste my time analyzing it because these stakes are too high and I care too much. That\u2019s why I announced my candidacy in the middle of a blizzard by that Mississippi River, because I wanted to make the point that it is time to cross the river of our divides, to stop spending every day looking at the latest tweet and the latest attack and walk over that sturdy bridge that is our democracy to a new plateau in our politics, to a new ground in our politics. ", "And to me, which is why it\u2019s so cool we\u2019re here in Austin, is to take on the challenges that are before us. Because this is a city that has taken on challenges that has walked right into the digital world and developed new businesses and new ideas, that is on the cutting edge when it comes to culture and music and understands that America isn\u2019t just on the coasts, right? That America, just like Minnesota, is in the heartland of this country and in the heart of Texas. ", "Well, okay, Austin\u2019s really nice, the barbecue\u2019s great. But I want to understand, though, why ... When these things do degenerate, because it is part of the broader culture now, how stories pop up like this, they go through their cycles, there\u2019s been dozens of them for each of the candidates. What does that say about our political culture now? Because it is a twitchy culture, we have a person who\u2019s running this country who I think is probably the most epic troller of all time on Twitter. ", "He called me Snow Woman.", "Yes.", "I liked that name, actually. I embraced it.", "It could have gone so many other ways. How do you imagine that to be? I mean, you say that, we want to cross the digital divide, we want to get along. Can\u2019t we all get ... But life is not a Coca-Cola commercial.", "It\u2019s not just can we get along, no, no, no. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re all gonna get along. I think what we think we can do is have in the words of my friend, John McCain, the last thing he did when I saw him alive on his ranch was to point to some words in his book, which said, \u201cThere is nothing more liberating than fighting for a cause larger than yourself.\u201d", "Mm-hmm.", "Well, America is that cause right now and when I see the corrosive divide, instead of trying to find ways to bring us together in times of crisis, he finds ways to bring us apart. This is Donald Trump. Every single day. And so that is the No. 1 thing on people\u2019s mind. ", "The second one is to make sure we have someone in the White House that is willing to rise to the challenges of the day, whether they\u2019re climate change, whether there\u2019s how we handle privacy legislation, immigration reform, something so important in Texas, so important for our economy, something that he doesn\u2019t talk about enough. How we handle income inequality. These are the challenges of our day. And because we are spending all of our time being governed by chaos, he is not governing by opportunity and I want to govern with opportunity. ", "When you think about doing that, what is your path to winning in that way? How do you look at your path? Because first of all, there\u2019s the money path, the raising of the inordinate amounts of money. There\u2019s the noise of social media, there\u2019s the divide, what is your path? Lay it out for us.", "Well, I start with how I have won every single election that I\u2019ve ever run in. And that is by going not just where it\u2019s comfortable, but where it\u2019s uncomfortable. Texas is a great example here, by the way. Look at those congressional races you won in this state, right? That people did not expect that you could win. And if you didn\u2019t have candidates that came up and ran in areas that were unexpected, we wouldn\u2019t have those seats. So that\u2019s what I\u2019ve done in my own state. And I have won in three U.S. Senate elections, every single congressional district, every single time \u2014 including Michelle Bachman\u2019s, okay? That is in a purple state and that is in a state that Donald Trump nearly won, which includes winning, he won a bunch of rural counties that I then went on to win two years later. ", "And that is because I think when you talk to people in rural areas, you quickly find out that rural poverty for kids is just as bad as it can be in urban areas. You quickly find out that they feel like there are people in urban areas that think that their food just lands on their plate and don\u2019t understand the hard work that goes into it. So there are rural hospital issues that are so unique. There are rural broadband issues. And that\u2019s why as president, one of the things, as we talk about tech here, which I think should unite our country is that yes, we can be as good as Iceland, okay, we can get ...", "Is that your campaign slogan? \u201cYes, we could be as good as Iceland?\u201d", "I don\u2019t think that would really work in the warmer parts of the United States, but the idea is that we should be able to get rural broadband out to every household, broadband, by 2022. There is no reason that we can\u2019t do that. ", "But your platform, the key platform that you talked about when you were in the snow: Pharma prices, tech, what else?", "I talked about the idea that we need to have people\u2019s back, that everyone matters in this country. And for too long, yes, we want to move to universal health care, and I have ideas for that, but the pharma issue has been neglected really under any administration in the last 20 years. They actually think they own Washington. Well, they don\u2019t own me. From the very beginning since the day I got there, I have led bills that have been focused on bring pharmaceutical prices down. To me, that means more competition. In Minnesota, we can see Canada from our porch and that means we see these less-expensive drugs all the time. ", "So if you were to bring in safer drugs from places like Canada, that\u2019s a bill I had with Senator McCain and now Senator Grassley has agreed to take his place, you could bring down prices. If you stopped the pernicious policy called Pay for Delay, where big pharma pays off generics to keep their products off the market, think about how anti-competitive that is, you save $2.9 billion for customers in just a few years. Medicare, allow to unleash that bargaining power of 43 million seniors and lift the ban on negotiating prices. Those are all pro-consumer issues. Those are all ways to deal with competition and to bring back what I think is a strong system, the capitalist system. ", "But you\u2019re not gonna have entrepreneurship like we\u2019re seeing in this town if you allow big companies to buy out other companies and to completely dominate a marketplace. Then you lose competition. It was Adam Smith that said, as much as he loved capitalism, he said that he fears that power of monopolies. Well, that\u2019s what\u2019s happening right now. ", "You said pharma doesn\u2019t own you but it owns Washington. How do you then do anything about it?", "Well, because it\u2019s starting to be such a big political issue that politicians get scared, right? So politicians get scared when there\u2019s a crisis, like when we had the financial crisis and then we had to act. Well you don\u2019t want to wait until you get to that moment of a crisis. But right now, the voters clearly said we don\u2019t like what\u2019s happening when it comes pharma prices. Ads were run on it, people who had been too much in their pockets were in trouble and it was used against them. So you\u2019re reaching this pinnacle of a political moment where you could actually get action and you\u2019ve got to seize that moment and that moment is now and that moment will be when I\u2019m president of the United States. ", "When you think about this idea of large companies, we\u2019re gonna get to tech in a minute. One of the things that you are also doing is sort of the idea of you\u2019re in the middle, you\u2019re in the middle of the country, you have a more, some people think is too compromised. There\u2019s a lot of pull to the left in the Democratic party. Talk a little bit about that issue, because I think it\u2019s hard to resist what\u2019s happening within the Democratic party itself. ", "What I see as a real election model, and that was 2018, when yes, there\u2019s differences in our Party, I think that\u2019s healthy that we\u2019re not all in lock step. And we certainly are at a moment in time when we need new ideas in our party. So you can have new ideas from the left, from the middle, from the right. But you\u2019ve got to be open to new ideas. And that\u2019s, by the way, how you always get compromise and how you get things done. If you just shut down new ideas, then you\u2019re never gonna get to a different place in our politics. ", "So I saw in 2018 that people united behind candidates. Yes, there were a few well-known primaries, but in the end people united behind the candidates and we elected people like Laura Kelly in Kansas, Democratic governor who beat Kris Kobach that people didn\u2019t think was possible. In my neighboring state of Wisconsin, we elected a new governor who beat Scott Walker, that happened, and we also elected some exciting new liberal candidates to Congress all over the country. So we have people of all different stripes. The important thing is we realized that there was a cause greater than ourselves, whatever our individual differences are, and put some new people in who now can be that check and balance on the Trump administration.", "So when you have a campaign, and the Trump campaign is gonna be sort of scorched Earth, it looks like it from this ...", "Really?", "Yes, I know, shocking. How do you then push back against that? As a compromise candidate, \u201cI\u2019m gonna be reasonable.\u201d You tried to do that in the Kavanaugh hearings, you kept your ... when he was yelling at you about beer.", "I kept my cool. I wasn\u2019t gonna go down into that swamp with him, no.", "Right. Do you have to possibly go down into that swamp, even though there you ...", "You have to pick your moments. And I would say one of the things that we learned out of 2016 \u2014 and Hillary Clinton would have been a great president, she had great ideas, she had a great policy platform \u2014 but no one had run against someone like Trump before, so this is across the board, not just her campaign, everyone didn\u2019t know what to do. And it seemed to me that by going down every rabbit hole, that we lost our optimistic economic agenda for America that we regained. We had cases to make in 2018 that were really important. Don\u2019t kick people off their health insurance for pre-existing conditions. So part of this is staying on the issues that matter to you and making sure that he doesn\u2019t mess around with you. ", "The second thing is, you pick your battles with him, right? You don\u2019t go after every single tweet he does. When he called me the Snow Woman, I thought, \u201cWell, this isn\u2019t bad,\u201d so let it sit out there for a while and then I finally said ... something I will do effectively is use humor. I finally said, \u201cYou know what, I\u2019d like to see how your hair would fair in a blizzard,\u201d Mr. Umbrella Man. So I think you have to ...", "Is that your nickname for him, Mr. Umbrella Man?", "No, I just made that up right now, no, it\u2019s not really, it\u2019s not like a focused-group moment.", "I\u2019ve got some others. ", "I think that you have to pick your moments, you have to use humor, and you have to have a different approach to him than we\u2019ve had before. But when he says things that are racist, when he says things that are anti-immigrant, that are meant to foment hate, yes you call him on it but you never lose track of your goal, which is to bring this country together. ", "So in doing that, because a lot of people do the tit for tat with him and they get drawn into his agenda. I think that\u2019s absolutely right that you get ...", "Oh, he wants to get on every news cycle when you have something rolling, like you decided to announce in the middle of a permanent snow globe, then he wants to get in there. So you have to decide how are you gonna deal with it that moment. ", "What did you learn? You were talking about the sort of going down every rabbit hole in the Clinton campaign, what did you learn from that as you studied that?", "Well, I learned that being in a Midwestern heartland state, I learned that there were people \u2014 and Hillary was strong on the farm bill and things like that \u2014 but I learned that there were people that weren\u2019t hearing that. That they felt left out. That they felt our party, not just her, was not speaking for them. And that is why I\u2019ve always had this mantra, that you go where it\u2019s not just comfortable, you go where it\u2019s uncomfortable. You meet people where they are and you listen to them and you don\u2019t always agree with them, you stand your ground but you have got to hear them out. ", "So in that sort of middle position, which I think, would you call yourself ...", "By the way, could I use one example? Like guns, okay. I come from a prosecutor background, I\u2019ve always believed that you have to have sensible gun safety legislation. I know we\u2019re in Texas right now, which isn\u2019t that different than Minnesota when it comes to hunting. So I look at every single proposal in front of me \u2014 and I have an F rating from the NRA, let me make this clear. I look at every single proposal before me and I say, \u201cDoes this hurt my Uncle Dick in the deerskin, okay?\u201d And when I met your son with his Cabela\u2019s shirt telling me that he had shot a boar, that was cool, I started talking to him about that because that\u2019s what I look at. ", "And then I point out that the vast majority of Americans and even many, many gun owners believe that we can have universal background checks, right? So you have to make the argument, which doesn\u2019t diss all of hunting, a quality of life issue for my people in my state but makes the safety argument. Because I sat across from Donald Trump and literally took track, nine times at that gun meeting we had, I was there because I was leading the gun safety legislation. The school safety legislation with Senator Hatch and also had a domestic violence bill. Nine times he said he wanted universal background checks. And the next day, he met with the gun lobby and never got it done.", "Right. ", "That\u2019s wrong.", "Right. All right. So one of the ideas is getting, being in the centrists. With Biden entering the picture, and I hear Sherrod Brown coming out, how do you, he\u2019s more of that kind of candidate, like you\u2019re more of a centrist. How do you manage, you know, the 412 people running for the Democratic party?", "I\u2019m sorry, Kara, that\u2019s a bit of an exaggeration. ", "OK, 312.", "There are a number of great candidates, no, there really are. And I always like to jokingly say, may the best woman win. But no litmus test, many of them would be good. But I think that competition is good. Barack Obama has told this to people, maybe not publicly, but I\u2019ve heard he\u2019s told a lot of people ...", "Did you have one of those meeting with him? ", "Yes, I did.", "Okay.", "He was in a really good mood.", "All right, okay.", "He\u2019s really happy, and \u2026", "... well, why not?", "he was really happy about Michelle\u2019s book tour and how well she\u2019s doing and how she\u2019s filling stadiums and that this is her moment. And it was just really quite beautiful to hear him talk about it. ", "But I think that he has always said that competition is good. And I believe that, that you need a competition of ideas, especially now when we\u2019ve been so stultified by not moving forward on the challenges in front of us, and also that you want to hear different voices, and from different people in the country, and I am proud to be a heartland candidate; I think you want to hear from the Midwest. ", "All right, in that thing, the idea that why should you, this is a question I got from Twitter, why should we elect a candidate who says, no, that\u2019s not possible, to do everything progressives want?", "Because I\u2019m being honest, and I think you want honesty. And you can have legitimate differences on how you get places. You know, I want to get to universal health care, and I want to do it with a public option; I think you could do that immediately, that was something that Barack Obama wanted to do with the Affordable Care Act, by expanding Medicaid or expanding Medicare. ", "I think that we need to move quickly on climate change, which is really the challenge of our time. When you look at the rising sea levels, when you watch that video of that dad driving his young daughter and singing songs to her through that lapping wildfire in northern California, and you think of people watching that and realizing that could happen to me. These are things are going on all over our country right now. And that\u2019s why as president, I would rejoin the International Climate Change Agreement on day one, bring back the Clean Power Rules, bring back the gas mileage standards, introduce legislation to finally do something on building codes. This is the challenge of our day.", "All right, that\u2019s rolling back what they rolled back. What about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Green New Deal? She\u2019s here looking for tacos right now, apparently, according to the internets. How do you look at that? Because that\u2019s quite ...", "Yeah, I\u2019m a co-sponsor of that, it is a resolution, and I liked to get on that, not because I thought we could get everything done in 10 years, but because I thought that it harnessed this energy right now to say, let\u2019s stop admiring this problem and do something about it, right? That\u2019s what that is.

But they know we have to do something. ", "The debate on whether it\u2019s happening is over, the debate on how we handle it and how quickly we respond and whether we\u2019re gonna be alone against the rest of the world or we\u2019re with the rest of the world is happening now. ", "But that\u2019s precisely what they\u2019re doing, they\u2019re attacking Ocasio-Cortez personally, which they\u2019re doing a lot; she\u2019s become their favorite. It\u2019s not working particularly well, but ...", "No, not very well. She\u2019s good at responding.", "Yeah, but they are doing that right now around the billionaire stuff, around the taxing, around the Green New Deal, around a lot of these issues.", "Yeah, that\u2019s what they do, but my point is, America is on our side. And we need to, just as we did in 2018, we need to unite. There\u2019s gonna be some differences on the policies and how you get there.

So, I want to finish up with this presidential thing. What\u2019s the topic ...", "Yeah, let\u2019s just finish it ...", "Yeah, no, president. No, I\u2019m gonna get to tech, I wanna talk about tech.", "Yeah, we got to.

Let\u2019s see, I want to avoid constant attacks on what label are you, where do you, how are you different? And I want us to in a really good way, and maybe this is a Pollyanna, just be able to discuss policy differences. I\u2019m looking forward to those debates. ", "And the gotcha every single day on things that are differentiating people, or something they said about each other, I think it\u2019s gonna be one of the hazards that we\u2019re gonna have to deal with. Because you get asked every day, \u201cWell, what do you think about this person\u2019s policy?\u201d And then you say, \u201cWell, I agree with this part, but not that part.\u201d Or, \u201cI agree with this,\u201d and then that can be exploded into, \u201cOh, they hate each other.\u201d", "You know, I just hope we can get beyond that as a nation. There was times in our country, we mentioned antitrust, where we had big debates about big issues, and that\u2019s what we need to do right now, and I have faith in my colleagues who are running for office that we\u2019ll be able to do that well.", "All right, so reasonableness is what you\u2019re looking for?", "Reasonableness in how we treat each other, because we have one goal, and that is to win the White House.", "Let\u2019s get to tech. You introduced a bill last year on social media privacy, you did The Honest Ads Act, all kinds of things. Three days ago, you talked about re-upping the investigation, the FTC investigation into Google\u2019s dominance in search. Not many people heard that, I did, I heard when you said it, but then Elizabeth Warren came out with this astonishing proposal, and I think most people in tech are sort of vomiting in their Allbirds.", "That\u2019s really appealing!", "Yeah, I know, it\u2019s not. They\u2019re gonna get someone to clean them, so they, it really went far, kind of thing. Talk first about the Elizabeth Warren proposal, and then talk a little bit about your issues around Big Tech.", "Well, you know, there is merit in \u2014 and I want to look at the whole proposal \u2014 in the fact that she\u2019s talking about that you have to look at the anti-competitive aspects of this. We all know that. And the way that I have approached it is this way. No. 1, privacy. For so long, these companies have said, \u201cWe\u2019ve got your backs.\u201d Well, that\u2019s just not true. ", "And they\u2019ve somehow equated a free and open internet, which we all support, net neutrality, this idea that you should be able to, everyone should have access to it, that\u2019s true, but that doesn\u2019t mean that we just say, \u201cOkay, so just take all my data and I trust you. I\u2019m a commodity to you; you make money off of me.\u201d So the first thing we do is privacy legislation; I have a bipartisan bill to do that with notice of breach and those kinds of things. ", "The second thing is to look at the consumer pieces of this, in terms of how much they are making off of us, basically. Because the problem is that we just thought, oh, we can just put our stuff on there and it\u2019s fine. But they\u2019re making money off of us. So one big idea I think we need to discuss, in addition to privacy and making sure that the election ads are out there, is looking at, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m asking this here because I want to get your feedback later, is maybe there\u2019s a way we could actually tax when they use data, when they use us and we\u2019re their commodity, and we\u2019re not getting anything out of it, right? Well maybe then we could tax them, so the money goes back to us, when they are exchanging that data. Right?", "When they sell our data to someone else, well, maybe they\u2019re gonna have to tell us so we can put some kind of a tax on it, just like we do with other businesses. If you go on a truck, if you send stuff on rail, you have to pay for the roads and you have to pay for the rail, and maybe there\u2019s some way we can do that with large sets of data. When they use it or when they sell it. That is one idea that I want to put out there today. ", "Otherwise, we\u2019re just being used, right? And this isn\u2019t about taxing ourselves, it\u2019s about doing this in a way that wouldn\u2019t limit innovation, maybe you would do it with larger platforms, not startups, maybe there\u2019s some way. But we should be looking at something like that, because these days that we think that they can just make money off of us, and we don\u2019t get anything out of it, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right. ", "And then the last thing I would add, which you know about, is just antitrust laws, which go way beyond tech. And those are my ideas to supercharge the agencies, and this would get at some of the stuff Elizabeth\u2019s trying to get at in a different way, which is to give them the resources; by putting a fee on the mega deals. This is not on consumers, this is on the big companies that are merging, sometimes billion dollar, trillion dollar companies. So that they have to pay more so that then that is used to fund FTC, Justice Department, so they can be more on an even playing field, and as sophisticated as the tycoons that are making these deals. ", "That will allow them to do the \u2014 thank you, one person. That will allow them to do the investigation so they can better look at what\u2019s going on, so you can look at what happened when they did the AT&T breakup, right? That was a big thing, but costs went down for long distance. We\u2019re trying to replicate that in a much more complicated, sophisticated scenario. ", "And the last thing would be to change the standard. So on the big deals, that they have the burden to show, the companies have the burden to show in a merger that they do not materially reduce, I would change the standard, materially reduce competition. ", "Because otherwise you\u2019ve got, you know, Google Maps buys Waze, and I don\u2019t think most consumers know that, right? Well, they bought Waze. So we all love Waze, super cool, right? Well, now they own it. All right? And you have these things going on, online travel, when you go to all those sites to get a deal, 93 percent of them are owned by two companies. They have different names, but they\u2019re all owned by the same companies. This is what brought Teddy Roosevelt into the White House, right? He ran on breaking up the trusts, and making sure that he preserved a capitalist system. Woodrow Wilson actually had an antitrust campaign song. ", "Can you sing it?", "No one laughed, so sad. But actually it\u2019s true, because people saw this as a way of guaranteeing competition, lowering prices, and increasing innovation.", "All right. So antitrust, the idea of changing antitrust first, let\u2019s talk about specific companies. Should Facebook or Google be broken up? And how? ", "If they are at a point where you have, there\u2019s competition ...", "I\u2019m asking ", "you", ", are they? ", "I would want to have it investigated; that is how I do things, okay? I don\u2019t just come in and say ...", "Well, there\u2019s been a lot of, there was investigations.", "No, no, no. I would think that you go in there, and we have just not had adequate investigation, which is why I called for that from the FTC; you go in there, and you figure out what are the anti-competitive, the major anti-competitive problems, and then you come up with a plan to break up or to move something out. If there\u2019s a piece of it that is anti-competitive. ", "The other way you could do it, especially under the bill that I just introduced, you can strengthen, and I\u2019m going to introduce a third one, you can strengthen the review going backwards after a merger has occurred. And one of the things I\u2019m worried about with the potential that you\u2019re gonna integrate Facebook and Instagram and WhatsApp, is that then it\u2019s gonna be impossible to untangle it.", "That\u2019s why they did it.", "To use the antitrust laws to do it. So that\u2019s another argument for ...", "You realize, that\u2019s why they did it. That\u2019s one of the reasons.", "Exactly. So that is why I think you have to have adequately funded government agencies with a president in charge who just doesn\u2019t ", "use antitrust as a weapon", ", right? \u201cOh, I don\u2019t like CNN, so let me get involved.\u201d Really bad. Instead, you see it as one of the governing principles for ensuring that we have a capitalist system. And that is, we don\u2019t have all this monopoly consolidation that\u2019s squeezing out new competitors and new market entrants.", "All right, so antitrust regulation; it also has to change the idea of antitrust, correct? The house subcommittee just hired Lina Khan, who has some new ideas about antitrust; you were a lawyer. How does that ... because competitive harm is hard to prove here, everybody ", "loves", " Amazon, they deliver on time, and they\u2019re never wrong, like that kind of, like everybody likes it. ", "Oh, you\u2019re saying this to the home state of Target?", "I understand that.", "Which, by the way, went up last year because they started some innovative things, like you can go and pick your stuff up right in the parking lot, to give a little ...", "Yeah, but they, look, they missed a lot of turns; a lot of retailers missed a lot of these turns, but here you have the idea of consumer harm.", "By the way, you want competition, right? You want this innovation that Amazon brought into the market. You just don\u2019t want them controlling everything under them, that\u2019s a monopsony. Whole Foods is another example of that. You want to have the ability of a government that\u2019s a countermeasure to go in and investigate and figure out, hey, is this one so bad for competition, and shutting things out like we did in the long distance market, like they did back over a century ago with ...", "Or Microsoft.", "Rail and all kinds of industries, and the Pullman strike in Chicago. You want to be able to have pushback so that you guarantee that you\u2019re not stifling the innovation, but innovation is there. That is always how we have worked in America.", "And sadly, because of conservative courts, that have gone so conservative, including the two new nominees, Kavanaugh and Gorsuch, that are even more conservative on antitrust than who we\u2019ve got there, you\u2019ve got to do something legislatively and through the agencies to change this. ", "How likely do you think that is to happen? The idea of it. Because Republicans have their beefs with tech too, it\u2019s largely around whether ...", "Right. And so by the way, that creates some likeliness, right? That creates likeliness that you can move on antitrust; a number of my colleagues on the Republican side have talked to me about that idea of increasing the fees on the mega mergers, that\u2019s not on the taxpayers\u2019 backs, drop in the bucket for them, so you can beef up the agencies, so they can better do these investigations. That\u2019s something they are open to, we just have to set it at the right price. So I would say that first. ", "I think the public is gonna get more and more aware of this issue because of the presidential debates and what\u2019s happening. I\u2019m coming out with a book on this, actually, on antitrust. I\u2019ve been looking at this for the last two years, and I think that you\u2019re gonna be able to have a better discussion of this, framed in a way around things like pharmaceutical prices, data privacy, that\u2019s gonna make it more bite-sized and more doable for an election.", "All right. Privacy bill. Should be the lowest rung to jump over. Why, there\u2019s a privacy bill in California that\u2019s coming into force, which some people say doesn\u2019t have enough teeth, there\u2019s one in Europe that has a lot of teeth. I\u2019m interviewing Margrethe Vestager tomorrow, who runs the competition bureau at the EU, you have that happening over there. You\u2019ve got California, there\u2019s different state things. But the federal government has not passed a privacy bill ever. ", "No, it\u2019s pathetic; we had a hearing on this, and some of the witnesses were saying, \u201cOh, we hate this patchwork that\u2019s coming up through the states. We hate the industry. We hate the California law.\u201d And I finally said, \u201cYou know what? Why do you think the states are doing that? Because you have lobbied against any federal privacy legislation for years.\u201d ", "And so now the time has come. Senator Kennedy and I have a bill, Kennedy of Louisiana, Republican, that would allow for 72-hour notice of breach, something that Zuckerberg said he was open to when he came before Congress, that would make clear that you have to, that you can opt out of this data sharing, and then also make very clear that it has to be in plain language. So those things would go a long way; there\u2019s other things we can do, but we cannot keep going without privacy legislation.", "But what has been the gatekeeper to having this happen?", "Well, it has been lobbying, and making this ... people are scared that it\u2019s gonna look like they\u2019re regulating the internet, and I think we have, you know, we blew past that when Russia was paying in rubles for ads in our last election. That\u2019s over. We have got to look at ... ", "And one more pitch of the bill that I want to pass the most immediately is the Honest Ads Act. We have 12 Republicans on it now in the House, and it simply says, when you spend a bunch of money on internet ads, like everyone\u2019s doing right now, $1.4 billion in 2016, forecast to go to $3 billion to $4 billion in the next election? You have to have the same rules in place that the other media companies have. Newspaper, radio, TV, they have disclaimers for issue ads and candidate ads that says who pays for them, and then you have to disclose them so the other candidates and the press can see what you\u2019re running.", "One of the funniest arguments that companies used on me, they go, \u201cWell, it\u2019s too hard for us to do that,\u201d to figure out what a federal issue ad is, that\u2019s what the standard is. And I said, \u201cReally? Okay, so my radio station in Thief River Falls, Minnesota, can figure that out, I think that you guys can.\u201d ", "So what has happened since then is that Facebook and Twitter are both now supporting the bill. As you know in the last election, which was helpful, they undertook voluntary measures to put up their own archives, which was very, very helpful. But we need to have the law in place, so that everyone\u2019s doing the same thing and we do not put ourselves at risk of foreign governments again buying ads in our elections.", "Do you trust these tech companies?", "No, no, I don\u2019t; I mean, I like that they are incredibly successful for America. I like that they employ so many people. I like that they brought in new ideas and new innovations, but I don\u2019t like that they\u2019ve been saying \u201ctrust us\u201d for so long, and we did it. ", "I think we have to have, as we\u2019ve always had in this country, we have not always just embraced business and let them run the show. We have said, we love business; we want to have them employ people, this is part of why we\u2019re great as America, but we always have a check and balance. The biggest goal of government in my life, and I said this when I was a newly minted county attorney, was protecting people\u2019s safety. Well, right now, they did not protect our safety. Not the safety or our privacy, not the safety of our national security. ", "And I would also add, our government has to learn a little bit of the Austin way here, okay? We have to upgrade our cybersecurity, right? And one of the things that I put in with Senator Thune of South Dakota, I always work hard to make sure we got bipartisan support on big things like this, the idea is you give people a tour of duty, two years in Washington, from the private sector. And our people then can take a tour of duty with the companies. And it is a way of bringing some high-tech expertise into the government. ", "We\u2019re not like China and Russia, we can\u2019t requisition people and say, \u201cYou\u2019re gonna work in a warehouse for five years.\u201d Okay, we can\u2019t do that because it\u2019s America. But what we can do is create incentives to get the best of the best into our government, and the best of our best in our government to learn in the private sector.", "So that\u2019s been a difficult thing; that still remains very difficult, because they make more money working in other places.", "Yeah, I know, but we found a way to do this in this bill.", "All right, so when we\u2019re talking about the idea of China, one of the things, I did a recent ", "podcast with Mark Zuckerberg", ", and one of his arguments of why we should continue to trust them is that the choice is what\u2019s going on in China, which is essentially a surveillance economy. They\u2019re doing all kinds of things like facial recognition, social scoring, all kinds of things where you can see it going in any country, it\u2019s like an episode of ", "Black Mirror", ". And one of the things, when I talk to tech people, is I said, \u201cImagine your creation is an episode of ", "Black Mirror", ". Then don\u2019t do it.\u201d If it becomes that, like imagine what could happen. Which I think is excellent advice.", "But one of his arguments was, well, China gets to do all these things, and they\u2019re gonna collect more data, have better AI, have better robotics. The government\u2019s running it. And his argument was essentially, \u201cit\u2019s Xi or me.\u201d And I don\u2019t like the choice at all. I don\u2019t like either of them. ", "You know, I like him better than Xi, but it\u2019s kind of a low bar. So when they do make that argument, though, in that argument there\u2019s a very cogent thing, is that tech has been innovative, has created jobs. How do you keep innovation, and at the same time throttle some of this behavior, which is careless at best and malevolent at worst?", "Right. And you\u2019re always going to get those arguments that you are gonna, you know, stop everything from innovation. That\u2019s why I like the idea of doing it through FTC antitrust, moving it and putting some very basic privacy rules in place that will save us from where we are right now. But this idea that we\u2019re just gonna do nothing, which they were saying as recently as a year ago, right? ", "They\u2019re saying it today, but...", "Pre Cambridge Analytica, they\u2019re saying it in different ways. It\u2019s just not right. This is not how our country has been run. I go back to even the colonists in the Boston Tea Party, that was about taxation without representation, but it was about that the colonists didn\u2019t want to have to buy tea and sell their tea to the East India Tea Company, to one monopoly, right? ", "It literally is part of the founding of our country that we wanted to have entrepreneurs. Many of the Pilgrims and others came over here because they didn\u2019t want to have people telling them what they had to do. They had this independent spirit of innovation. That is what we have to call back when we deal with tech in the modern day, that we have to suspend belief and say, \u201cOkay, you guys are really cool and I know what you do is super complicated,\u201d and there\u2019s a bunch of people in Washington that can ask dumb questions and don\u2019t understand what it is. ", "Okay, we understand all that\u2019s going on, but you can\u2019t then say, \u201cWell, let\u2019s disarm and we\u2019re not going to do anything to create a counterbalance.\u201d Small companies, I cannot tell you the number of innovative companies that come to me and say, \u201cThis isn\u2019t right. We want to get into this market.\u201d There\u2019s actually a market outcry and there\u2019s some really smart people that can help us get to the point, including in this town, where we can regain that balance, so we can have these successful companies, but we make sure that we\u2019re opening up the market so that new people can compete.", "I have two more questions on tech. One, should Facebook, Google, Amazon, be allowed to buy anything large at all right now?", "That is where I get very concerned and why I want to put these merger standards in place and why I want to be president because I think we got to look carefully at all of these deals. If you look at them through an analysis that includes the standards that I want to put in place, which will at least look monopsonies, which is, do you control things under you, as one of the standards and also changes that burden, then you\u2019re going to be able to get a much better answer to that question.", "And section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which gives them broad immunity, which has I think led directly to this sloppiness in the platforms in terms of not managing them properly. Should that be changed so that they have some, they remove immunity?", "Right. It is something else that we should definitely look at as we look at how we can create more accountability. That is our goal. We do not want to destroy these companies, right? But what we want to do is to put more accountability in place and we have been failing at that effort, and that\u2019s why we need all of your help to get to a better place.", "Does tech like you? Do you get ...?", "Well, they did not like that, which I thought was so crazy, they did not right out of this part, they complained about the Honest Ads Act. How can you complain about something called the Honest Ads Act? But they did not like that and that really made me mad, honestly. They did not like the privacy legislation I keep trying to push them. I think the fact that I\u2019ve been outspoken makes them not like me.", "However, and by the way, if you haven\u2019t learned in the news, running for president shouldn\u2019t be a likeability contest. But let me tell you what the other thing they ", "did", " like and that is that they employ a very diverse workforce. They like that I\u2019ve been out front since the day I got to the Senate on immigration reform, that I believe that Dreamers should stay in America, that I believe that you should have a path to citizenship for our immigrant workforce and that you should not put these mean-spirited caps on refugees because they have a workforce that is diverse.", "Oh, wait.", "They have also ...", "I\u2019m going to push back on that. They do not have a workforce that is diverse.", "Okay, now then we get to, they don\u2019t have a workforce at the top that is diverse. That is a very good point. Thank you. They have a workforce that they need to come in that is diverse. And they recruit people at levels of their company that is diverse. Thank you for correcting me, but they have a real trouble at the top as we do in many areas of our country. What they want is they want to have employees. They have, I think Apple was telling me they have 300 Dreamers that work there, so that is a true fact. I\u2019m not just talking about social media platforms. ", "They have employees that they want to be able to have and keep, so they\u2019ve appreciated that I\u2019ve been outspoken on that issue. They\u2019ve appreciated that I\u2019ve been outspoken. I head up the Diversifying Tech Caucus with Tim Scott. They\u2019ve appreciated that I\u2019m willing to listen on business ideas and trying to do what we can during the downturn. I was a supporter of President Obama\u2019s stimulus. I was a supporter of being smart and moving on affordable health care. ", "Businesses, not just tech, appreciate that I\u2019m willing to take on farmer prices, that is not a left versus right issue. All businesses care about that because it\u2019s an expense of doing business that shouldn\u2019t be that expensive. I have worked with businesses extensively, but I don\u2019t think that means that you have to suck up to them every step of the way.", "Yeah. They do have a lot of money and you are running for president in case you ... You know, you need a lot of money to do that.", "But I\u2019m not taking corporate PAC money.", "All right. That\u2019s just in the news stuff. We\u2019ll finish up, we have 15 more minutes. Manafort handed a 47-month sentence, well below federal guidelines of 19 to 24 years. Your reaction?", "That was appalling to me. I had a job where I was the chief prosecutor for the biggest county in our state. I had about 400 people that worked for me. We would try every day ... We had sentencing guidelines. Minnesota notoriously and I remember looking at what Austin was doing in Travis County at the time, also was doing a lot with working with the communities. This is years and years ago. ", "We worked really hard to use drug courts a lot and to try to be fair in our sentencing. We were not perfect. I tried to do things to improve things, but one of the things that I realized was that we weren\u2019t doing enough with white-collar cases and that crimes in the boardroom were not being treated as seriously as crimes on the street corner, that you could go out and create a crime with the computer that cost people millions of dollars and you got a lesser sentence than you did if you broke into someone\u2019s house with a crowbar. And that\u2019s wrong. ", "When I saw that Manafort sentence that day, I did my tweet on the couch and I was watching. I just thought, \u201cWow,\u201d because he deviated from those sentences and then sentencing guidelines and then added to putting salt on the wound by saying, the judge said about Manafort, \u201cHe led a blameless life until then,\u201d and that just wasn\u2019t true. ", "Let me just, my reaction to this. When we took on white-collar crime, I get to one story here, one of my big cases was a judge that we put in jail. He had stolen hundreds of thousands of dollars from a disabled woman, a woman that literally in her adult years lived in a world of dolls and toys and he had taken over this, basically, a trust for her from his client who had died and then he became a judge and they let him keep doing it. ", "What he was doing was putting on the trust document that he was buying things like a bed for her and he was buying fancy artwork for his house. He was a judge on the second-biggest court in Minnesota. And when we took the case on, literally no one believed it. We did all this investigation, we had to do a search warrant on his chambers. Anyway, we had him cold on the evidence. ", "And then there was the sentencing. And we asked for the guideline sentence which I think it was three or four years for that crime at the time. I was in the courtroom and it was filled with all his friends from his church, from his courtroom, and there was no one there to make that case for justice. And we had no idea what the judge was going to do. ", "All of a sudden, in the middle of this day-long sentencing hearing where literally, the former Miss America testified for him, true story. In the middle of this thing, these two African-American guys walked in \u2014 and they were the only two African Americans in the courtroom besides the court reporter \u2014 and I saw them sitting there and they were kind of nodding their head agreeing with our witnesses. Then there was a break and they walked out. ", "I was sitting in the hallway and they looked at me, and they go, like, \u201cOh, you know, we were upstairs for a drug court case that we had and we heard about the judge getting sentenced because it makes us mad and we came in here and we have somewhere to go, but man, sitting in there, we think you need us in there.\u201d", "And I\u2019m like, \u201cI do need you in there.\u201d They sat there through that entire sentencing hearing. And for me, they were there to say, \u201cYou can\u2019t have two systems of justice, one for the rich and powerful and one for everyone else.\u201d ", "In the end, we got the sentence that we asked for and that judge went to jail, but I\u2019ll never forget those two guys because when I heard that Manafort sentence \u2014 and by the way, it\u2019s not over. There\u2019s going to be a new judge in the coming weeks on other charges and it may all be taken care of that way, but you just can\u2019t treat people differently, not just based on race, but also based on the types of crimes that they commit. That\u2019s wrong.", "Right. All right. Mueller Report, should it be released?", "Yes. Remember at the core of this is a foreign country trying to influence our election. And when people use that word \u201cmeddling,\u201d never use that. That is what I do when I call my daughter on a Saturday night and ask her what she\u2019s doing. This was an actual attack on our elections. That\u2019s what Mueller is investigating. I think the country has to see this. ", "I\u2019m hoping that when you see all the gory facts, it\u2019s going to help us to want to understand what went on, that\u2019s most important. But too, maybe it\u2019ll compel my colleagues to immediately put in place that Honest Ads Act and do more than Senator Lankford and I already did, which was get 360 million to the states for shoring up election equipment, but actually pass our Secure Elections Act to have backup paper ballots. What is so outrageous about that, right? That\u2019s why they have to see the report. I questioned Barr on that. He was all squiggly, you know, well ...", "Squiggly?", "Squiggly, yeah. You don\u2019t want to call the Attorney General manic, but he wouldn\u2019t really commit to making it public. This was going to be his moment. I hope I\u2019m wrong. I didn\u2019t vote for him because of that but I hope that he comes through. I hope that he makes that whole report public because America deserves to see it.", "All right. Putin, just go ahead.", "Putin.", "Putin, just go ahead. ", "It\u2019s just like a lightning rod, what about Putin?", "Yeah.", "Okay, well, you look at what he\u2019s done. It\u2019s not just the elections, right? This is bringing down a plane. This is like killing innocent people. This is a dictator. When Donald Trump went and sat next to him and embraced his views of what happened over his own intelligence, that was so wrong. You don\u2019t show strength that way. You show weakness. ", "That is why I continue to support NATO. It\u2019s why I went with Senator McCain on one of the last trips before he got sick where we stood with the president of Ukraine on the front line on New Year\u2019s Eve to make the point that America stands with our allies and that\u2019s why we went to Lithuania and Latvia and Georgia and Estonia, don\u2019t forget Estonia, because we wanted to make that point.", "I think we are at the moment where Congress actually \u2014 because of how Donald Trump is cozying up to Kim Jong Un or the crown prince in Saudi Arabia after they murder a journalist for an American newspaper \u2014 we are at a point where Congress must stand up and make clear that we stand with our allies for democracy. We stand against these acts of dictators and these murders and that we stand with sanctions, that we are a country that has always been a beacon of democracy. ", "And one last thing I will add, since I brought up Saudi Arabia and the Khashoggi murder, is that we stand up for the First Amendment while we have a president in the White House that tweets whatever he wants in the morning but doesn\u2019t respect the amendment that allows him to do it.", "On that, we have two more things, his attacks on the press. I don\u2019t love talking about the press, but these attacks are really quite an astonishing thing to happen from the president of the United States. How do you look at it?", "I still didn\u2019t hear it because the claps ...", "The attacks on the press. What do you ...", "The attacks on the press, yes.", "And at the same time calling them all up himself.", "Right. As I said, I\u2019m a journalist\u2019s daughter. My dad spent his entire life in journalism, starting with the AP where he got to actually call the 1960 election for John F. Kennedy. Minnesota, Illinois, and California were the three states out. He went from a hardscrabble mining town to interview everyone from Chicago Bears Coach Mike Ditka to Ronald Reagan to Ginger Rogers. ", "If I wasn\u2019t for the First Amendment, my dad would never talk to me again. No matter what the press does, as long as they are doing their constitutional duty, I think it\u2019s very important that you not attack the press. You can disagree with them. You can defend yourself. You can make arguments on the other side, but we must allow access in a free democracy. ", "To me, that is one of the most evil things that\u2019s going on right now because it doesn\u2019t feel like it, because the press is so strong and because you don\u2019t always agree with every story they wrote. But because of that, you don\u2019t then turn around and start trying to use the wheels of government, like it appears the president did from the news reports last week in going after CNN. You can\u2019t use your power to go after the press. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve always asked every attorney general nominee about not sending journalists to jail, neither former attorney general Sessions or Barr would really answer that question and I\u2019m now following up in writing, which I found disturbing, but we must stand up for the First Amendment.", "All right. Impeachment.", "Okay. This is like the Kara lightning round. ", "Yeah. ", "Okay, so, and I think you\u2019re going to hear this from other senators that may have braced this stage. We are in a different position in the Senate. We are the jury, and so I never comment on evidence. I didn\u2019t as a prosecutor before the case came before me. We will see what comes out of the Mueller Report. We will see what comes out of the House, and then it\u2019s our constitutional duty to look at evidence and make a decision. I never weigh in on what is impeachable or what should be impeachable, just because that is our profound constitutional duty.", "All right, that\u2019s fair. Representative Omar. \u201cI want to talk about political influence in this country that says it\u2019s okay to push for allegiance to a foreign country.\u201d To be fair, what did you think of that? She\u2019s from Minnesota.", "I did not agree with what the Representative said there because I believe you can be true to your country and advocate for another country, whether it is Israel or Canada or Ethiopia. There are many Americans that feel strongly that they love their own country, but they advocate for maybe it\u2019s the country of their own ancestry or maybe it is another country that they care a lot about. ", "I didn\u2019t like what she said there. But what I do believe is that the president has ignited in his own way a string of things against other people. It is everything from we see anti-Semitism on the rise to anti-Muslim rhetoric on the rise. I try to go back home and look at how we\u2019ve handled some of this. We have the biggest Somali population in the country. In fact, Ilhan Omar is a refugee herself and she is in a unique position to advocate for refugees from Somalia and I hope you\u2019ll see this and the fact that the president has put what I consider to be unfair caps on refugees to talk about those issues. ", "One of the things ... My favorite story is about our state, because we have a strong Jewish population and we also have a major Muslim population. One of my best stories was when the Jewish Community Center got a bomb threat and not just the staff there, but the young kids that had been in the swimming pool, senior citizens in an exercise class were wandering around outside of that community center in the cold because they had to immediately leave and they finally found some warehouse to be in. ", "When they got back, the first call they had gotten in their messages was from the Islamic Center asking if they needed a place to meet. We have Happy Ramadan signs in front of all of our churches, not all of them, but a big part of our churches in our religious community. During the Super Bowl, we staged a football game between faith leaders with one of our more prominent rabbis, a woman, throwing a pass to an imam. ", "We have tried, it went viral, over and over again to try to bridge that gap. What I don\u2019t like is when rhetoric, no matter who it comes from but who I see it primarily coming from is the president, doesn\u2019t try to fix things but tries to make things worse. Our goal should be to see the populations in our country as not diminishing America. They are America.", "My last question, who do you, if you had to pick a politician you would be most like, who do you think it is, in the past?", "Wow. It is hard for me to pick one politician, but my mentor has been and I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019d want to be quite like him, is Walter Mondale. He\u2019s a really good guy, but in the modern day, I\u2019m trying to think who it would be. I don\u2019t know.", "You can do a dead one.", "There are so many. I really don\u2019t have one person.", "Who\u2019s the person you look up to?", "I have always looked up to some of the women that came before me that were incredible that were mentors to me like Olympia Snowe and Barbara Mikulski, the dean of the women senators who were so strong and taught me so many things. Like Barbara Mikulski would, she was so short she would stand on ...", "Don\u2019t insult short people.", "Yeah. She would stand on a couch and she would literally say, \u201cSquare your shoulder, put your lipstick on, and get ready for a revolution!\u201d ", "I\u2019d be like, \u201cWhat revolution?\u201d", "\u201dWhatever we\u2019re going to go vote on!\u201d", "They were incredible. But I do want to mention one person. And by the way, when you look at, as David Brooks said, \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you got till it\u2019s gone.\u201d One great president was Barack Obama, but let\u2019s keep going. ", "I did want to mention one president I got to meet recently was Jimmy Carter. I\u2019ve met him a few times. And I got to go to Plains to see him. He is 95 years old and he was giving me advice on how he ran his campaign in the \u201970s. It was just incredible serving me \u2014 with Rosalynn \u2014 pimento cheese sandwiches. He then sent me an email the next day at 95, signed J.C., also the initials for Jesus Christ as you know ...", "I got that.", "That was an amazing thing. I think I told you back in the green room, I had visited when I did the Atlanta, the Democratic Dinner for Georgia, I told Jimmy Carter this, the Carter Presidential Library, looking for Mondale memorabilia a few years ago, like where is Joan\u2019s dress? ", "And on the wall were these words from Walter Mondale, looking back at the four years which weren\u2019t perfect, and as you know, they lost every election, but there was one thing that is important to cherish from that time. Mondale looked back at that time and he said these simple words, I wrote them down, put in my purse, didn\u2019t think they were relevant until Donald Trump won. ", "Those words were, \u201cWe told the truth. We obeyed the law. We kept the peace.\u201d I think that is the minimum that you should expect from a president of the United States.

I think it took way longer for us to become a punching bag. The day we launched, or maybe the day after we launched, we had a all-hands meeting in DC, but there was only about 30 of us or so.

What didn\u2019t you like about it, what were those things?", "Those things, but also sort of how self-important the industry was. One of the basic problems is, if you just look at the way that editorial teams are staffed, those are the gatekeepers, supposed to be sifting through everything that\u2019s out there and finding the best stuff. But if you make the salaries of those jobs so low, then only children of privileged families can afford to take those jobs, you are, by the very nature of the structure of the industry, really narrowing who you can address as an audience. So I really wanted to open things up so around those years I was working on ...", "So what things did you work on, to try\u2026? So, getting on the e-reader?", "I really tried to engage with self-publishing. I actually applied for a million and a half in innovation funding from Pearson, the parent company, and started a platform called Book Country, which was, essentially, a highly professionalized version of Wattpad.", "Explain that.", "Anyone could post their work in progress ", "if", " they gave feedback to somebody else who already had their work on the platform. So, basically, a huge online writers\u2019 workshop focused on science fiction, fantasy, mystery, crime and thriller, because those are the categories of writers who are really open to fan feedback. ", "From Penguin\u2019s perspective, the idea was, we\u2019ll get a lot of data about what\u2019s happening on the platform and be able to invite some of those more successful authors into a traditional contract. But I was really like, self-publishing is taking hold. I think it was around that time Clay Shirky said \u201cpublishers are a button now.\u201d ", "I really wanted to open the frame and sort of experiment with what the real value was and do a better job than the music industry had done, proving what they were worth. ", "Which was a disaster.", "Yeah. So, as time went on, I began to really focus on audio and e-book growth globally. I shifted away from working for the US company, to reporting to the global CEO.", "That\u2019s Marjorie [Scardino], right?", "That was John Makinson, who reported to Marjorie. So it was a $300 million global business, and one of ways that we were expanding it was through a geographic expansion unit \u2014 opened trade in fifteen markets. I was still really wrestling with format. ", "I was inspired by the history of Penguin. Penguin is a really interesting company. It started in the \u201930s in London by a guy called Allen Lane who felt really passionate about the idea that everyone should be able to buy a great book for less than the price of a pack of cigarettes. He also was really interested in \u2026", "The classics.", "Yeah. So he went around town and bought paperback rights to all these great books and the publishers were like, \u201cOh, paperbacks!\u201d", "Right. \u201cOh, Homer.\u201d", "Right.", "Really.", "\u201dWho\u2019d want a paperback? And everything published in paperback is such poor quality, sure, you can have these rights.\u201d So he created the paperback format and he also really messed around with distribution. He built vending machines on railway platforms to catch people on their commute.", "That\u2019s technology!", "And make sure that they had something great to read, yeah. So I was really inspired by his work.", "Meet the customer where they are.", "Exactly. So I was inspired by that. I started playing around with short format and asking authors to write sort of prequels to their big upcoming novels so we could release a digital short. All of the work was around how could we have more contact with the fans than waiting for two years from now, when the next book is available? ", "The reason for that is I sat in 22 financial meetings a month looking at what drove success, and the clearest way to improve your chances of success is to come back on a regular cycle with a similar book to what you released before. ", "Called the dancing monkey theory, they keep dancing the monkeys.", "Keep doing it over and over, at eight o\u2019clock. The traditional publishing response to that was to ask the most successful authors to write faster so you could publish three books a year instead of one. I was like, well, that\u2019s a lot of work and most authors can\u2019t keep up with that schedule.", "And then their quality goes down.", "Quality suffers dramatically. So I was looking instead, actually, at what the music industry was doing with unbundling the album and taking each piece of content and using it as a marketing tentpole in a really organic way, giving yourself a real reason to go back up for the funding. It just so happens in publishing and reading, there\u2019s a long history of serialization. ", "Of course, Armistead Maupin and Charles Dickens and ...", "Exactly.", "In newspapers.", "In newspapers and weekly magazines. I actually learned recently that everyone talks about Charles Dickens as the kind of grandfather of serialization, which is true, but the same year that he wrote \u201cThe Pickwick Papers,\u201d which was his first serial, in France, a newspaper owner was looking to take his weekly newspaper and make it a daily paper and he was trying to come with a reason why people would buy the paper so much more often.", " ", "So he asked the writer \u2014 and I will butcher this pronunciation, but \u2014 Honor\u00e9 de Balzac to write a serial so that each day a new installment was there in the paper and people had a reason to go and spend their, whatever amount the paper was at that point. ", "So there is this long history of a tight relationship between weeklies, magazines, newspapers and \u201cbooks.\u201d But it\u2019s somehow fallen away. So I decided to run some experiments and ask authors to let us release pieces of their books, out in conventional distribution through Amazon, Apple, Google, and we four and five X\u2019d the sales, just through breaking the price. They got a taste ...", "You know the porn industry did that.", "No. No, no, no, tell me. Tell me. ", "That\u2019s it. They just released bits. Here\u2019s a little bit, now would you like to buy more? They were very smart. It was a woman, I can\u2019t remember, she was brilliant. It was back in the \u201990s. I was like, \u201cThis woman is onto the right idea.\u201d ", "Got it.", "A lot of ideas started like that.", "The atomization of content started with porn.", "It did in a lot of ways. Actually, Tinder was born from a porn idea. Anyway, they are very creative people, let me just say, and they have got a lot of competition, so they know how to be creative. Taking it a way back from porn, so you saw this and it worked really well. So what did that say to you?", "It worked really well until I thought, \u201cOkay, there\u2019s really an opportunity here.\u201d At the same time, I was seeing a lot of the data around the growth of audiobooks, which happened slightly behind the growth of e-books but was perhaps a little bit more organic in its growth. E-books were driven so aggressively by device sales and audiobooks just started to creep up and creep up. So many people have a smart phone so they didn\u2019t need a separate device and the cost of audio production was coming down so breadth of catalog was much richer. ", "So I was seeing that audiobook listeners were getting younger and younger and bigger and bigger audiences, over 30 percent growth in audiobooks last year. There\u2019s so much heat around podcasts, and obviously it\u2019s a huge industry, but audiobooks is a paid industry that\u2019s been around for a long time. That said to me, \u201cOkay, you\u2019ve got this growth in audiobooks, ", "clear", " success in breaking books into pieces and an environment where everyone feels overwhelmed. Let\u2019s take these obvious patterns and evolve the delivery of book content.\u201d", "We\u2019re here with Molly Barton, the CEO of Serial Box. How do you describe it? So you were doing this and seeing signs that people liked this. You were actually doing something that had been done, too, in a different format but you were just technologizing it, whatever the word is. What made you move to doing this? What was the impetus that got you there?", "Well, the success of the experiments that I had run ...", "Within a big organization.", "Within a big organization really made me feel confident that there was something there. I had sort of been bitten by the entrepreneurial bug. I sat on the board of three startups that Pearson and Penguin had invested in. ", "Which ones?", "All consumer-facing book retail platforms. So, one in New York, called Bookish, which was the book industry\u2019s attempt at Hulu. One in Australia, in Melbourne, called Bookworld, and then one in London, called E-Books By Sainsbury\u2019s. So, I really sort of got in there with those teams because they were very small and up against a huge task that was much too ambitious for what\u2019s possible for a startup. That\u2019s what happens when big companies try to get in there.", "Oh, yeah. I was at the Wall Street Journal with my startup. That was a delight, every step of the painful journey.", "Yeah, I remember. So, I had seen a lot of the mistakes of how to try to drive innovation within the industry. So, I felt there was a good opening, because I had had the background. I had a mix of editorial experience, global experience, digital and audio business experience. And, I love working on product development. My team at Penguin had built a lot of apps in collaboration with other media companies. I love being in the situation where I\u2019m switching tasks all day. So, a startup environment is great to me.", "I left about four years ago, and interestingly, my business partner ... I didn\u2019t know at the time, he was working on the same concept. We were introduced by Evan Ratliff, who started the Atavist, and he said, \u201cMolly, you know, I\u2019ve met this guy Julian. He\u2019s working on serialized content, and you\u2019re the only other person that I know, so I figured you should meet him. I don\u2019t even know if he\u2019s smart.\u201d So we got on the phone and he said to me ... We had this really awkward call, because we were competing.", "Within a couple minutes, though, he dropped all pretense and said, \u201cReally, my ambition is to be HBO for reading.\u201d I started laughing, and he was like, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ", "that", " bad an idea.\u201d I was like, \u201cNo, no, no. I literally have that phrase written in my deck that I\u2019ve been sharing with investors.\u201d So, we had ... He came to the idea from ...", "Wow. So like, \u201cLet\u2019s join together\u201d?", "Yeah. So, he came to the idea from the consumer experience. He had graduated from Duke Law School and was working in the Obama Administration, in the Department of Justice, on gun control policies. So he was like, \u201cGod, this is a huge job. I don\u2019t have any time.\u201d But somehow, was managing to slip in a comic book or an episode of TV, and kept thinking to himself, \u201cIf someone would just deliver book content to me differently, it wouldn\u2019t feel like such a psychological lift to start.\u201d", "So that made a lot of sense to him. He spent part of his childhood in Asia, and serialized reading on phones is the dominant form of reading there. Has been for 10 or 12 years. China Literature is the dominant player in the space, but there are five or six other companies behind them. We came together, got to know each other, launched in September 2015.", "And, you raised funding from ...", "At the outset, we did it, sort of, the most honest, hardest way. Meaning, we wanted to develop a proof of concept before we went out and raised external funds. So, we bootstrapped. We got a little bit of help from family and friends. Our first phase of the strategy was to stand up the platform. ", "So, you did it in a responsible way. How unusual. Not using OPM.", "In retrospect, yeah, yeah, yeah. We spent about 24 months, actually, before raising external capital, proving early product market fit. So really ... Just to say it really clearly, we\u2019re evolving the delivery of book content for the smartphone age. What we do is, we deliver audiobook and e-book installments that are bundled together so you can switch back and forth between reading and listening.", "And, it knows where you are, that\u2019s the astonishing...", "It knows where you are.", "That\u2019s what I love about it.", "Yeah, it\u2019s great for the commute. I mean, most Americans have a 22 ... The average is a 22-minute commute, and part of that is walking, part of it\u2019s riding. So, we really wanted to tune the experience to that daily ritual and make it easy to keep going. So, you can be walking to the subway, listening, hop on your train ...", "And you\u2019re right where you are.", "Yup. ", "I still keep losing my spot in both, audio and ... It\u2019s really irritating.", "Yeah. ", "\u201cWhere am I? Oh, did I put the thing in right?\u201d I just ...", "Well, and also, just that whole idea of breaking it into parts. It\u2019s so simple, but on the other hand, so useful. If you say to yourself, \u201cOkay, I know I have 45 minutes, then I can fit this into that.\u201d", "Right, and so you did this proof of concept.", "We did that proof of concept. ", "What was yours called, and what was his called?", "I had a name called Signal.", "Did he have Serial Box?", "Serial Box, yeah.", "Oh, okay. Better.", "Yeah, better. And he\u2019s a lawyer, so he\u2019d already trademarked it, so ...", "Okay, good. So, what the hey.", "Yeah. So, we stood up the platform. We also created ... The other thing that we\u2019re doing is kind of industrializing content development. We\u2019re using methods from television that we\u2019ve adapted based on my own editorial experience, so that teams of writers write Serial Box originals that we release. We do distribute other publishers\u2019 content, but we have Serial Box originals, most of which are written by teams. So, the first couple of years was trying to build up a small catalog.", "Right. Of books?", "Mm-hmm.", "So, you\u2019re publishing books?", "Mm-hmm.", "This is individuals, or teams?", "Teams.", "Meaning?", "Four or five writers.", "Writing something? Such as...", "Mm-hmm. The same way that a team of writers writes television. We have a lead writer, and then we hire for ...", "Give an example of that so people can understand. I know what you\u2019re doing, but explain that.", "Sure. So, one example is our first horror series that we just released about a month ago, called \u201cSilverwood.\u201d So that, actually, originated as a web series on YouTube, and it was an anthology story structure. And we thought, \u201cWow, there\u2019s almost a million subscribers who are into this show, but there\u2019s a real opportunity to come in and write a narrative spine.\u201d So, we hired Brian Keene, who\u2019s one of the best horror writers in the world. He\u2019s won the Bram Stoker Award a bunch of times. He\u2019s considered a Grand Master. And then, we surrounded him by a really great team of other writers, including a pair of sisters who write together as The Sisters of Slaughter, and a writer who works with Stephen King quite often.", "So, we put together this kind of supergroup of horror writers, and they built a \u201cseason.\u201d So, 10 episodes, that at the end, you\u2019ve essentially read a book, but you\u2019ve done it in the same way that you watch TV, of like, \u201cOh, I\u2019ll try one.\u201d Then, if you like it, you can think, \u201cOh, I want another.\u201d", "Right, right. It\u2019s just brilliant. I think this is a fascinating thing. So, how do they do compared ... Do they, then, the publishers, want to publish them? Or you\u2019ve already published them?", "We publish them in e-book and audio, and then we hold the rights in all formats. Publishers have come to us and licensed print rights or licensed translation rights.", "Why not just print them yourselves? Because it\u2019s just another business?", "Yeah, I don\u2019t want to get into it right now. Maybe someday, but it\u2019s ... As you experienced, I mean, the economics ...", "Then you have to talk to Amazon, right?", "The economics aren\u2019t great, but we certainly may do that at some point.", "You\u2019ve already published it. The idea of what publishing is is different.", "Mm-hmm.", "You know, again, when I think about books I\u2019m like, why do I want to publish a book? I do it every day. I publish a book every month, you know what I mean?", "Mm-hmm.", "Or, something like that. The team of writers thing, I think is kind of brilliant. I mean, if you think about it.", "Well, I love the idea that it\u2019s not fixed in time. Like, we met with a writer yesterday who\u2019s working on a really interesting book involving some very visible political characters, and he was saying, \u201cI\u2019d love to leave it kind of open, so that I can go back and change episode two, or installment two, depending on what happens.\u201d And, it should be this kind of live stream, because people want Kara, what she thinks right now.", "Right, exactly.", "Not what she thought 18 months ago.", "Right, exactly. That\u2019s the problem with books, they\u2019re so static. That\u2019s why I absolutely don\u2019t want to ... Everyone\u2019s like ... I\u2019ve literally been given 30 offers of books, and I\u2019m like, no. I just don\u2019t. It\u2019s just, what, 18 months from now? I don\u2019t even understand that.", "Right, how am I supposed to see around the corner that far?", "Right. Unless it\u2019s something like a pure work of fiction, which I don\u2019t write, or something. I\u2019m sort of like, I have no interest. Non-fiction doesn\u2019t make any sense anymore, to me.", "Even in fiction, if you think about the difference between television and books, most novels are finished 18 to 24, maybe 36 months before they\u2019re published and they hit your hand in the store. Whereas television is written and then shot very quickly, within less than 12 months.", "They\u2019re pretty pertinent and relevant.", "They can pick up zeitgeists and what\u2019s going on in the news, and fold that into the show in real time.", "They can.", "So, we\u2019re doing that in our fiction series, which is really fun.", "It\u2019s interesting that you picked horror and stuff like that, that\u2019s easy to do that in, that you can work with a team. It\u2019s hard with some genres, presumably, right? Or, no? Do you do romance like this? You can do, what?", "Yeah. I mean, we focus on \u2026 For the originals that we produce ourselves, we focus on science fiction and fantasy, mystery, crime and thriller, and some contemporary drama. We\u2019re starting to work with partners that we\u2019ll be announcing soon on some of the major studios, on big franchise properties. But we\u2019re also working with a few non-fiction partners.", "Right. Which is interesting. But it also frees you, right, from being alone?", "Right.", "That\u2019s what I hated.", "Well, there\u2019s no reason for it. I mean, every time we bring writers together and take them through this process that we\u2019ve built, which is kind of our secret sauce, one of them will exclaim, \u201cThis is magic! This would\u2019ve taken me four months to figure out on my own. We just solved it in 20 minutes.\u201d", "Right, exactly. So, you got funding, then?", "Yes.", "How much?", "So, last August, we started raising ...", "Meanwhile, you\u2019re running a business?", "Yes. So, we\u2019d sort of proven product market fit, proven willingness to pay.", "What do people pay every week?", "They could either pay $1.59 each week for a given series, or pay up front and get a bit of a discount. That\u2019s for both the e-book and the audio. They get a notification on their phone each week saying, \u201cYour new episode\u2019s available.\u201d", "So, we raised $1.6 million in an angel round last August. We\u2019re actually in the midst of our seed round and negotiating term sheets.", "How hard is that?", "Hard, definitely.", "Because, there\u2019s been a lot of these. There\u2019s been a few. I can\u2019t remember all of them. There was a couple.", "Well, there have been some different things going on.", "What were the other ones?", "So Wattpad, everybody talks about. They\u2019ve been around a long time. The way that I describe the difference between what we\u2019re doing and what Wattpad is doing is, essentially, Wattpad became like YouTube for writing. Anyone can post, and that\u2019s fine, and sort of opens up self-publishing, in a way. But really, what goes on on Wattpad is more about ... More similar to Instagram, where it\u2019s ...", "Right, the Instagram, yeah.", "The social currency is writing rather than photos. Then, you\u2019ve got the kind of chat fiction apps, like Hooked and Yarn. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard people talk about them.", "Hooked, yeah.", "That format is very different and much more similar to a mobile game.", "Yeah, that\u2019s just really just the text going.", "It\u2019s just text back and forth.", "It makes me nervous. I don\u2019t know why.", "I think, I mean, that voyeuristic, kind of reading someone else\u2019s text messages.", "I just ... The horror ones I couldn\u2019t take. \u201cSomeone\u2019s in the house. Oh, God, someone\u2019s in the house!\u201d", "\u201cSomeone\u2019s in the basement! Don\u2019t go down there!\u201d", "Yeah, don\u2019t go there. It just was like, I can\u2019t take it in text.", "It\u2019s a little hard ... It\u2019s pretty limiting, in terms of story.", "Then, there\u2019s one other that was more fiction-like ...", "Oh, yeah.", "Yeah, there were a bunch of them. So, what is the worry that people have?", "In terms of investment?", "Yeah.", "I think there\u2019s just ... Well, women-led, I think the last stat I read was ...", "Yes, it\u2019s horrible.", "Two percent of venture capital went to women-led funding.", "They suck. They suck!", "So, you add that plus real reticence around media. So, it\u2019s a tough ...", "It\u2019s not a big enough \u2026 \u201cit\u2019s a niche.\u201d", "Right, right, right. So, we look to models in the marketplace like China Literature, which IPO\u2019d last year at a value of over $12 billion, and raised a billion dollars in their IPO. It\u2019s a serialized reading platform, simple as that. So, this just hasn\u2019t hit this market. We\u2019re ahead of it.", "You can do it with so many things. You can go into education. There\u2019s all kinds of ways this could go.", "Yeah. Well, and it\u2019s not ... You know, we\u2019re focused on fiction for the originals, because that\u2019s what we know best, and we have kind of unfair advantage there, in terms of access to the talent pool. But many kinds of content will benefit from this delivery.", "The biggest difference between what we\u2019re doing and some of the other startups that have tread in similar territory is that we\u2019re not kind of throwing out the whole traditional industry and saying, \u201cWe have a whole new format. You don\u2019t have to read. You just read text messages. You don\u2019t have to read any prose anymore.\u201d We\u2019re taking the best of the traditional industry and innovating on that.", "How is the reception from the publishing industry to that?", "They are really interested in the idea of installments. They want to see how ... What is the retention rate from one episode to the next? This whole idea of not asking someone to buy a whole book before they know if they want it is compelling.", "Right, which you had proved already at Penguin.", "Right. So, we\u2019re increasingly working with traditional publishers. Eventually, we feel like our catalog will probably look something like Netflix, where there\u2019s a bunch of Serial Box originals, maybe 5 to 10 percent of the content available, and then we have the balance of the catalog, distributing other content of the creators\u2019 work.", "Right, but what does the best on this platform? ", "Well, we have seen pretty even performance, which gives us a lot of confidence that we\u2019ve been creating high-quality work. Some of the older series on the platform, \u201cBook Burners\u201d and \u201cTremontaine,\u201d which were our first two... We\u2019ve had the most time to market them. They have more substantial audiences, but more recent releases like \u201cBullet Catcher\u201d ... ", "What is \u201cBullet Catcher\u201d? ", "\u201cBullet Catcher\u201d is an amazing, very light fantasy set in the West. It\u2019s this great relationship between a young girl and a bullet catcher, who is someone who can bend bullets. ", "Okay. Why does that ... Why did that do well? ", "That, I think, is catching people\u2019s interest. It has stunning art. It\u2019s beautifully written and it sort of appeals to anyone who is into \u201cThe Dark Tower.\u201d It\u2019s got some good comparables and we\u2019re just seeing it move out of the gate really quickly. We also recently released \u201cSilverwood,\u201d which I mentioned earlier, our first horror series, that is doing quite well, and then \u201cDead Air.\u201d ", "What\u2019s quite well? And \u201cDead Air\u201d? What is \u201cDead Air\u201d? ", "\u201cDead Air\u201d is sort of our response to Serial and S-Town, in a way. ", "Yeah. Is this a podcast or ... ", "It is ", "about", " a young podcaster who gets embroiled in an investigation in her hometown. It\u2019s set in the South, written by three best-selling southern American fiction writers.

", "Well, so we\u2019re looking at sub-categories that are trending and seeing a lot of attention and spikes in sales. We\u2019re also looking for gaps in the marketplace based on series that ended 15 years ago or TV shows that have cult following but have fallen off.

I don\u2019t wanna know your mother\u2019s ...", "Exactly. I was a lawyer for a long time, represented a lot of strange and unusual people, including ... I spent a lot of time at the Export-Import Bank, which was actually a really fun thing to do when nobody knew what it was. It was actually going around the world, working on infrastructure projects, of all things. Then I decided to switch careers and I got a connect at the US Chamber of Commerce, and got into those whole world of, as they say, \u201cadvocacy,\u201d here in DC, you know, jumping into the swamp, lobbying and communications. I really love that. ", "I was the CEO at the US Chamber for almost 10 years. The great thing there was dealing with every different kind of business you can imagine, ", "every", " industry out there. I reached the end there, I\u2019d done that long enough.", "Tell me about what the US Chamber shifted from doing, because we got in touch because of internet stuff, so talk about how that shifted.", "Sure. Again, for those of you who don\u2019t know, the US Chamber is the 800-pound gorilla of lobbying organizations in town.", "One of the many.", "Yeah, a long base of industrial companies, historic industrial companies, and businesses that everybody would think of as being in a \u201cchamber of commerce,\u201d right? One of my tasks was to really reach out to the tech industry and try to find ways to bring them into the fold of that conversation. ", "One of the surprising things was how much everybody had in common. Like, the tech guys like to talk about how different they are than traditional businesses, how they have different perspectives. Actually, if you look at one of the things they care about ...", "Taxes.", "They care about taxes, right. The best thing, by the way, was on ", "Veep", " ... do you remember when Julia Louis-Dreyfus meets that Mark Zuckerberg character? He said, \u201cWe\u2019re post-tax.\u201d For me, it crystallized everything about dealing with the tech business in that they may not have identified with the Chamber, but their issues were very much the same.", "Yes, they suddenly seem to like money all of a sudden, right.", "Exactly.", "Just realized that.", "So as part of that, I think you and I met ... I was spending a lot of time in Silicon Valley dealing with those folks. I got a call about what was then the Newspaper Association of America, and it was immediately ...", "Which used to be a very big, powerful organization.", "Used to be big, and then it shrank tremendously and was in some trouble, frankly. They asked me whether I\u2019d be interested and I\u2019m like, well listen, I\u2019m a big consumer of the product. The fact of industries being in transition didn\u2019t really scare me very much. I\u2019d dealt with everybody. I spent two years of my life dealing with domestic manufacturers, right, I mean those guys have been disrupted, okay?", "What I saw was an industry where, oddly, even though they\u2019d been disrupted, the audience for the product is bigger than ever. They\u2019re not the coal business. The coal business, people ... nice people by the way, I met a lot of people in the coal business. Not a great business. People don\u2019t want what they make as much.", "Right. My family is in the coal business, but go ahead.", "Again, tough business. Nice people.", "You\u2019d be surprised how many people still want coal, but go ahead. My brother\u2019s in it.", "But people consume the news product ", "way", " more than ever. Multiples of peak print era. So I was like, well this is something. This is an intellectual challenge, it\u2019s important, it matters to our civic society, so let\u2019s try to figure out the bridge to that future understanding that we have an audience, and that\u2019s a good thing to build a bridge from.", "Right, absolutely. So it was called the Newspaper Association, now it\u2019s not. Explain the shift in tone for what\u2019s it\u2019s supposed to ... who does it represent?", "2000 publishers, from legacy newspapers to now we have some digital-only news organizations. One thing about newspaper is, whenever you said \u201cnewspaper,\u201d people heard \u201cthunk.\u201d It was the thing that hit the driveway. Really, I wanted to have a conversation about the future, the news publishing business in the future. As part of a whole range of changes we were making at the Association, I said, \u201cListen, we\u2019re news media, our connective tissue is we hire and pay reporters, that\u2019s a good thing, and everybody who does that should be eligible to be in the Association.\u201d", "And that\u2019s been like ... the news media that\u2019s online, it\u2019s sort of been ... just the way the tech people have been fractured, there was an Internet Association and then it didn\u2019t ... it just went ... These people didn\u2019t like to associate necessarily. Now they\u2019ve hired like crazy, and we\u2019ll talk about Google and Facebook\u2019s lobbying power, which was negligible and now is massive, essentially, in Washington, but they didn\u2019t organize. Like, the online news business people didn\u2019t ... it was an adjunct to news, from my experience.", "Yeah. If you looked at the legacy publishers, they started out having a separate digital divisions-", "They did. Washington Post had one across the river so they didn\u2019t unionize and stuff like that.", "Frankly, I was also used to businesses ... as you said, you know we\u2019re not joiners.", "Right.", "And we\u2019re new and we\u2019re different and we have a different perspective. The bottom line, what\u2019s become clear is that you have some folks that have a print business \u2014 a declining print business, by the way \u2014 and some folks who don\u2019t, but otherwise we\u2019re all in the mix together and trying to build a digital future for this business. There are very few business model or other distinctions between the two sets.", "Talk about the declining part, the newspaper part. How many members had you had? What\u2019s the makeup of it now?", "We haven\u2019t had that many declines in actual membership. Despite what the president says, there haven\u2019t been all that many failures in the news business.", "We\u2019ll get to that.", "What you have is, for a lot of legacy publishers, a declining print business, which, by the way, is still quite lucrative. What people don\u2019t get is it still pays for most of everything.", "Yes it does. It used to ", "really", " pay, but ...", "A friend of mine does the print at a very digitally-focused news organization everybody would know about, but he does the print part, and they never talk about the print part. He said, \u201cI just want them to buy me lunch every once in awhile and thank me for paying for everything.\u201d People can get very ", "Callous Sophisticate", " about their digital news consumption, but please understand, for the most part, it\u2019s still heavily subsidized by print products. But those are declining, and declining steadily.", "You have a declining business that still makes money, an exploding digital business, where the audience is many times what it was even in peak print era, that doesn\u2019t make nearly as much money.", "If at all.", "So it\u2019s managing this runway, if you will, and the runway\u2019s getting closer to the end of how do we build a digital future, understanding that this thing that still makes a lot of money is declining clearly?", "What about the numbers of news organizations? You just saw Gannett and then the Cox papers and things like that being sold off to hedge funds and things like that.", "Yeah, there\u2019s a lot of consolidation going on. Where we\u2019ve lost is super local, community newspapers, and there\u2019s a statistic that 1,300 local community newspapers have gone away. You have not seen broad-based failures, particularly at regional or major newspapers, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s pretty, right?", "If you look at the financials of the public companies, it\u2019s rough, it\u2019s rough out there. So we haven\u2019t yet lost a lot of major publishers, there\u2019s a lot of consolidation and a lot of cutting going on trying to make it to the future.", "Well, let\u2019s talk about that consolidation, because hedge fund companies buying newspaper organizations is not a good formula for success, especially when those hedge fund organizations are known for cutting in order to squeeze out either real estate or whatever they\u2019re looking for, often real estate, actually.", "You\u2019ll find the people who are doing better have actually invested in the journalism. Obviously people always talk about the New York Times, and yeah, they\u2019re doing great, but Minneapolis Star Tribune, or what\u2019s happening at the LA Times, they\u2019re reinvesting in the news rooms because it turns out that\u2019s what people want to consume. The folks who just cut, cut, cut, that is a circle-the-drain kind of strategy and it\u2019s not building for the future.", "But when these companies do consolidate, what happens, then, to an organization like yours? How do you manage it when you think about ... where do you see consolidation going?", "Well, there\u2019s going to be a lot of it this year potentially, between what\u2019s happening with Gannett and ...", "Cox.", "\u2026 and Tribune, and all the rest. There\u2019s a lot at play currently. Consolidation in and of itself doesn\u2019t scare me so much because there\u2019s two things. There\u2019s consolidation on the business side, and then, do you still have reporters and journalists in these communities? If consolidation on the business side can help sustain the journalism, then great. If it\u2019s just a means to cut everybody and cut more, then I think that\u2019s gonna end up being a losing strategy over the long run. Also, consolidation now doesn\u2019t mean what it did in the \u201980s or \u201990s, okay, where ...", "Right. We\u2019ll talk about that.", "It is not like these legacy news publishers have monopoly voices or monopoly power in any circumstance. They are folks who pay reporters and trying to do great journalism and trying to make it work economically while their print is declining and the digital isn\u2019t making a lot of money.", "So when you have that ... you don\u2019t represent broadcasters.", "I do not.", "You do not. That\u2019s another whole organization, but they\u2019re news organizations, though.", "Yeah, absolutely.", "They\u2019re seeing a very big shift in ownership and everything else. So all means of news delivery is shifting really dramatically.", "Yeah, and it\u2019s all going online. If you actually talk to one of our members about their primary online competition, it\u2019s often the local TV station\u2019s website. Now the one thing about TV stations, first of all, we\u2019re all converging into this digital space, but local TV historically, yeah, they did ", "some", " reporting, but a lot of the reporting they did was out of the local newspaper.", "That\u2019s right, they did. I recall being at the Washington Post and enjoying seeing my stories on ...", "Okay, so ... yeah. So as we\u2019re all converging in this digital space. I think one of the challenges for local broadcasting is like if there\u2019s been cutbacks in the local newspaper or newsroom, where are those stories coming from? ", "We\u2019ve been supportive, by the way. There used to be rules that the local broadcaster couldn\u2019t own the local newspaper, and I actually ...", "Doesn\u2019t matter.", "I said, \u201cListen, as an industry, we\u2019re neither dead nor monopolists, but we definitely can\u2019t be both.\u201d So the idea that they could combine ...", "That was a long-time issue. I mean, mostly because of Rupert Murdoch, as I recall. It was based around the idea of too much influence in a city, in a big city, that they would own the local news and the local paper.", "And by the way, you have monopoly power in things like advertising, which now is ridiculous.", "Right, exactly. So how would you assess ... and then in the next section I\u2019d like to talk about the big Google and Facebook, essentially, which dominates everything, and how you look at them. How would you assess the market right now that you represent?", "How do I assess it financially?", "Mm-hmm.", "Financially it\u2019s very stressed because, again, these declining print dollars aren\u2019t being replaced by sufficient digital revenue. Interestingly, at the same time, though, we\u2019re more central to the public conversation. People are talking about journalism more than they were even three or four years ago, and our president plays a role in that, but ...", "And we\u2019ll get to that, too.", "There\u2019s an understanding of the importance of journalism in society that just people are more aware of. So in a strange way, while we\u2019re financially stressed, we\u2019re also more central and more relevant than we\u2019ve been.", "Right. So when you set it up to where it\u2019s going, the big challenge for all these things, besides figuring out their new business plans, is the ascendance of Google and Facebook, essentially, in the digital advertising market, because that\u2019s where they\u2019re heading into, which is big headwinds.", "Absolutely. Two things ... well, I got a lot more than two things.", "Yeah, we\u2019re gonna get to ... we have a whole section for you. Well, let\u2019s set that up.", "Listen, in the traditional newspaper sense, we had the most direct relationship you could have with a customer. We made a physical product and we walked it up your driveway and handed it to you while you were in your bathrobe. ", "But in the digital space, first of all, there are now two companies that now sit between us and our customers in terms of the delivery of content, determining everything about that delivery, but who also then absorb an increasing and accelerating proportion of the digital ad revenue, and by the way, are reaching into localities. Google didn\u2019t used to have advertising products for your local florist, who was advertising in the local paper. Now they do, and so the advertising monopoly is expanding.", "At the same time, we actually count on these folks as a delivery and distribution mechanism. It\u2019s a challenge.", "Talk about them and how you all look at them, because you\u2019ve been pretty tough on them, and they\u2019ve had a pretty tough year. Talk a little bit about how you see them in the atmosphere, what they\u2019re doing to the atmosphere.", "They\u2019re our regulator. The government can\u2019t regulate the news business, First Amendment. But these guys can, and what I mean ...", "That\u2019s a really loaded sentence. What do you mean by that? They\u2019re our ...", "They determine which of our content gets delivered to who, in what priority, how it\u2019s monetized, whether we exist on their platforms or not. They stand between us and our audience and determine everything about that relationship.", "That power is a threat, certainly, and it has been because we have not had a good interaction with them, but one thing I always try to tell them is, it could be an opportunity. We need better technical solutions for the news business, and they could be a way to deliver great, high-quality content to people. If they have a fake news problem, guess what, we\u2019re in the real news business. So why can\u2019t we have a better, more productive relationship?", "So why?", "I wrestle with that all the time. As you know better than I, in dealing with tech firms for a long time, getting their head wrapped around what could be a socially positive thing that\u2019s hard to do technically. Again, they\u2019re the hammer people and the rest of the world\u2019s a nail, and if it\u2019s not an algorithm answer, they have a real problem with it. ", "For companies that talk all the time about the amazing things they\u2019ve done for the world, the amazing things they can do, mostly what they tell me is they can\u2019t do stuff. It\u2019s amazing how ...", "Yes, they become stupid.", "It\u2019s like, \u201cThat\u2019s impossible, I can\u2019t do it.\u201d It\u2019s like, \u201cYou guys just said you can change the world in all of these positive ways.\u201d", "Well, not that world.", "Yeah. News and journalism and the human world is a difficult, complicated, messy place. Right? ", "Right. ", "And they don\u2019t really want to touch it if they can help it.", "Right.", "But they\u2019re kind of okay if they roll over it and crush it. ", "What a nice way of saying it.", "What I try to say is, I know this is messy and you\u2019re not going to have perfect solutions, but we can help. We produce good stuff. We actually pay people to go out and do journalism.", "Right.", "And if we can thrive with you and you can improve the sweet/sour ratio of good information to bad, that\u2019s good for you too. Right?", "Right.", "And this isn\u2019t impossible.", "There\u2019s two parts to this. There\u2019s, one is they control the means of distribution or the current way people get a lot of their news. Facebook is 97 percent of news in the Philippines, for example. They control the pipes, essentially, but then they also want to own the digital advertising market, which is the lifeblood of how you make the stuff that goes over the pipes. But they don\u2019t want to be a media company that makes the stuff. ", "And so they allow just any old crap to flow over it, pretty much, and don\u2019t regulate it very much or think about regulating it or provide tools for people to do that. And they essentially leave it to the listener or the reader or the audience to determine what\u2019s crap and what\u2019s not. It\u2019s just they take the best, juiciest parts of the steak and then leave the shit behind. You know what I mean?", "No, exactly. Here\u2019s what I ask of them.", "Okay. ", "First of all, it\u2019s always good to talk about money. Money\u2019s a good thing, and they license other kinds of content. They license music. If Britney Spears is playing in the back of grandma\u2019s video on Facebook, Facebook\u2019s paying for a license for that, share of ad revenue. But the algorithm\u2019s hugely important. They could reward original quality journalism from sources who actually pay reporters over Macedonian teenagers, right? Just serve more of our stuff. Brand suppression is a huge challenge for us.", "Explain that. ", "Listen, when we were younger \u2026 there\u2019s always been crazy conspiracy theories. Right?", "Mm-hmm.", "When we were younger, it was your crazy uncle over the dining room table, right?", "Mm-hmm.", "That source was different from what was on TV, Walter Cronkite or whoever, and the paper that landed. And those were clearly different sources. In the internet blender, all that stuff is delivered to you exactly the same way.", "Right.", "And they, in every way you could imagine, suppress the origin of the information so that it\u2019s very hard. It puts a big onus on the public to figure out, \u201cIs this crazy Uncle Joe? Is this the New York Times?\u201d ", "Right.", "So the brand suppression thing, particularly in a business where trust is a key part of what we\u2019re delivering, is a huge business problem for us. But if you ", "increase", " the brand, the problem is your relationship then isn\u2019t necessarily with Facebook. People say, \u201cI got my news on Facebook,\u201d I think Facebook likes that. Whereas, \u201cI read the New York Times or the Des Moines Register on Facebook,\u201d that\u2019s a brand interfering with that relationship.", "Right.", "So they suppress our brands. And that\u2019s dangerous. That\u2019s bad for us in the trust business and that\u2019s bad for the public, frankly.", "Why do you imagine they do that part? Let\u2019s talk about that idea, distribution, wanting to ... And contrast Google with Facebook, if there is a contrast.", "There is a contrast. So why do they do that? ", "By the way, I\u2019m only talking about those two because they are the only two that matter. We can talk about Apple News, which is coming up. But go ahead.", "I\u2019m happy to talk about that as well. But yeah, this is ...", "It\u2019s really a Google and Facebook world.", "Right. Why they do that, I think they want you to be attached to their brands and they want you to stick around. And sticking around may mean reading whatever. Whatever keeps you interested.", "Whatever is viral. ", "If it is stuff that may not catch your attention for a minute, there\u2019s all the sort of automated disincentives to that. So I think it is kind of the end point of what were probably rational decisions on their part of keeping people engaged. The two ", "are", " different. Facebook\u2019s been more difficult and I wrestle with why that is.", "I think Google is getting a better sense of the importance of news and the news business. They do control discovery and they control what gets surfaced at the top and what doesn\u2019t. So for example, if you do a breaking news story and it pops up at the top of the search results, but guess how long it stays there? It\u2019s your story, by the way. It usually stays there for about six minutes before it\u2019s been copied and screwed over and people pave priorities over top of it.", "So they make a huge number of decisions in the discovery process that impact what you get to see and what you don\u2019t get to see. I\u2019d be happy to compare and contrast more, but I think Google seems to be wrestling with these at a deeper level, or at least currently.", "And then Facebook? ", "Facebook\u2019s a tough one. I haven\u2019t gotten the same sense of real sensitivity to what journalism is and the importance of it to society from them. It\u2019s been a more difficult relationship and I think you\u2019ll hear that commonly from a lot of news publishers. They seem less receptive to comments and complaints, but that can improve. That can get better. And you\u2019d understand their internal culture better than ...", "I think they could care less. That\u2019s what I would say. ", "Yeah. ", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything negative or positive. I think they could care less about a lot of things. They don\u2019t think about it at all. ", "Yeah.", "They don\u2019t have any interest in it, obviously.", "Did you ever read ", "Chaos Monkeys", "? ", "Yes, I did. I know Antonio and I spar almost, very frequently online. I like him a lot.", "There was that one piece in there about Facebook\u2019s engineering enterprise, but there\u2019s this thin layer of communications and legal and other things on the outside that most people interact with. So most people talking to Facebook, you\u2019re not talking to people who can change the machine, change the product.", "Right, absolutely.", "Mark can change the product, and it\u2019s very hard for us to find the people who can change the machine in ways to help journalism.", "Right. Then the third would be Apple News. This is just the distribution part. I\u2019m going to get to the advertising in a minute. And there would be Apple News, which is, how do you look at that?", "Let me talk about the current Apple News product. First of all, drives lots of traffic. You\u2019ll just see people\u2019s traffic numbers are off the charts from Apple News.", "They have no other business but to drive it. That\u2019s why they have nothing else. ", "But it also produces almost no money for a whole bunch of ... There\u2019s technical advertising and they take cuts.", "They\u2019re not in the advertising business.", "And they only allow certain ad units or whatever so the common refrain is, drives a lot of traffic and by the way, it doesn\u2019t even pay for the coffee. Right?", "Mm-hmm.", "So, okay. Actually, my one serious complaint with the current Apple News product is it doesn\u2019t have local news in it. It\u2019s a national and general interest. The only local news is stuff that pops up nationally.", "Nationally, right.", "And that is both a cause and effect of one of the dilemmas in local news in the sense that Apple is saying \u201cthis is what people want.\u201d Okay. But also, you\u2019re not exposing them to local. It ends up being a de facto suppression of local. ", "A big challenge that local news has had broadly is what I\u2019d call nationalization of news interest. And this was before Trump, but it\u2019s certainly been accelerated by him, where the public spends relatively more time and attention looking at national and general interest stories as opposed to local than they used to.", "Right, which is born by online.", "Right. That makes it hard for local news publishers, but that trend is also accelerated by things like Apple News and other products that don\u2019t even surface local news for you. ", "Right. ", "So it\u2019s kind of okay, some good, some blah, Apple News. They propose or they\u2019re talking about a new subscription layer in Apple News where they would take the $5 out of the $9.99. Really, they\u2019ve surfaced very few details about that so far.", "And then the digital advertising market.", "Yeah.", "It\u2019s now pretty much owned by Facebook and Google and now Amazon sort of slipping in off to the side in terms of products, which is always a big mainstay of local news and national news. How do you look at the digital advertising business? Because while they\u2019re maintaining their platform, they\u2019re already sucking all the, like I said, the juicy bits out. ", "Yeah. I\u2019m coming from an industry that had huge advertising businesses, but online, in the data wars, we\u2019re never going to have the data to compete with Google and Facebook. And as long as advertising online is geared around who\u2019s got the most data about Kara Swisher, then more and more money is going to flow to those folks. You can scream at the weather, but you\u2019re not going to change it. We\u2019re not going to win a data game. ", "That doesn\u2019t mean we give up all of our advertising products or we don\u2019t have some unique things to offer advertisers. But the trends toward the money going through Google and Facebook and to some degree Amazon are accelerating. Because you know, it\u2019s a data game. ", "Right. And then what do you do about that? ", "Well, I don\u2019t know that we, as news publishers, can do anything about it. I think there are anti-competitive and monopoly concerns.", "We\u2019ll get to that.", "Yeah, related to that. I think what we also forget is how recent the understanding that they were going to take all the ad money is. It\u2019s really the last three or four years. Until then, other people thought they could build ad-based businesses.", "Not me. No, they\u2019re vacuum cleaners. They\u2019ll take everything.", "But it became statistically very clear like three or four years ago that, oh, wait a minute. They get all of it.", "Right. I used to call them the Borg all the time. I remember they said, \u201cThat\u2019s mean, Kara.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cNo, that\u2019s Borg.\u201d They just will wander the universe sucking up everything that\u2019s valuable.", "And frankly, in my membership who are digital only, they\u2019ve obviously faced that front and center. All their digital ad dollars are getting sucked away by Google and Facebook. And by the way, they don\u2019t have a declining print business ...", "To live on. They suck up everything and then they don\u2019t have the responsibility of the platforms. They don\u2019t have to pay for what it costs to do the news, but they get all the benefits. Like, that\u2019s really, it\u2019s a simplistic way of doing it. I\u2019m sure Antonio would say that, but it really is. They get all the good stuff and none of the bad stuff. And that\u2019s why their businesses are so good, because they don\u2019t have the costs. ", "Yeah. And also, they\u2019re not doing much to sustain the people who are incurring the costs.", "Does that feel like charity to you? Some people say it shouldn\u2019t be charitable. I\u2019m like, well ...", "Do you mean like their $300 million over three years things?", "Yes. What do you think of those? ", "Charity isn\u2019t going to solve this problem. ", "Right. What\u2019d you think of that? I was like ...", "Charity is nice. I mean, what the hell? But that\u2019s not sustainable. We need something that is going to actually be a sustainable relationship over a long time.", "Suggestions? Because we\u2019re referring to the hundreds of millions of dollars that Facebook just recently put under news, which I was like, \u201cWhy wasn\u2019t it a billion?\u201d But that\u2019s just me. It wasn\u2019t a really substantive amount of money. ", "Yeah. By the way, a lot of that is for using their products. ", "Yes, of course it is. Are you kidding? It\u2019s like Microsoft and that pad that they were going to use in third-world countries. Oh, as long as you use a Microsoft product, that sounds great. Of course it is.", "To some degree, this is similar to the argument, people think that there are going to be philanthropists who are going to fly in and save everybody, or billionaires or whatever. Listen, actually a number of my members are owned by billionaires. One of the things I\u2019ve learned about them is for the most part, they don\u2019t like to write more checks.", "No, they don\u2019t.", "They\u2019ll write a check, say, \u201cHere you go.\u201d For the most part, they don\u2019t necessarily require a current return. They\u2019ll say, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to send me a check every year.\u201d But they don\u2019t like to write new ones. So that means you still have to build a sustainable thing that pays for itself.", "Right.", "And the same way the charity, charity is not going to sustain this thing. We need a business arrangement that provides value to the people who hire reporters. And then by the way, we then provide you good content so you have less fake news problems. That\u2019s money. That\u2019s data. They hoard all the data about our own readers.", "At the same time, they always tell us, \u201cYou need a closer relationship with your readers.\u201d This is also another Apple News problem, by the way, which is, \u201cYou need a closer relationship with your readers. We won\u2019t tell you who they are, by the way, just as long as you\u2019re cool with that.\u201d", "Yeah, exactly. We\u2019re here with David Chavern, the president and CEO of the News Media Alliance. He represents news organizations as they continue to figure out how they live in this new digital media environments dominated by Facebook, Google, and to an extent, Apple, and soon Amazon. What to do? You know, you go to them and say, \u201cWe want to provide you a better organization.\u201d They don\u2019t clean up the fake news. They don\u2019t clean up. You\u2019re sort of in a dirty city. I think of it as a real dirty city, like I call it, \u201c", "The Purge", " every night.\u201d What can be done? First, there are regulatory ways to do this, right?", "Yeah. ", "Where\u2019s that right now?", "Here\u2019s what we\u2019ve asked for, which is we\u2019ve asked for the ability to collectively negotiate with the platforms.", "Oh, interesting. ", "So interesting, under the current antitrust laws, and this is based in a precedent from the booksellers and Apple, the antitrust laws protect Google and Facebook ", "from", " us. I\u2019ll let that sink in for a minute. They protect Google and Facebook from us banding together. Right?", "Mm-hmm.", "And so we\u2019ve got a bill that was introduced by David Cicilline, chairman of the House Antitrust Subcommittee, that would allow us to band together as an industry and negotiate collectively with them. And what would we negotiate? ", "This is what you are doing in Europe, they were trying to do in Europe.", "Yeah, their proposals, like that.", "They\u2019re doing it, yeah.", "Were negotiated over money, data, brand suppression, algorithms.", "Right. So they can\u2019t keep you separate.", "Exactly. By the way, they negotiate with other people. The music folks get a deal. Where\u2019s the deal for news? But the only way we\u2019re going to get there, apparently, is to be able to band together and have one industry voice.", "How likely is this bill gonna pass?", "Actually I\u2019m feeling, there\u2019s that old saying, first they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they get mad at you, then you win. I think we\u2019re moving from laugh at us to get mad at us slowly.", "What happens? Because they\u2019ve got lobbyists coming out the ying-yang.", "A lot of lobbyists. ", "Yeah. These are people who used to disdain Washington. I just want to say, I\u2019ve been on so many receiving ends of them going, \u201cWe don\u2019t move in Washington,\u201d and now I\u2019m like, \u201cIs there someone you didn\u2019t suck up? Some horrible lobbyist you didn\u2019t suck up?\u201d", "We don\u2019t have much leverage, but we have some.", "With who?", "With politicians, policymakers. That leverage comes from the fact that news is important, right? Nobody\u2019s asking for congressional hearings about fake cat videos. That news is seen as important to the republic in a way that is disproportionate to maybe other kinds of content.", "Right.", "Making the argument that we\u2019re at a precipice with the news business. In a world where print is declining and we need to live off this digital world, we need a better deal from these platforms. And by the way, if we get a better deal, we actually can have a sustainable, good business for the country and ultimately one that would endure to the benefit of the platforms as well.", "One is collective bargaining with them, essentially.", "Yeah.", "The second, cleaning up their platforms.", "Cleaning up.", "How does that happen, from a regulatory point of view?", "Well, I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s a government answer for ...", "Well, Section 230.", "Section 230.", "You don\u2019t get immunity. You have to clean up your dirty, dirty, dirty platform.", "Section 230, the interesting things about it is my guys are responsible for ...", "That\u2019s right. Me, too.", "What they put in the paper. They can get sued all the time, right? The only actually parts of our business that have a 230 protection are the comments sections.", "Right.", "We would still moderate those. There\u2019s nobody that doesn\u2019t manage those and moderate those. The 230 played an interesting role in helping the whole ecosystem develop.", "What do you imagine should be done with them? I\u2019m very interested in Section 230.", "The interesting thing is they\u2019re sort of already half pregnant because they have the 230 protection but also Zuckerberg says at the hearings, \u201cWe\u2019re responsible for what happens on our sites.\u201d", "Right.", "Those two things are ...", "Should bigger organizations not get the protections from 230 and keep them for smaller organizations, for example?", "Yeah.", "They can do that.", "Applying 230 to Google and Facebook currently, particularly as they\u2019ve applied them, I think is ridiculous.", "They won\u2019t behave because they don\u2019t have to behave.", "It can\u2019t be they\u2019re protected and we\u2019re not. The content creators aren\u2019t.", "We want the consumer to be protected from all of you. That\u2019s the whole point.", "Yeah. I mean, I don\u2019t see a reason why they get those 230 protections at a given size.", "Where is that?", "Politically, where that is is there was a crack in the door on 230 ...", "With the porn and the ...", "SESTA and FOSTA. There are gonna be new cracks in that door. People are gonna talk about opioid sales and other things. But we need to have a bigger conversation about content and the future of the news business and that\u2019s part of what I\u2019m trying to drive.", "Okay. What about in cleaning up that fake news, that\u2019s one way to do it. Do you see any antitrust actions being taken on these companies?", "On the advertising side. I understand something like Google and the Google ad side, they own all sides.", "Yes, they do.", "The sales side, the exchanges in the middle, the buy side, and they also participate in all those markets themselves, as their own independent player.", "Mm-hmm. They like that game, that\u2019s a good game.", "That\u2019s actually a very good thing.", "They\u2019re so smart.", "By the way, there have been other industries in the past that have been able to do that. You just can\u2019t do it forever.", "Right.", "Eventually, the antitrust authorities come knocking.", "Movie theaters, yeah.", "They were allowed to acquire a lot of businesses at times when the federal government was asleep at the switch. There has to be some analysis of the role that they play in the advertising markets. Now, do I think that\u2019s gonna win back ad business necessarily for news publishers?", "I\u2019m not necessarily willing to make that argument, but I think it\u2019s obvious that at some point, when you\u2019re getting 80-plus percent of digital ad revenue, somebody\u2019s gotta say, \u201cHmm, that sounds slightly anti-competitive.\u201d", "Right. But is there any move on the Hill to do that? There\u2019s stuff going on in Europe, for sure.", "Absolutely.", "Which goes too far, I think a lot of people feel. The [right to be] forgotten, the copyright stuff.", "People are ... There\u2019s hints about it in the ecosystem and certainly Dave Cicilline in the House is talking about holding hearings on antitrust in the platforms. This is an area where the US government has to put a lot more investment in terms of developing a new policy, researching the impact of these platforms on these markets, and really bringing some regulation to bear. You just can\u2019t sustain this trajectory.", "Does the current mood pushed by President Trump and others hurt that, the idea of fake news? He just did it this weekend again in large caps. The \u201cfake news\u201d ... How do you react to that as a ...", "Groan.", "Yeah, but it\u2019s dangerous. You can groan, like what a silly ...", "It\u2019s really dangerous. Listen, I represent \u201cfake news,\u201d in his calculation.", "Mm-hmm.", "I think that rhetoric is horrific and what he does to individual reporters is really bad and dangerous. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s gonna impact these debates about the role of the platforms. What I try to use it as is saying, it\u2019s an opportunity for us to talk about who we really are and the value we really provide. He says this, here\u2019s what we really are.", "But you\u2019re on his agenda. You\u2019re talking about whether you\u2019re fake or not.", "Yeah, that\u2019s a good point. I also try to be very careful not to get sucked into whatever his latest tweet is about fake news.", "Do you think it has a real impact, or is it just him screaming?", "No, you see the rhetoric picked up by people. Look at on TV about his rallies and stuff, people chanting \u201cFake News.\u201d We hear it all the time.", "Not so sure those are buyers of newspapers, but okay.", "No, but it degrades the public discourse in a serious way and becomes this sort of shutdown response to things, \u201cThat\u2019s fake news,\u201d or whatever.", "Do you have anything to do about it? You have CNN doing things, you\u2019ve got other ... It\u2019s not just newspapers and print organizations but it\u2019s also broadcast networks and other stuff.", "Actually, we have a whole public education campaign called Support Real News where we\u2019re out trying to ...", "Is news literacy enough anymore? Is there enough news literacy?", "That\u2019s a really good question.", "[Walt] Mossberg is ", "working on this", ".", "It\u2019s really important, but understand, in the internet environment, for the reasons I talked about before, we put a big burden on users.", "Absolutely.", "Much more than ever in the past.", "Right.", "The answer can\u2019t be we\u2019ll just keep educating these people while we shove garbage at them constantly. That can\u2019t be the ... You\u2019re never gonna have enough news literacy to overwhelm the garbage.", "Yeah.", "You need a system that rewards the delivery of good, high-quality content. And yes, have news literacy but also have the responsibility in the platforms about what they deliver and to who.", "All right, I wanna finish up talking about the ownership by all these internet zillionaires. You\u2019ve got Marc Benioff, you\u2019ve got Jeff Bezos from Amazon owning the Washington Post, you\u2019ve got Marc buying Time. You have Laurene Powell Jobs buying things. Talk about that. There\u2019s more, there\u2019s more rumors. There\u2019s a rumor ... Ev Williams buying things. You have Medium, Ev Williams from Twitter doing Medium. How do you look at all this?", "There have always been rich families owning media.", "Yes, there are. Indeed.", "That\u2019s actually not necessarily a new thing.", "Bancrofts. Those Kentucky people.", "I think you\u2019ve got examples of where it\u2019s really worked well.", "The Grahams.", "Look at the Washington Post.", "Yes.", "Where they really make investments ...", "This is Bezos.", "Yeah, and invest for the long term.", "Mm-hmm.", "Look what\u2019s happened in LA, Dr. [Patrick] Soon-Shiong is doing some great investments.", "Couldn\u2019t get worse there, could it? It\u2019s literally the worst.", "That\u2019s one kind of owner I have in this industry. What I\u2019m very careful to say is, listen, let\u2019s not wait to be rescued by the billionaires.", "Right. \u201cThat\u2019s not my policy!\u201d", "First of all, again, you still have to make it sustainable. This idea that billionaires are gonna keep writing checks to fund losses at something, that\u2019s not the billionaires I\u2019ve run into over time.", "Right.", "They can provide long-term strategic support, really carry things through, but that underlying business still has to pay for itself.", "Why do you think they\u2019re doing it? You ever think about it? Because it\u2019s either hedge funds or internet billionaires doing this. It\u2019s a really interesting ... There\u2019s not some new ... Well, I guess Patrick, no, he\u2019s a tech person.", "He\u2019s a tech guy. I think they\u2019re doing it out of, for the most part, a real civic sense, because I don\u2019t think the billionaires anyway are doing it to make money. I think they care about journalism. They very much care about their communities. Note that you don\u2019t have millionaires buying chains. They tend to buy in some locality that they care about.", "I think usually it comes out of a good civic sense. There\u2019s relatively few examples of somebody trying to drive coverage one way or the other. There\u2019s other things and I think that\u2019s a fine model, but again, it\u2019s gotta pay for itself.", "Right.", "We gotta solve these business structural issues because the billionaires are not gonna save us, believe it or not.", "You\u2019re kidding. They think they are. They don\u2019t wanna be taxed, that\u2019s for sure.", "They\u2019re post-tax.", "I literally posted why the Elizabeth Warren thing was a good explainer and ahh, they went crazy. Oh man. Sometimes I\u2019m like, \u201cHow rich can you be?\u201d \u201c", "There\u2019s not gonna be innovation!\u201d", " I\u2019m like, I\u2019m certain there\u2019s gonna be innovation whether you have another billion dollars or not. That\u2019s my guess.", "Again, all your political figures now are talking about we need the power of philanthropy to save journalism. Listen, philanthropy is fine and good. Yay. But that can\u2019t be shorthand for oh, by the way, there\u2019s no business here.", "Right. What do you think the big businesses should be, if you think about them, let\u2019s finish up talking about them. What is promising? Give me two or three examples of what you think is promising. Subscriptions, what?", "Oh, subscriptions, definitely. I think that\u2019s a way ...", "Podcasts.", "Podcasts. It\u2019s super lucrative, I\u2019ve heard.", "They are. Shh, no it\u2019s not. It\u2019s the worst business ever. Don\u2019t get into it.", "Subscription is where everybody is focused on. We do need actually more technical solutions for journalism. If I could digress a minute ...", "Sure.", "If you talk to anybody in tech, they always like models from something else that works. Uber for X, right? Uber for dog walking. There\u2019s this mental model. When it comes to content, they always say Spotify for, right? Spotify for news.", "Interesting ideas, but micropayments is the other one. A couple things to keep in mind when news is compared to music, though. First of all, our back catalog is not super valuable. You may have listened to Ella Fitzgerald this morning but something tells me you didn\u2019t read about Jimmy Carter.", "No.", "We\u2019re one-time-only consumption. You usually don\u2019t read news articles over and over again.", "You do not.", "And trust. The biggest one is, trust is a huge part of the transaction. You have to know where it\u2019s coming from and have some trust in who developed it. As long as it sounds like Ella Fitzgerald, you\u2019re kinda pretty okay.", "Right. That\u2019s a good point.", "We\u2019re gonna need technical solutions. You can\u2019t just say Spotify for news unless it really invests in this trust component and builds that attachment to the brand. All these ideas that disintermediate people from the brand are disasters.", "Right, I\u2019d agree with you. Are you positive or negative, or how are you feeling about your job?", "Oh, positive. More people consume our stuff than ever, like millennials.", "They do. I think it\u2019s crap that they need it in little bits or snackable.", "No. Actually, if you do data around this, the thing people value most is big, deep, enterprise, data.", "100 percent.", "That\u2019s really what they value. And millennials consume much more than we did at that age because they can. It\u2019s available easily.", "Right, in lots of ways. That\u2019s the difference is understanding lots of ways and reaching people lots of ways. That\u2019s the one thing that a lot of traditional news sources these days don\u2019t get. They stick with just print or something like that.", "Now, you get people where they are but it turns out people are much more available than they ever were before.", "Absolutely.", "My kids consume tons of news.", "When I started this podcast four or five years ago, something like that, so many people in traditional news sources were like, \u201cYou know millennials don\u2019t wanna listen for an hour.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cYes, they do,\u201d and they\u2019re like, \u201cNo, they don\u2019t.

There was certainly a lot of prompts that came from my own experiences, but I also interviewed over 100 different folks for this book.", "Yeah, so this was a journalistic project, in some ways. You were certainly using your relationships, but able to kind of ...", "I was trying.", "To, you know, put people on the couch and ask about what their life was like. So, just start off with ... Most folks don\u2019t know who you are. How did you end up ... Let me ask this. What was your first Silicon Valley experience? I think you were at Goldman after college for a couple of years?", "Yeah. I studied design and business as an undergrad, and had to kind of decide which path to choose. This is 2001, 2002, and at that time you kind of cut your teeth in business if you wanted to, or went the design route. And so I went to, of all places, a job on Wall Street, where a year and a half into it I was just very ... It was very clear to me I didn\u2019t want to be in finance for the rest of my life. And then went to my manager, talked about it. She said, \u201cWell, if you could have another job in the firm, what would it be?\u201d I ended up taking this role in the executive office, focused on organizational development, leadership development, succession planning.

This is hundreds of billions of dollars of creative production annually, done by people who are ultimately represented by agencies and headhunters. They never get attribution for their work.\u201d And they were using, at the time, DeviantArt and Myspace and some of these other products to showcase their work online, and I thought there was an opportunity there.

So you never thought about joining a massive design firm, or kind of going into the design world full-time, professionally? That was never something you ...", "Not really.

And again, I went to school with a lot of folks who became designers and I had a lot of friends in this community, and I felt they were some of the most talented, yet disorganized, people I knew. And I figured, you know, they always go to conferences and read books about creativity and design. That\u2019s actually the last thing they need. They don\u2019t need more ideas. They need more execution. They just need to have a better system for how they showcase their work and keep their portfolios updated. And so, the idea behind Behance was a company to organize the creative world, as opposed to boost productivity or creativity or connect people with each other. ", "That was always one of those principles of the company was we\u2019re not gonna use the word \u201ccreativity.\u201d We\u2019re actually always gonna focus on organizing and boosting productivity in the creative world. And that started, of all things, as a paper product.", "Paper. That\u2019s like the white, eight-and-a-half by 11?", "Yeah. We actually made notebooks for creatives to get organized. There\u2019s a funny story we can get to later, the fact that one of our partners of Behance was Garrett Camp, who had just bought back StumbleUpon, and he was ...", "Yup. This is, later, the founder of Uber.", "Right, and he was using our action books for his own work. I was actually in a meeting a few years later where he whipped out a little sketch of a little side project of his to get cars on demand. And it was one of our action books that he was showing me this idea that became Uber.", "Okay. There you go. So you guys didn\u2019t, you guys were ... Just, you were very tapped in at that point to the New York creative scene. You don\u2019t raise any money, right? You were using the word startup. This was a startup at the time.", "So, we were bootstrapped. I mean, this is back in ...", "Okay, so maybe you just thought of it as, like, a company?", "What smart VC would invest in a company that\u2019s doing a paper product and has a conference to bootstrap themselves and has this idea of building a massive online network yet doesn\u2019t have any experienced engineers on their team that have done such a thing?", "So, were you bootstrapped intentionally, or was it that you were pitching and people were saying no? What was the experience there?", "We weren\u2019t pitching. Maybe it was partly because I knew what the answer would be.", "Okay.", "We were resolute on being a bootstrapped company that could actually choose its own destiny. And always in the back of my head I was wondering during that five-year period, \u201cMaybe we\u2019ll go solo.\u201d You know? ", "I knew Jason Fried and those guys, and I kind of looked up to the way that BaseCamp had been built, and I thought, \u201cMaybe we can kind of own our own destiny here and be somewhat a lifestyle business.\u201d And in fact, we were set up as an LLC, where everyone had compensatory units and could be compensated based on profits. And so, we had that going for a period of time, up until a moment where I realized I was strangling the potential of the team.", "Bootstrapping, by the way, is just a company without venture funding.", "Correct.", "So then, you guys eventually take some money from Benchmark, right? Is that the ...", "No, from Union Square Ventures.", "Okay. It\u2019s not from Benchmark, okay. How soon was that, in between that and the company being sold?", "Yeah, so it was actually, it all happened pretty quickly. Five years in, we raise a round from Union Square Ventures, Chris Dixon, Jeff Bezos, a few other angels, and then we\u2019re off to the races.", "Regular angels, like Jeff Bezos. You know, making angel investments all the time.", "We got lucky on ... And then these ... You know, small, syndicated folks, we probably raised probably around $6 million, but we had not really raised any venture funding before, so it was kind of our first round, but also an A. ", "And then, the long story short, about a year later, it just became very clear, after Adobe had made this transition from software to services, it needed to build a community to build the relationships with their customers, of which they didn\u2019t have, really ... You know, it used to be you\u2019d fill out this postcard and send it in if you bought a boxed software. Now you were, on a monthly basis, having a relationship with a company. ", "So, it just became clear to me that we were the perfect fit, and the opportunity was right, and we had so little dilution. And I figured, \u201cOkay. Are we gonna raise a series B and then a series C?\u201d I kind of did the math on that part of the outcome, and then I also thought about ... For our customers, and for the team, where did we belong, and where would be the best sort of mothership, so to speak?", "Yeah. You sold it for, like, I think 150-ish, right?", "Yup.", "And then you spent a couple years in round one in Adobe.", "Yeah, so three years. ", "Okay. This is round one.", "And I went in saying, \u201cI\u2019m not sure how this is gonna go.\u201d At first I was overseeing just Behance and the integration. And then I really started to get excited by this promise of Creative Cloud, which was really, at the time, a business model innovation as opposed to a series of product innovations. ", "But I was thinking, \u201cYou know, if we\u2019re actually delivering updates every month, as opposed to every 18 months, and we have these services that we can build ... \u201c Like, what does that really mean? And at the time, Dave Wadhwani was head of the Creative Cloud business. He went on to become CEO of AppDynamics. You know, right before ...", "Sure.", "And then they ended up almost going public, and then getting acquired. But he was my boss at the time and he said, \u201cWell, what do you want to do here?\u201d And I figured, \u201cWell, let\u2019s start to build some of these services and mobile products.\u201d So that was kind of my second job at Adobe, beyond Behance, during my first three years there.", "Got it. And so, then you had this really interesting part of your career, which was very public in some ways, which was the joining of Benchmark. Right?", "Mm-hmm.", "So, Benchmark. Obviously one of the most well-known venture capital firms. Hire people pretty rarely. Very small, very tight-knit.", "Yup.", "You joined when? From Adobe? Straight there from ...", "Yeah. So, I think ... You know, I learned a lot about myself in this process.", "At this point, you are a well-known seed investor, kind of on the side. This is not your full-time job.", "Right. So, all along the way, being at the intersection of design and technology. My role with Behance, being in the right place and some of the right times, like the story with Garrett.", "Yup.", "And working closely with people like Ben Silverman, you know, from the seed stage of Pinterest, and working with Kayvon and Joe from Periscope, and going through, with them, the acquisition into Twitter ... That\u2019s actually how I originally met Peter Fenton. And so, having this role with a number of different entrepreneurs, I became convinced that I should be an investor. ", "It\u2019s one of those things where everyone\u2019s telling you, \u201cThis is what you should do next. You should do this next.\u201d You start to believe it, potentially, if you don\u2019t know this part of yourself yet. And I always love working with product teams and investing in the potential of a product and the potential of people. And then I said, \u201cWell, if I love doing this, and I think I\u2019m pretty good as an investor, I should just join a great firm.\u201d And so, the opportunity to join Benchmark and spend a lot of time with that team, you know, it just seemed like the perfect fit. ", "And then, I think pretty quickly, I realized, or I felt like I had hung up my spurs, and it just wasn\u2019t the application of my own superpowers. You know? Everyone has to feel like, where are they in their zone most, and I just realized I love the earlier stage of working with products and helping sort of develop product strategy. And I think that from an operator\u2019s standpoint, that means that I should be building products, and from an investor\u2019s standpoint, that means I should really be in the seed stage.", "Yup.", "So then I found myself in this kind of awkward position where, you know, \u201cDo I want to do this for the next 15 years?\u201d \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s a major commitment \u2014 \u201cor not?\u201d And I think with my partners, the question was, what\u2019s the right fit for me and what should I be doing? And that\u2019s when, six or so months in, I made that transition to venture partner, and then figured ... Which I remain to this day. ", "But then, went back and said, \u201cOkay. Well, where am I most happy and where do I feel fully utilized?\u201d And to me, there was no question. My perfect balance is building products and solving product problems, and working with early-stage teams to find their product market fit.", "Right. That was very unusual, though. Right? I mean, obviously in Silicon Valley, people join these venture firms, especially august ones like Benchmark, and it\u2019s seen as, like, \u201cyou made it\u201d sort of career moves.", "Yeah, it\u2019s hard. And it also makes you wonder, like, \u201cGosh.\u201d You know? I had never really had a moment in my career until that point where I felt like I had made the wrong decision, or that I sort of failed, and how I felt I would take the next 10-plus years of my life. And so, it\u2019s hard not only to extract yourself from a decision you\u2019ve made, but also to keep the relationships strong.", "Yeah, right.", "And then, also figure out what you want to do next after that point. Because, as you know, when you join a big venture firm like this, you\u2019re suddenly labeled as, \u201cYou\u2019re a VC. This is what you\u2019re gonna do forever.\u201d And I was ...", "Venture people are almost sort of famous in Silicon Valley, right?", "That was difficult. Right. And then of course, the headlines don\u2019t always help in this regard.", "Sure.", "But I think what I learned from that period, and I certainly ... You know, this had an influence on some parts of the book, as well. First of all, life is iteration, right? ", "Yeah.", "Trying to do things. And should I be beating myself up for taking a step, just because everyone says this was what I should do, as opposed to really validating that myself? You know, I think I certainly learned something from it. But at the end of the day, I also learned a ton from being a full-time part of the Benchmark team for over six months, and having these ongoing relationships with the firm that I do now. So, it\u2019s hard to have regrets.", "Yeah, and we talked about the role of external pressure, which, I think, it sounds like part of it is listening to other people.", "Yeah.", "That\u2019s something that entrepreneurs think about. Very quickly ... Just as of, what? Six months ago? 10 months ago? You\u2019re now back at Adobe for round two. How\u2019d that happen?", "Yeah. You know, rotating into this venture partner role, I started to kind of stick my finger into many different things. And one of those things was serving as a consultant for Shantanu, who\u2019s the CEO of Adobe. He knew me, obviously, very well, from my first three years there, and was very excited about some of the prospects for the creative products. ", "I mean, the company\u2019s been doing extraordinarily well, but I think the products are starting to reach an inflection point now where they can transcend the desktop and actually legitimately be multi-surface systems, and also, there\u2019s a market expansion opportunity now. ", "Adobe has a great reach to the creative professional world, but these days everyone wants to be creative and express themselves visually. Social marketing teams want to be able to output professional-grade creativity. The YouTube generation wants to be able to cut professional-grade video without having to learn a tool like Premiere Pro, which is pretty complicated. And so there were just these various inflection points and he asked me to come in and work with the teams a little bit, which I did. And I didn\u2019t really have in my mind that I would come back. I, in some ways, severed the umbilical cord to my own company. ", "\u201cNever again at Adobe.\u201d", "Oh, it was 10 years from start to finish at Behance and Adobe. That era of my life, even though I actually really enjoyed it, I just said, \u201cOkay, it\u2019s time to move on.\u201d But when he started to socialize this notion of a chief product officer role and what that could entail in terms of bringing design and product and engineering together and starting to cut through a lot of the decisions that should have been made but weren\u2019t, what I like to call it organizational debt, I thought it was a really interesting thing that I thought I was the right person to do. And the fact that they were willing to allow me to continue to do my noncompetitive seed investing and have this venture partner role and continue this book project, I think that I really appreciated that about the company\u2019s flexibility. ", "Let\u2019s talk a little bit about the bones of the book here. We were talking before about, you seem to have taken incredible notes. I\u2019m always amazed whenever I read some book from ... It makes me think I\u2019m not taking enough notes in my life. Though maybe it will be easier with email drafts and ... But you read all these political books and it\u2019s basically like people have contemporaneous notes of meetings with Nixon. ", "But you have these great anecdotes from various parts of your life, also have done some interviews. I\u2019d love to just hear how you tackle this. I know this has been a book that you\u2019ve been thinking about writing for a while. Obviously, when you start signing up with professional people in the book industry, it puts fire under your ass a little bit.", "Yep. ", "How did this come together? ", "About five to seven years ago, I started an Evernote file called \u201cA Journey In Between Insights.\u201d That\u2019s what I called it at the time.", "This is on Evernote. This is not, it\u2019s not note cards that are like stuffed in between ... ", "That is correct. It\u2019s an Evernote notebook, I guess. And whenever I would find myself on a phone call with an entrepreneur at 1:00 a.m. making a very bold and gut-wrenching decision, or find myself in a board meeting, or found myself in an interesting moment, whether it was as an entrepreneur or post-acquisition, big company or in a venture pitch, right? When there was something that I would think about that was somewhat counterintuitive that I wanted to think about more, I would just write it down. And then I would come back to them oftentimes. ", "It was just a way of me processing my own set of tactics and prompts that were relevant to me and I would want to share with other entrepreneurs and that sort of thing. And this book, this notebook over the years, amassed over 800 or so notes. I know I was on a flight at one point a few years ago and said, \u201cI should just start to actually tag them. Figure out if there\u2019s some theme.\u201d", "At this point you\u2019re not thinking about it as a book, you\u2019re thinking about as observation.", "Yeah, sort of personal way. ", "It\u2019s almost like things you wish you could tweet.", "Yeah, and some of them I would tweet occasionally. So I went through and I realized that there was actually an interesting theme amongst them. First of all, they were all about, generally, navigating the volatility between the start and the finish. And I\u2019ve always been frustrated by our obsession with headlines, no offense. ", "No, no. ", "Right? ", "That\u2019s fair, yeah.", "But the starts. We love to celebrate when people leave and start something new or people get funding and then we love celebrating whether it\u2019s an acquisition, an IPO or a bankruptcy. We love the pithy starts and finishes, and then there\u2019s volatility in between, it\u2019s very hard to tie a bow around. It\u2019s a little too dynamic to be summarized, and therefore basically goes overlooked. ", "The fascination for me was, all of these insights essentially relate to volatility and they really fall into three camps: During the lows, optimizing whatever is working, and then that final mile, how to not screw it up. ", "Yup. So let\u2019s talk a little bit about each of those. I totally agree. Obviously, people, not just the press but observers, right? If you\u2019re an entrepreneur and you have a friend who is another entrepreneur, it\u2019s like, \u201cOh, you started the company, great.\u201d And then like, \u201cOh, how\u2019d the company go?\u201d And obviously in terms of the actual hours spent, most of it is just grinding away.", "Totally.", "Things are on fire or slightly better. But I guess people would say, \u201cYeah, he\u2019s doing his job. How\u2019s it going?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s still going on.\u201d ", "Right, right.", "Move on. So the beginnings. Do you feel like the way that people begin companies these days is ... What\u2019s the lesson in this book for people who are thinking about beginning companies?", "Yeah. Well, a few different things. I think that when you embark on a bold project that is likely to span the course of years, right? A few things. First of all, there are too many companies, especially in Silicon Valley, that are started out of a passion for a solution to a problem, as opposed to empathy with the customer suffering the problem. I actually think a lot of work ...", "\u201cI want to do x because I\u2019m interested in x,\u201d rather than someone else ... ", "Yeah.", "Someone else, people care about ...", "There needs to be a better this, there needs to be a better that, or the world suffers from this and I\u2019m going to solve it. And then we embark and build a team of people who are passionate about the market opportunity in the solution. And then you end up with something ...", "It\u2019s kind of like a hero complex. ", "It is a bit and you end up with something that\u2019s typically at least, if not more, 30 degrees off what the customer ultimately needs. The really mundane yet critical thing to do in this process, of course, is to be shoulder to shoulder with the customer suffering. Which is why a lot of the best teams in the early stages are not building scalable solutions yet, they\u2019re just building something that ", "really", " hits the nail on the head for the customer. And then once you figure that out in a non-scalable fashion, then you start to think, \u201cOkay, how do we do this in a way that might be, dare I say, profitable in the future?\u201d So I think that the the empathy-before-passion piece...", "I also think that we typically fool ourselves into thinking that the vision for what this might be five years from now is enough to keep the team engaged on an everyday basis. And I talk about, in the book, this notion of short circuiting your reward system so that the stuff that you typically rely upon for progress indication, like revenues and customers, when that stuff isn\u2019t there, how do you keep people engaged? I would go on the record saying I think the competitive advantage of most startups is just sticking together long enough to figure it out.", "Right. Just not giving up.", "Especially hard, by the way, in Silicon Valley with all these headlines of companies that seemingly are doing better than you are. And you\u2019re constantly questioning, should I be here? I\u2019ve been heads down, grinding for two years, seems like we\u2019re not making any traction. And so-and-so just raised $30 million from this company. What am I doing wrong? And that\u2019s one of the disadvantages, I believe, of being in a hot spot, is that your loyalty and the collective perseverance of a team is at risk at all times. ", "Yes, totally. And then in the middle stage, which is the whole point of the book. ", "Yeah. ", "Do you think that too many people are ... I think that the value of the book here is the fact that if there\u2019s an entrepreneur out there who is going through a messy middle, they probably think, \u201cI screwed up,\u201d right? Like things aren\u2019t getting better. And the whole point of the book here, it seems to me, is that there\u2019s a way to ... That this is common. And this isn\u2019t just entrepreneurship or startups. Marriages have ups and downs, friendships have ups and downs.", "By the way, it\u2019s the best-case scenario. ", "Yeah. ", "The volatility, first of all is ... There is something to be mined from this volatility. It\u2019s \u2014 at its lows is where we build the muscle memory. I like to say that resourcefulness is more important than resources, and you only get resourcefulness from having to be constrained. ", "And when I think about Joe Gebbia and the team at Airbnb and their two iterations before the third that worked, or I think about Ben Silbermann consistently being underestimated by the tech media and being discounted because a lot of his customers were middle-American moms in the beginning. And I think about, the teams that I actually most admire are those that have endured a lot of anonymity, ambiguity, uncertainty, and have in some ways mined those lows to build great process and great culture. ", "And I would just say that in this volatility, we\u2019re not our best selves at the lows, obviously, because we make decisions out of fear. We\u2019re not our best at the highs because we are making decisions, oftentimes falsely attributing the things that we did to the things that worked. And so the message of this middle part is to have tactics, to make the most and endure the lows and then optimize the hell out of anything that works. ", "Yeah. So the book is organized into these little five-page ... It\u2019s very easy to read even if you only had 10 minutes on the bus or something like that. ", "Yep. ", "What are some of your favorite lessons? My favorite one is the \u201cDo your fucking job\u201d one, which ...  Do you want to explain that?", "Yeah, sure. In the endurance section \u2014 which was the hardest part to write, by the way, it\u2019s painful to write ", "and", " read \u2014 it\u2019s just about the moments where you\u2019re not sure how to do something or where you are, where you\u2019re going. And it\u2019s actually the reality of anyone\u2019s journey. This is not particular to people that are not doing well. It\u2019s a part of any bold journey. ", "But the \u201cdo your fucking job\u201d piece is about what I and others that I interviewed do for themselves when they have to let someone off, lay someone off, or kill a product that\u2019s working but doesn\u2019t have the growth rate that is required to break out. And these are always the difficult decisions to make because the easiest decision to make is to not make a decision yet, but when you\u2019re just ... Sometimes you just have to whisper to yourself, \u201cjust do your fucking job.\u201d And then you liberate your team to be so much more productive and focused. ", "And so, how do you hold yourself accountable to doing that? What are the little tricks or hacks? And I would always, literally, whisper to myself \u201cDYFJ\u201d before some of these moments just so I could kick my ass. ", "Well, you need to be ... you need to be a cold, emotionless killer. ", "Yeah. I think that I also talk in the section about how the sensitivities we have to the people that we will impact with our decisions are good. This is what makes us effective leaders, is understanding how people will feel, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that decision shouldn\u2019t be made. Because by not making it, you contribute to that organizational debt, right? That accumulation of decisions that should have been made but weren\u2019t. And that\u2019s where you end up losing your A players who would rather work with a team where they can make the fricking decisions and move on. ", "Yeah. What\u2019s another one of your favorite lessons from the book?", "Well, I think that another one is a ... Gosh, there\u2019s a lot. It\u2019s breaking the long game down into chapters and I talk about how Ben did that at Pinterest. I talk about short-circuiting the reward system piece, which I mentioned earlier. I share a story about how in the early days of Behance, we would type in \u201cBehance\u201d to Google and it would always say, \u201cDo you mean enhance?\u201d \u201cDo you mean enhance?\u201d And it was like, \u201cDammit, we\u2019re a mistake.\u201d", "And actually it was good, because that was one of those near-term things we could optimize towards and feel progress. And so lo and behold, one day we typed in Behance, it actually said Behance. And then I think six months later, it was back in 2007, 2008, Beyonce became super popular and we lost our SEO again. So lots of little ...", "Startups are luck, right? ", "Lots of little funny things like that. And there are a bunch of things ... The last thing I would just say is, I equate this journey in the early stages with all the volatility, it\u2019s like a five- to 10-day road trip with the windows blocked out and your team in the back seat and they have no idea where the hell they are. And if you just keep driving, because you know where you\u2019re going, no one\u2019s going to be with you anymore, they\u2019re going to start to freak out. ", "But if you can narrate your team through the journey and merchandise progress to the team, manufacture wins along the way that are not fake wins but are celebratory milestones that matter but may have otherwise been ignored. There\u2019s this whole system of narration that leaders need to do for their team in the endurance stage. And a lot of folks don\u2019t do it because they\u2019re freaking out, themselves. And it\u2019s important. ", "Do you feel like this is something that ... What\u2019s the pitch here to someone who\u2019s listening, who\u2019s not in startups, not in tech?", "Oh my gosh, this applies ... I have some feedback from early readers. They\u2019re like, \u201cHey, if you substitute the word relationship for venture,\u201d or \u201cnew product in a company\u201d to \u201cventure,\u201d or \u201cbook project.\u201d I also did interview writers and artists for this book, as well, and I have a bunch of parallels for some of these other industries. Because in essence, anything bold enough has this volatility. Also, we\u2019re not hardwired for this stuff. The average life expectancy in the 17th century was 27 years old or something. ", "There was no messy middle. There\u2019s just life and death. ", "Well, I mean, the idea of spending five to 10 years on a project when life expectancy is so low is pretty unwise.", "It\u2019s very bold, though. So there you go. ", "It is bold, but we\u2019re fighting against our own human tendencies, as well as society\u2019s desire to kill off anything that\u2019s new and threatening. So there\u2019s a lot to be considered in any walk of life, for bold, creative pursuits. ", "You have been around a lot of really interesting startups really early. We talked a little about Pinterest, but I\u2019d love to hear the story about ... Probably the startup you\u2019re most closely identified with outside of yours is Uber. How did that happen? We\u2019ve talked before about Garrett Camp, who was the founder, one of the founders of Uber, but how did that relationship blossom? And you were a very early investor in it, presumably made a good amount of money on this. How did this relationship happen? ", "Garrett and I have known each other for many years and we\u2019re both product-minded investors and leaders, and when he had bought back StumbleUpon from eBay\u2026 I forget the exact date, it was probably in the 2007, 2009, whatever time frame. I was a bootstrapped, meaning no venture capital-backed company, Behance CEO, way overwhelmed with my own responsibilities. We were doing a few different partnerships between StumbleUpon and Behance at the time, because Behance content performed well in StumbleUpon, we were finding more ways to work together and become friends. ", "He was in New York in my office, which was also adjacent to my apartment. This is back in the day, and at the end of the meeting, he whips out some sketches of what he was thinking about as a mobile app to be able to get a car without having to call and book and wait for ... You know, schedule in advance. I remember my first thought being, \u201cYou gotta be kidding me. You just bought back StumbleUpon from eBay and you\u2019re thinking about launching a mobile app livery company? This isn\u2019t a good idea for you. I mean, literally, how do you handle that?\u201d ", "He was just tinkering with this, and I think he was also, of course, in the process of bringing together some folks to run this full-time so he could continue doing his job and maybe serve in some sort of founder and chairman-type role.", "Right. And how involved were you in the early days?", "In the early days, we would just talk about product, so he would pitch, we\u2019d talk about ... I remember one story, which I talk about a little bit in the book, because I had learned from him around this was this importance of narrating or developing the brand and the message ", "before", " the product. Because one of the earliest things I remember him talking about was the distinction between a brand that everyone aspired for, as opposed to one that felt accessible. So there was this question of, is it \u201ceveryone\u2019s personal driver,\u201d which is aspirational, or is it more like a \u201ctaxis on-demand,\u201d which is an accessible ...", "You\u2019re talking about what is the slogan, essentially, right?", "Yeah. Well, slogan, but also, it informs the design. The brand itself, is it sleek and seems expensive, or does it seem affordable and accessible?", "Right. \u201cEveryone\u2019s personal driver\u201d sounds like, \u201cWhy do I need a personal driver? I make 60K a year.\u201d", "Yeah. I think that the idea of ... They actually ended up going with the everyone\u2019s personal driver as a way to make people want to aspire to have something that they wouldn\u2019t ordinarily have been able to have.", "I feel like that\u2019s not very active in the branding now, but ...", "I think it\u2019s probably evolved, for sure, but it\u2019s actually another thing to think about, is that the right playbook at one time in the business can become the absolute wrong playbook at another time in the business. Both from how it\u2019s led, as well as what the brand and the message should be and whatever else. ", "I think that the decision to make an aspirational brand to start probably got the right first adopters, and then launched it in the right way. ", "Yep. So then, another one is Pinterest. ", "Yeah, so Pinterest ...", "I\u2019m sure that your background, obviously, in design helped.", "Yeah, Ben couldn\u2019t raise his seed round on the west coast, so he resorted to coming to the east coast. ", "Had to do with the Scott Belsky\u2019s of New York rather than the real people.", "I mean, the riffraff! And Pinterest was a grid-based design system. And it was extraordinarily visual and that was very much what Behance was at the time. And so that\u2019s how we connected. And Ben has always had a drive towards engaging designers in his products. And what I also noticed when I first met Ben, even though they were just kind of testing an early version of Pinterest at the time, they just rotated from a previous incarnation of the business.", "I noticed while the traffic was very low to Behance, it was like a high-growth low number. And I remember being curious about some of the decisions that Ben had made. Like, for example, this is at a time when bookmarking sites like Delicious didn\u2019t even have visuals. And any other website that had visuals like Tumblr and others, when you click on an image, it would bring you within the site, because it was always an optimization for pageviews. Everyone on the web was optimizing for pageviews. You wanted to keep the customer in. ", "And what Ben did was the opposite. When you click on an image, you actually went out. You went to an external URL. Which, while it minimized their pageviews, which looked bad on paper to some investors and that\u2019s maybe why they had struggle raising money, but they were driving traffic. And so all of the recipients of this traffic, these click-throughs, were like, \u201cWhoa, what is this Pinterest thing?\u201d And that, of course, led to them incorporating \u201cpin\u201d buttons and all the other stuff.", "So I found that sort of contrarian view of developing a web product at the time very interesting.

I feel like I still see your name on lots of stuff.", "Listen, I get to meet a lot of folks now that are doing things that overlap ... Overly value product design and are looking to build design teams and product teams. And when different firms introduce me to companies that they\u2019re excited about, if I really resonate with the product and the vision, then I\u2019ll participate as an investor. And I do try to save some time every week to meet with entrepreneurs because it keeps me on my toes, it helps me understand, also, how they\u2019re designing their products. ", "I have products like Adobe XD now that I\u2019m aggressively trying to help meet the market\u2019s needs. And to be able to work with the most forward-thinking design product teams is really helpful in my day job, and it keeps me on my toes and it feeds another appetite that I have.

You hear this from some consumer investors who feel like ...", "It\u2019s a lazy comment that they make.", "It is a mainstream comment, though. It sounds like you think it\u2019s lazy.", "I think that whenever we start to discount the probability of something extraordinary going on, is when you find something extraordinary going on. So I love when folks are discounting the consumer sector or discounting the whole world of direct-to-consumer brands as non-venture bankable or ... To me, that\u2019s an example of where people are starting to get lazy, and they\u2019re starting to generalize. So that gets me curious. ", "The thing about traditional venture capital is it\u2019s transactional. You\u2019re always trying to get ahead of traction. And so you can\u2019t help but always be bringing in all the data around you of what people are saying is getting traction and not getting traction. It makes you very tilted on the world before you.", "I always find that great investors really tune in to certain curiosities that they have that others don\u2019t. And then through that insatiable curiosity about a topic or an area of opportunity, end up asking the right questions and finding the right opportunities.", "Is there anything about the startup world ... I know a lot of your book is about what individual leaders should do differently. Is there anything about the startup world, having done this ... You\u2019re somewhat of an old guard, even though you\u2019re not that old, in the seed investment world at least. But what would you change? If you were in charge of designing the way that startups raise money or operate ...", "Oh man, where do I get started here?", "Softball headed up.", "Yeah, there\u2019s a few different... They range in the spectrum from somewhat obvious to maybe a little bit polarizing in terms of my ideas on that front. But it goes without saying that the abundance of capital feeds laziness on all sides of the spectrum. From... The LPs become less discriminant where they put their money.", "LPs are the investors, venture capital funds own investors who have endowments, hospitals, stuff like that.", "Right. And then the venture capitalists and their intern have too much money, and they start to be a little less discerning. And then companies figure, \u201cSince I can raise the money, I should raise the money.\u201d And here\u2019s the tricky part: Sometimes that\u2019s right. I know Stewart Butterfield\u2019s come on record saying, \u201cHey, I\u2019m going to raise money for Slack at this foundation because I can.\u201d And with his velocity of a company that makes sense for him.", "But I don\u2019t think it makes sense for most folks because then, that\u2019s the whole ... You have resources as carbs and resourcefulness as muscle. You\u2019re going to just throw carbs at every problem and you\u2019re not going to end up having anything ...", "The carbs were really good though, that\u2019s the thing.", "They taste so good at the time and they really make your problems go away for a moment. But not over time.", "So I think that there\u2019s constraints in the system that I would love to see. And I advise companies to not get ahead of themselves. Because I have seen so many businesses that I\u2019ve invested in that haven\u2019t done as well, go out after a big seed or A round. And then have to do either an even-money or down round, and then their employees get this message that the last two years have been for nothing and investors start to demand more aggressive terms. And it\u2019s sort of the beginning of the end in many cases. So that\u2019s one thing.", "And the other thing I would say is, it would be interesting here on the bold idea side...", "Yeah. What\u2019s the most polarizing opinion possible?", "We always have the SAFE notes and standard ways that companies raise money, whether it\u2019s a convertible note or equity. But there\u2019s no standardized way of companies returning capital and saying, \u201cOkay, this isn\u2019t working.\u201d", "I\u2019ve been in some companies that started as a big data play and became an online car-sales thing and then switched to a third thing. And as an investor I\u2019m just like, \u201cI didn\u2019t invest in the second ", "or", " the third incarnation of what you\u2019re doing. And you\u2019re just kind of using the money at this point to triangulate in the ether.\u201d", "What if there was a way for companies to be able to, at some point say, \u201cHey, I\u2019m just going to push the eject button because this isn\u2019t working.\u201d And then have a agreed-upon way that capital resolves all debts, maybe compensates the founders a little bit and just lets everyone go on their merry way as opposed to stringing out a long, painful, 10-year death journey.", "Especially because you can be in there for a very long time. You invest in 2012, in 2018 the company\u2019s pivoted four times, the founders are ...", "And founders struggle with this.

And I\u2019m like, \u201cWell, if you have less conviction now then you did when you knew nothing, then eject.\u201d", "But there\u2019s no standard way of winding that down and returning, without questions asked. And it would just be interesting if it was more commonplace and accepted for the eject button, and for an actual incentives in that instance, that sort of take care of everyone at that moment.", "That is very controversial, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s entirely a financial question as much as it is people don\u2019t want to say they failed at it, right? And financially, yeah, you can certainly come up with a structure where... That\u2019s why shareholders will sometimes sell their shares in the secondary, or find some other way to eject.", "But most of it\u2019s basically ...

Your Google equity.", "Google equity, right.", "But if it doesn\u2019t work you just kind of pick up where you left off at Google. And so I think it was their way of saying, \u201cHey, these top people want to leave and start their thing, and we know that most of those things don\u2019t end well. And the cost of recruiters and getting a Google employee that will perform really well is so high, we\u2019ll just write these term sheets to people and have these conditions and keep their equity vesting, so that they feel like this opportunity to just come right back in if it\u2019s not working.\u201d", "It\u2019s interesting, because actually ...", "Google is sort of betting on the person\u2019s going to fail.", "Well actually, it\u2019s funny, I was hearing this and I was thinking, \u201cOh, actually, this is super smart of Google.\u201d Because it also gives the entrepreneurs this weird exit opportunity that in two years, if it\u2019s not working, they can just kind of go back and pick up where they left off.", "Save face and go back.", "Which is not a healthy dynamic for a startup.

So, how\u2019s it going?", "Christopher Payne: ", "Thanks for having us.", "How\u2019s it going in the delivery business? We got lots to talk about.", "Tony Xu: ", "Yes.", "So, I just want to sort of get a sense, why don\u2019t we start with you, Tony, where the company is now. There\u2019s been a lot of different stories. We\u2019ve written a bunch of stories about where it is right now. Why don\u2019t you give us an update of DoorDash?", "Tony Xu: ", "Sure. Well, DoorDash is on track to be the largest delivery platform in the U.S., and it really was the culmination of a lot of things we did when we founded the company, but 2018 kind of is when a lot of these things materialized. For starters, we 5X\u2019d our geography. We started the year in 600 cities. We\u2019re now live across 3,000 cities, and at some point in the next year we\u2019ll be serving over 75 percent of the U.S. households. We now serve 69 of the top 100 restaurants in America, which is ...", "These are the chains, the large-", "Tony Xu: ", "Yeah. A lot of them are the chains: Wendy\u2019s, Chipotle, Cheesecake Factory. That\u2019s more than all of our peers combined. We\u2019re starting to deliver other types of things. In 2016, we built our Drive platform, which lets stores deliver through their own apps and their own websites. So today, we deliver the vast majority of Walmart\u2019s groceries in about 500 stores, 70 markets in the U.S. So, a lot\u2019s happened.", "So, talk about the delivery business in general. I mean, there\u2019s a million competitors in this space. When you started in 2013, they were talking ... Google was sort of wandering around, Amazon, obviously, and others. So talk about your principal competitors right now in this space, because I think people are confused because Uber is involved, Uber Eats and things like that.", "Tony Xu: ", "Yeah. So, there\u2019s always been a lot of players. I mean, food is a big category, and I think the misunderstood thing about food is that it\u2019s actually largely still undelivered.", "Right. Meaning ... What does that mean?", "Tony Xu: ", "So, food, the restaurant business, will see about $800 billion in sales in 2017, 2018, and about 5 percent of that is delivered, but if you actually look in certain segments, like pizza, we all know pizza is delivered. Half of pizza sales actually are delivered, but non-pizza, it\u2019s a single-digit percentage number. So, we\u2019re still in the super, super early innings, and I think that\u2019s one of the things that\u2019s not well understood. It\u2019s gonna be the largest industry out there because we do it 20 times a ... We eat 20 times, at least, a week.", "Right, right.", "Tony Xu: ", "So, that\u2019s really still the state of affairs for the market, but in terms of the big players, I think you\u2019re seeing a couple of players rise to the top. We\u2019ve been the fastest growing for the past year, year and a half, growing now over 250 percent year on year.", "Mm-hmm. So, talk about the competitors. Try to name them. I know you can do it.", "Tony Xu: ", "Yeah.", "Chris, I\u2019ll let you do it if he doesn\u2019t want to.", "Tony Xu: ", "So, I think what you see is that there have been companies that started in the past, and most of these companies, whether they\u2019re the Grubhubs of the world, they\u2019re lead-generation companies. They didn\u2019t do the deliveries themselves. As a result, most of the market was actually not served. So, outside of New York City, nobody did delivery. That\u2019s the biggest thing. ", "What DoorDash has done is really allowed any one of the 250,000 restaurants that we serve today to offer that, and so that is a big part of why we\u2019re the No. 1 player.", "All right. I\u2019m gonna ask Chris, then. Competitors, let\u2019s talk about them individually. Google.", "Christopher Payne: ", "Yeah. Google\u2019s not really in the restaurant space at this point. They did Shopping Express a while back.", "Shopping Express, right.", "Christopher Payne: ", "It seems to be sort of ...", "Because you\u2019re all gonna converge on delivering everything, I presume.", "Christopher Payne: ", "Yeah, 100 percent. Our vision is definitely last-mile logistics, so we started with restaurant food delivery. We now do grocery with Walmart, and you\u2019ll see more expansion in the years to come.", "In that area, Amazon is the other competitor. How do you look at that?", "Christopher Payne: ", "Because we are a last-mile logistics platform and power, say, Walmart\u2019s deliveries, Amazon is a potential future ally, or they\u2019re a potential competitor. There is a service called Amazon Restaurants. It\u2019s very, very small today, sub 5 percent market share, so it doesn\u2019t seem to be a major initiative for them, but I hope to see them as an ally in the future because we\u2019re connecting all local businesses to all local consumers. That\u2019s the vision that Tony created, and we want to be able to deliver anything to anyone in real time.", "Right. So, talk about that, because I\u2019ve been doing a lot of this, using a lot of delivery services lately, most of them Amazon, actually, Prime Now and various things, testing the various ... Uber Eats and things like that. Talk about how it\u2019s ... I\u2019m trying to get people to understand how the business is moving, because there\u2019s lots of different parts, but eventually everyone\u2019s gonna converge on the same idea of whatever you want, whenever you want, however you want.", "Tony Xu: ", "Yeah. I mean, I think it\u2019s important to start with one of the earliest pioneers in this space, which was FedEx, back in 1972. Actually, many of the models that you talked about, whether it\u2019s the Amazons or other types of retailers, really still are predicated on that model, which is we go door to door to door and we make drop-offs, and we drive pretty much the same routes every day. It\u2019s the milk person\u2019s route. That largely hasn\u2019t changed in the last four decades. ", "However, that\u2019s not the way we shop. I personally don\u2019t know what I\u2019m gonna eat for dinner tonight. I don\u2019t know when I\u2019m gonna buy my next Coca-Cola can or pair of jeans. I\u2019m just gonna buy them when I need them, and I think most people do. So, there hasn\u2019t existed this local real-time service. If you think about it, companies like Amazon have certainly grown delivery of their own goods. There doesn\u2019t exist that system for all the businesses on the streets.", "Mm-hmm, and Amazon, presumably, is a competitor with them also, and they want another alternative to that, correct?", "Christopher Payne: ", "Competitor to ...", "To all these local businesses.", "Christopher Payne: ", "Yeah. I mean, I think that\u2019s right. I think one of the things we\u2019re trying to do is empower local businesses, and a lot of local businesses do not have the capability to deliver on their own. One of the things that started the company with Tony was going door to door, and he talked to merchants, and they were having to turn away business, catering business, because they couldn\u2019t deliver cookies, in this case.", "Right, right.", "Christopher Payne: ", "So, one way to think about this is DoorDash, we\u2019re trying to sort of allow the little business to compete with the big businesses.", "By providing a platform.", "Christopher Payne: ", "Yeah, by providing a platform that they couldn\u2019t build otherwise.", "All right. Let\u2019s talk a little bit about the founding. Tony, why don\u2019t you talk a little bit, because not everybody knows who you are. Explain, because there\u2019s a bunch of these services, but talk about how you decided to start it.", "Tony Xu: ", "Yeah. We started the company to really help small businesses, people like my mom. I grew up working out of my mom\u2019s restaurant as a dishwasher, and my mom\u2019s story is one where she came to this country, she wanted to be a doctor, but the U.S. didn\u2019t recognize her license because we immigrated from China. It was a different license, and we only had $250 in the bank, so we couldn\u2019t put her through school. ", "So, long story short, she had to work three different jobs, one of which was at a restaurant, to save up enough money to open up a medical clinic, which she did after 12 years, and she now still runs in her 19th year. So, we started the company wanting to help people like her, and we went to different businesses in the Bay Area, whether they were restaurants or cake shops or retailers, and a few of them would tell us how they would turn down 10 to 15 delivery orders a week, which was just absurd.", "Which is business, right.", "Tony Xu: ", "Yeah, it\u2019s a lot. I mean, 10 to 15 a week, and you\u2019re running a 400-square-feet, 800-square-feet shop, you\u2019re gonna go out of business. It\u2019s just a matter of when. It\u2019s not like delivery hasn\u2019t been done before, but in their defense, why is it that 99 percent of businesses don\u2019t deliver? Why is it that 85 percent of restaurants don\u2019t deliver? ", "So, my co-founders and I did some deliveries ourselves, and we figured out two things. One, it\u2019s impossible, basically, to have your own delivery fleet. You never have enough. If there\u2019s a spike, let\u2019s say Stanford throws a midterm or something like that, and on most nights, tonight\u2019s Tuesday, you\u2019re gonna have too many, and you can\u2019t just flex up and down to meet your demand.", "The second challenge is just the way that delivery systems are set up is that they\u2019re set up in routes. They\u2019re not set up to do things just in time, and that\u2019s why FedEx does not deliver to you on demand, and it\u2019s also why Amazon and others don\u2019t do that as well. So, we believed that there was this opportunity to help all these businesses effectively make the shift from selling you experiences, i.e., you\u2019re going into the store, to convenience, and they needed a business partner to help them. They needed a delivery network to help them. They need marketing to help them, and we plan on building all of the services for them.", "All right, and when you think about it, Chris, when you think about it ... Talk about your background a little bit. Now, you came from a whole bunch of different places.", "Christopher Payne: ", "Yeah.", "Yeah.", "Christopher Payne: ", "I\u2019ve been around about ... So, I was at Microsoft for a long time, 15 years, right out of college, and then I was at Amazon. I was one of the first GMs beyond books. Amazon was just a bookseller when I was there. I did a little startup that got sold to eBay, and I ended up running eBay North America, and then prior to joining DoorDash I did an ill-fated stint as the CEO of Tinder.", "Yes, yes. I remember your ill-fated stint. We\u2019ll go into that later.", "Christopher Payne: ", "I bet.", "Yeah. How\u2019d that go?", "Christopher Payne: ", "It went great.", "No match. It didn\u2019t match.", "Christopher Payne: ", "I was definitely a swipe left, no question.", "Swipe left. So, the conceptual idea, you had been working at Amazon just selling, just regular selling, and Amazon had not gotten ... Amazon had been essentially a retailer that used online services to do it.", "Christopher Payne: ", "Yeah. Amazon was a first-party retailer when I was there. We had just gone into third-party selling for the first time before I left.", "Right, which was a big move for them at the time.", "Christopher Payne: ", "Yeah. We bought a company called Junglee, which was a service in that area.", "Junglee, mm-hmm. Right. All right. So, when you think about the delivery space, because I think one of the things is a ton of money is going into it. You guys have raised how much total?", "Tony Xu: ", "Just under a billion.", "That\u2019s a lot of money.", "Tony Xu: ", "It\u2019s a lot of money.", "A lot of money. Explain why for regular people, because you\u2019re a proxy for a lot of these, a lot of these delivery ... some of which have not worked out at all. I wanna talk about why these don\u2019t work out, and what the funding environment for these things are like, and why they continue to put money into it.", "Tony Xu: ", "Yeah. It\u2019s actually kind of ironic because we share the same investors as Webvan. If you think about ...", "I\u2019ve read about Webvan.", "Tony Xu: ", "If you think about DoorDash\u2019s earliest investors, Andy Rachleff is a seed investor in DoorDash. He was an investor from Benchmark in Webvan. Sequoia Capital, John Doerr from Kleiner Perkins, all three of those investors were some of the original investors in Webvan, and we were lucky ...", "Explain Webvan, for people who don\u2019t know.", "Tony Xu: ", "Oh, sorry. Yeah. Webvan was a grocery delivery service in which they built these warehouses in cities, and they would put ...", "Louis...", "Tony Xu: ", "Yeah. It was a great team that would bring groceries to your home, and the root cause, at least when I saw some of the data, was that there wasn\u2019t enough demand. It was just too early, and actually, one of their cities was profitable. That was actually San Francisco at the time, but because there wasn\u2019t enough demand in other markets, and because they had invested so heavily in these warehouses, and time that with the downturn, it was difficult to raise further capital, and that\u2019s why the business shut down. ", "There also wasn\u2019t mobile. There wasn\u2019t a lot of things.", "Tony Xu: ", "Yeah.", "There wasn\u2019t a practice of doing it. There wasn\u2019t a ... People didn\u2019t get used to doing Uber the way ... People didn\u2019t get used to doing it in the way they order now.", "Tony Xu: ", "Yeah. I think there were at least three big things. The first is that there wasn\u2019t the consumer demand, and today, thanks to many different types of companies over the past decade and a half since Webvan\u2019s founding, have taught us how to shop online, for just about anything. ", "Second, to your point, there wasn\u2019t mobile, so there wasn\u2019t this ability to tap into this on-demand workforce, and the comment there is that there\u2019s also changes in the labor market. One of the things that\u2019s similar about the Dashers on the DoorDash platform that fulfill all the deliveries and the consumers is that they all value their time. As a result of that, they\u2019re picking and choosing their jobs wherever and whenever they live and work. ", "The final thing I would say here is that a lot of the merchants now are ready. They\u2019re ready to make this transition from selling experiences to also selling convenience, and I think this is the greatest business model change ...", "Experiences, you mean going into the restaurant?", "Tony Xu: ", "Going into the store, and ...", "Or store, or whatever.", "Tony Xu: ", "This is the biggest business model shift in commerce. Restaurants have three kinds of costs. They have people costs, they have food costs, and they have real estate costs. In the delivery business, they really only have food costs. They are not gonna add extra real estate. They don\u2019t even need to add extra help in the store until it gets really, really busy. So, the delivery business is really a great business model for most of these stores.", "And I think that restaurants are starting to get that. They\u2019re starting to see that from a lot of these national restaurants that are doing this for the first time. When we announced many of these delivery partnerships, this is the first time that a Wendy\u2019s or a Chipotle or a Cheesecake Factory have done delivery in almost 40, 50 years.", "Or ever. So, could you could talk about the operations of that? Because one of the things that you are doing is giving them ... At some point, Chipotle might wanna do that themselves or have their own business doing it, and one of the things you guys have done more than anyone is target these big chains.", "Christopher Payne: ", "Yes. Yeah. I spend a lot of my time, I would say personal time, working with the large restaurants, very demanding customers. One of the things we try to do is be excellent at that. You can imagine if you\u2019re a Cheesecake Factory on a Friday night and you layer in 20 percent more volume with DoorDash, if that doesn\u2019t integrate with your operations and go smoothly, it can be challenging. ", "So, that\u2019s one of the things we focus a lot of our energies on, is customizing the operation, integration with their point-of-sale system, getting the Dasher to the right place in the specific store. You can imagine the store at Union Square in San Francisco, if you\u2019ve ever seen the Cheesecake Factory ...", "Yes, it\u2019s way upstairs. Yeah.", "Christopher Payne: ", "... it\u2019s on top of the ... At times when it\u2019s super busy, we actually have a runner that goes downstairs and hands off the food to Dashers in their vehicles. That\u2019s the type of thing it takes to actually win them over, because a lot of these restaurants were not designed for delivery, and they weren\u2019t designed to have 30 percent more volume on a Friday night or a Saturday night. So, that\u2019s sort of where we, I think, have differentiated ourselves, and that\u2019s why the top merchants tend to partner with us.", "On the Chipotle question that you asked, Chipotle actually does its own delivery through its app, so if you download the Chipotle app, behind the scenes, that\u2019s DoorDash doing the delivery. They\u2019re also on DoorDash\u2019s application from a consumer perspective. If you were an employee at Chipotle, you wouldn\u2019t even know. There\u2019s just an on-demand order coming into the point of sale. They fulfill that to a DoorDash Dasher that comes into the door, and it goes well. ", "The business is so nascent. It\u2019s so early that the tide rises for everyone. When we run a promotion on DoorDash with Chipotle, they do more in-store. When they run a promotion in-store, we do more on DoorDash itself.", "But what would be the reason, again, why a large chain wouldn\u2019t do this themselves?", "Christopher Payne: ", "Well, I think the question is what do you mean by \u201cdo it themselves?\u201d", "Have their own delivery service.", "Christopher Payne: ", "Have their own application? Have their own website? That\u2019s our recommendation, is they should do both. They should be on DoorDash, ", "and", " they should have their own channels, and many do. Wingstop does. Chipotle does. Five Guys does. But many do not. Our pitch is you should do both. But the ability to build a last-mile logistics platform, a technology platform, is very, very challenging.", "That\u2019s what I wanna get to.", "Christopher Payne: ", "Yeah. I don\u2019t think many restaurants are going to be doing that. Some have. Panera has, and have done a great job with it, but that\u2019s the exception, not the rule, for the ...", "Why would they do that?", "Christopher Payne: ", "Yeah. So, first of all ... Oh, why did Panera do it?", "They wanna control the whole experience, presumably.", "Christopher Payne: ", "Yeah. I mean, I think they thought they had a system that could do it. They did it a little before sort of DoorDash got to critical mass. I\u2019m not sure whether in today\u2019s world where DoorDash exists, it\u2019s in 3,000 cities, if that would make sense to start from scratch. This is challenging. It\u2019s challenging software. ", "It\u2019s one of the reasons I joined the company. It\u2019s like, you have to predict every night in three-mile circles around the country how much food is gonna be needed in that, and so therefore, how many drivers are gonna be needed. Super challenging to do that, a very hard software problem, and then the thought of being able to balance supply across just your one store, it just doesn\u2019t work. It\u2019s why it\u2019s never gone beyond pizza, predominantly.", "Predominantly.", "Christopher Payne: ", "As an individual store thing, it doesn\u2019t work.", "One of the things I think people really don\u2019t understand is the economics of these things, how you guys make money. I would like to explain it. Explain, Tony, if you could, how you all work when you have these relationships. ", "Tony Xu: ", "Yeah. So, we collect money two ways. First, we collect a fee from consumers, so that\u2019s in the form of a delivery fee and sometimes a service fee. And the restaurants pay us a commission on the order. A percentage of the food. ", "Right, for your service of delivery?", "Tony Xu: ", "Yes. ", "Like it\u2019s your fee, essentially, of doing it. ", "Tony Xu: ", "Yes. ", "And then whatever they get on top of that is extra money that they would get from what they\u2019re selling?", "Tony Xu: ", "Yes.", "Right. So, when you get this much money, a billion dollars in investment, what are you doing with that money?", "Tony Xu: ", "Well, a few things. Number one, we have to go to all of these cities. And going to cities ...", "This is just in the U.S.?", "Tony Xu: ", "U.S. and Canada. ", "I meant North America. ", "Tony Xu: ", "Yeah, yeah, yeah. It\u2019s in North America today. Going to cities is expensive. We have to build a fleet, we have to sign up restaurants, which requires sales people. We have to hire people centrally, this is one of the hardest things that we do, which is we run a decentralized operation city by city, but we also have central teams. ", "Similar to Uber did, initially. ", "Tony Xu: ", "A bunch of teams. We have engineering centrally, we have marketing centrally, we have a few other things centrally. And so building out the fleet, city by city, marketing to get the business going in each one of those cities, it\u2019s almost like starting a new business every single time. ", "Yes. ", "Tony Xu: ", "And then there is the build-out of the central team, so hiring. Those are the biggest sources of investment. ", "All right. Talk a little bit about the economics of it, how you guys did this year in terms of doing that. Because one of the things you could beat on would be price with someone else under-pricing you, presumably. Like an Uber Eats coming in and trying to go to the same businesses, because they\u2019re trying to go to small businesses and they were already on the road with their cars. That would, to me, be your closest competitor. Maybe I\u2019m wrong, is that correct? Uber Eats, right now, I\u2019d assume.", "Tony Xu: ", "Yeah. I mean, I think if you look at where the U.S. is, there\u2019s two players gaining share. It\u2019s DoorDash and Uber. And DoorDash is growing 65 percent faster. ", "OK. I just got an earful from Dara Khosrowshahi, that\u2019s why, about how great Uber Eats is. ", "Tony Xu: ", "So I think you are seeing the field move towards a smaller number of players. ", "Meaning that there\u2019d be two or one, or what happens to the Grubhubs in the others? ", "Tony Xu: ", "Well, I think that\u2019s probably too early to say on the exact ...", "Caviar?", "Tony Xu: ", "Yeah. I think that\u2019s ... but I think if you look at how consumers are buying and where they\u2019re buying, it\u2019s really going to two players right now. ", "All right. And how do you look at that market then, when you look at a market of that, of how you compete against an Uber which has a fleet of cars that are already moving, they already have a fleet, essentially. ", "Tony Xu: ", "One of the things that\u2019s interesting about the Dashers is they\u2019re actually not the same people that deliver food and deliver people. ", "Right. ", "Tony Xu: ", "So the average Dasher on the platform is in their mid 20s. The average ride-sharing driver in your favorite service is early 40s. Forty percent of the Dashers are female; 15 percent roughly in ride-sharing are female. And that\u2019s for safety concerns. So first point is that they\u2019re actually not the same people. In fact, in most of the country, the overlap is less than 10 percent. ", "Which is good because finding qualified people to do this is difficult. ", "Tony Xu: ", "Yeah. And, well, one of the things that we found is ... so, the Dashers on the platform come to us in two groups, from universities and from retail. And most of these folks already have a full-time job, they\u2019re just trying to add to it. I think one of the things that\u2019s interesting about how labor is changing for the tens of millions of folks looking for flexible work is that you have to put yourself in the shoes of where are they coming from? And if you\u2019re in school, 80 percent of your efforts are focused on school-related stuff. And so you may have some time to look for a part-time gig. ", "If you\u2019re working in retail, the number of hours that you can now work has been dwindling over the last 10 hours, 10 years, excuse me. And so in retail now, you can work between 25 and 30 hours typically in any city. And so you\u2019re looking for this gig that\u2019s between 10 and 15 hours a week, but you need to pick those hours, because you already have something that\u2019s occupying the majority of your week. And so that\u2019s really that void that we fill. ", "And, Chris, when you\u2019re talking about the idea of this workforce, presumably, as COO you do operations of these things, when you\u2019re in this ... really, it\u2019s an area I\u2019m gonna be talking a lot with Gavin Newsom about, a lot of governors are really interested in like what happens to this workforce and how do we define this workforce. ", "So you have a big one, Uber has a big one, Airbnb sort of has a big one, even though it\u2019s not quite the same because nobody is moving around, but there\u2019s temporary workers. There\u2019s gotta be a new way to designate them. Why don\u2019t you talk a little bit about this, because you were business ... you know, Ikea just bought TaskRabbit, same thing, which is ... we\u2019ll see what happens with that. ", "Talk a little bit about that, the concept of that, how you start to manage this new kind of workforce. Because you can say they\u2019re temporary, college students or whatever, but this is gonna be the reality, I think, for a lot of people. ", "Christopher Payne: ", "Well, I mean, if you talk to the average Dasher, they love the flexibility of being able to Dash on DoorDash. If you say, \u201cWhy do you do this?\u201d You\u2019ll get the answer of, \u201cI can make incremental money.\u201d The No. 1 reason sort of a Dasher leaves Door Dash is, \u201cI met my objective.\u201d ", "So a lot of times, you\u2019ll hear Dashers say, \u201cI was saving up to go on a vacation.\u201d I talked to one recently that said, \u201cI was saving up to take a class at a university and DoorDash enables me to do that. And then I come back to it.\u201d You\u2019ll have many people come back to it. To me, that\u2019s a service that we\u2019re bringing to the world at large, the U.S. and North America, and I think that\u2019s very, very powerful. I think a lot of the question about whether this is employee versus independent contractor misses a little bit of the point. This is like work for people and it gives them immense flexibility.", "Right, well that\u2019s your argument. ", "Christopher Payne: ", "It is, it is. ", "Some people make the argument they need health care, they need, you know, as more and more of the population becomes this way, we have to redesignate employees in new ways and new fresh ways to think about how they move with health care, how they move with all kinds of rights that they don\u2019t have in these environments. ", "Christopher Payne: ", "Yeah. I think what you\u2019ll see is that as the legislatures will opine on this ... But I mean, we very much believe these are independent contractor roles. I do believe ...", "Well, you have to, right?", "Christopher Payne: ", "I do believe that as time goes by, there will be more things offered for people to do more on the platform. That\u2019s definitely one of the things we try to do with people that do lots and lots of deliveries on the platform. But, you know, to me, the foundation here is one of bringing opportunity to, in our case, hundreds of thousands of Dashers. And I think that\u2019s very powerful. ", "To do that? But, Tony, do you see this designation changing, or figuring out a new way to look at workers?", "Tony Xu: ", "Well, I think the issue shouldn\u2019t be about classification. I mean, if you think about what is the root problem, the root problem is, how do we maximize all this flexibility, which Dashers love, and provide a security blanket for those who need it? ", "Right. ", "Tony Xu: ", "That\u2019s the root problem. ", "Right, 100 percent. ", "Tony Xu: ", "And what ends up happening though, Kara, is that there\u2019s lots talked about and reported on the classification, but it turns out, in these types of classification issues, lawyers make millions of dollars, Dashers get $50 in their pocket. That doesn\u2019t solve the root problem. ", "What has to happen is we have to work together as an industry ... but the way, also with other types of industries that have contractors \u2014 warehouse workers, truckers, doctors, and many others \u2014 and team up to figure out how to actually solve the collective benefits problem.", "And we collect benefits, that\u2019s the way you put it. Do you imagine that there has to be an industry solution to this? Because this is a really interesting issue as we move forward, because people aren\u2019t going to be employed, correct? Because how many Dashers do you employ right now?", "Tony Xu: ", "There are over ... well, we don\u2019t employ them. ", "Okay, I know. That you don\u2019t employ. ", "Tony Xu: ", "There are over 700,000 on the platform. ", "Right. And same thing with Uber, same thing as you iterate through the system. How is the competition for workers going then, or Dashers or TaskRabbits or whatever, what is the competition like? How do you look at it?", "Tony Xu: ", "Well, it\u2019s really different by geography. You know, while it\u2019s really, really competitive here in the Bay Area and competitive in places like Boston, where no one owns a car or only 11 percent of the population drives a car. In most of America, it\u2019s not. In most of America, people drive cars. In most of America, people would love these types of opportunities. And, again, I think it\u2019s, again, why. Why is because this is an augmentation to what they\u2019re already doing. If it were not, if it was a true substitute and replacement, I think that might be different.", "Right. So thinking about where it\u2019s going as a business, when you think about what else you\u2019re going to deliver, you obviously start with food. What do you look at? What do you think the most promising areas are for you guys?", "Tony Xu: ", "Well, we started with food just because it was the hardest problem. It\u2019s not just because it\u2019s high frequency, but because if you can figure out food ... if you can deliver something in 30 minutes, you can deliver something in an hour. The reverse is not true. ", "People don\u2019t care. ", "Tony Xu: ", "Exactly. And so we look at what people like to buy and we look at how often they buy it. And we also look at whether or not it gives the Dashers the opportunities in the right hours of the day. ", "So, for example, we mentioned that we deliver groceries from Walmart. We do this for 500 other stores. ", "Which was a big coup, by the way, for you to get this contract with Walmart, but go ahead. Working with them. ", "Tony Xu: ", "It\u2019s been a great partnership. And one of the big benefits of partnering with Walmart is that grocery deliveries actually happen at very different times than, say, when restaurant meals get bought. And so as a result of that, Dashers now have even more choice, there are more work opportunities in different hours of the day in which they can deliver different types of things. ", "And so you can work a couple hours in the morning delivering Walmart groceries, or you can choose to deliver longer and extend that into lunch.", "Is there anything you wouldn\u2019t deliver?", "Tony Xu: ", "Not that I can think of. ", "So where are you moving? Groceries, food, then what?", "Tony Xu: ", "Well, what else do you buy?", "Well, I\u2019ve had a lot of bad delivery experiences recently. ", "Tony Xu: ", "Oh, okay. Tell me about that. ", "Christopher Payne: ", "Washing machines. ", "Tony Xu: ", "Oh, yeah. ", "Everything. No, ", "it was dishwashers", ". ", "Christopher Payne: ", "Oh, it was dishwashers, sorry. ", "Tony Xu: ", "Dishwashers. ", "But then it was a shelf, then it was a bed, then it was a this. And Amazon did everything flawlessly. Flawlessly, and I hated them for it. I have to say, I really wanted them to screw up and they didn\u2019t. There was not one.", "Tony Xu: ", "Not one. ", "Not one, everything was right. They delivered the right thing, they delivered it at the right time, they gave me the right texts. It was really quite astonishing. ", "Tony Xu: ", "And imagine if you can do that from all the stores in your city. ", "Yes. ", "Tony Xu: ", "You can have even more choices of buying ...", "Well, Prime Now is from some stores. It seems like they\u2019re going to stores, right?", "Tony Xu: ", "It\u2019s from their own warehouse. ", "Christopher Payne: ", "It\u2019s their warehouse, I believe. ", "Yeah. But it seems like they\u2019re pulling from all over the place. I think at one point they were pulling from a store. I couldn\u2019t tell, it seemed like they were pulling from a store. Nonetheless, it was really flawless. And so it troubled me for local retailers to worry about how they were going to survive. ", "Tony Xu: ", "I mean, the way I think about this is there is no company out there today that is a business partner to the businesses locally. If you think about it, if we wanted to make t-shirts and we wanted to sell them online, we might sell through an Amazon or an eBay or we might buy ads from a Facebook or an Instagram or a Google. But if we wanted to open a t-shirt store on the street, on Market Street, and we wanted to get business, how do we do that? It\u2019s not obvious. There aren\u2019t obvious business partners that you would go to. ", "Right. ", "Tony Xu: ", "And so I think there\u2019s a massive opportunity to be that unique company. ", "All right. We\u2019re here with Tony Xu and Christopher Payne, the CEO and COO of DoorDash. Tony started the company in 2013. What prompted you to do this? Sorry, I\u2019ve heard your story, but I\u2019ve utterly forgotten it. You just decided this was ... \u2018cause of your family\u2019s business. ", "Tony Xu: ", "Well, it wasn\u2019t about delivery, it was about helping businesses. ", "Helping businesses do better. When you\u2019re thinking about doing this, when you\u2019re gonna do a startup, what was the impetus for doing that? You just thought this was a good idea? ", "Tony Xu: ", "We treated it like a project. ", "Like a project.", "Tony Xu: ", "Yeah. And it was to answer three basic questions, which was, is this something that people want or is this something that just Silicon Valley people want? ", "Well, yes. But you know my line, you know my famous line. ", "Tony Xu: ", "No, what\u2019s your famous line?", "San Francisco is assisted living for millennials. But go ahead, move along. Think about it. ", "Tony Xu: ", "But that\u2019s why actually our first market outside of Palo Alto ...", "Has to be San Francisco. ", "Tony Xu: ", "No! It was east San Jose. ", "Okay. ", "Tony Xu: ", "It was because we wanted to see if this could be a mainstream product, ", "not", " a Silicon Valley product. ", "Right. It\u2019s a bunch of young men. ", "Tony Xu: ", "And we\u2019re actually much bigger outside of the Valley than we are in the Bay Area. ", "What\u2019s the biggest area besides this?", "Tony Xu: ", "We\u2019re really big in the Midwest. I mean, think of it. So I grew up in the middle of the country, and in the middle of the country, it\u2019s hard to get convenience. If we lived in New York or San Francisco ...", "Well, New York has always been a delivery city. ", "Tony Xu: ", "Right. No, no, but if we lived in New York, we don\u2019t even have to get delivery, we can just walk down the stairs and we can throw a rock and hit a thousand stores. That\u2019s not true in most of America. ", "Right. ", "Tony Xu: ", "And so, no, we actually started out by figuring out, can this actually work in a less dense place? Because if you can make it work there, you ", "can", " make it work in a New York or a San Francisco. If you can make it at a price point work for middle America, you can make it work for the Bay Area. Not the other way around. ", "So, yeah. It started like a project. And it was, is this something that mainstream America wanted? Number two, is this something that restaurants wanted and pay us for? And number three, is this something that we could afford, in terms of partnering with the Dashers?", "So, what\u2019s it like being a startup right now, for both of you? I mean, you\u2019ve been in big companies, Chris, pretty much. What is the startup environment now? It\u2019s not quite as sunny as it was, it feels like. ", "Christopher Payne: ", "I love it. ", "All right, all right. Well, because you\u2019ve been at like big, giant, horrible companies. ", "Christopher Payne: ", "Exactly. I mean, I love the speed. The thing I like ... it\u2019s funny, with DoorDash, lunch happens every day, dinner happens every day, so we get a report card sort of twice a day. And the pace is such that we\u2019re launching, constantly, new products, new features, trying to listen to the customer. ", "You know, the launching to the 3,000 cities this year was a monumental undertaking. And it was awesome to be able to see us do that in 12 months. The thing that surprised me is that the markets we launched are actually doing better than the markets we launched four, five years ago. And I think it speaks to what Tony was saying, is that these cities did not have these capabilities. ", "So if you look at Cincinnati, Detroit, Indianapolis, Jacksonville. We just launched Burlington, Vermont, believe it or not, just to give you a flavor for where we are now. Bremerton, Washington. They\u2019re doing incredibly well because they\u2019ve never had this capability. So I love it, I thrive on building something that people love. I was a customer before I joined DoorDash. ", "But the startup environment, I think it has changed. You\u2019ve collected all this money for investment, and now, there hasn\u2019t been a big startup lately, there hasn\u2019t been a big startup environment right now. It feels like it, just think of the last big startup was Uber, Airbnb, yours. There was a class of them that hasn\u2019t happened since then. ", "Tony Xu: ", "I think there are a lot of startups. I think what\u2019s tough being a startup right now is you want to make concentrated bets, as a startup. You want to go all-in on a few things and bet well and bet correctly. And one of those things is getting great talent. But that talent, right now, is so dispersed in a lot of these mini projects. And I think that\u2019s one of the big reasons why you\u2019re not seeing maybe more bigger startups. Because I think while it\u2019s never been easier to start a company, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever been harder to scale a company. It\u2019s expensive. ", "Right.", "Tony Xu: ", "The capital ... We talked about this. It\u2019s hard scaling quality, not just of hiring but building the product, building decentralized teams. That\u2019s really hard right now.", "What about the image of Silicon Valley? Has that been affecting you all at all? Do you feel like it has or does it just bypass you because you\u2019re not really doing social media or the other things that are sort of in hot water? The image of tech has gotten beaten up, I think, recently.", "Tony Xu: ", "Yeah. I mean, I think we\u2019re very cognizant of that. I think the fact that we started the company with a mission to help merchants and because that\u2019s in the cultural DNA I don\u2019t think we ...", "Rather than destroy people. Right. Right. ", "Tony Xu: ", "Well...", "Well, no. A lot of startups say, \u201cWe\u2019re here to destroy\u201d or disrupt or break down.", "Tony Xu: ", "Yeah. No. I think because that\u2019s in the cultural DNA ... We never sought that kind of attention.", "Right.", "Tony Xu: ", "It\u2019s one of the reasons why we were fairly understated and under the radar in our five-year history.", "Mm-hmm. In terms of doing\u2026 ?", "Tony Xu: ", "Getting coverage or doing a lot of the social media. ", "What does it take now to be an entrepreneur? I think a lot of people sort of are interested in ... There\u2019s a lot of focus on the mistakes that entrepreneurs have made, but what are the important things to be an entrepreneur right now? When you have a company that you\u2019re trying ... You\u2019re at the point where you have got to reach escape velocity, presumably, right? That\u2019s the moment your company seems to be at. ", "Tony Xu: ", "Yes. ", "Where you go to the ...", "Tony Xu: ", "We\u2019re past that. We\u2019ve been very fortunate where the breakout product-market fit has happened.", "What do you think the key parts are to doing that for these companies that are sort of on the edge?", "Tony Xu: ", "Okay. Well, there\u2019s some things that are in your control and some things that are not. I would focus on the things that are ", "in", " your control. I would say, first, you have to have a big reason for why you want to do something. Inevitably, you\u2019re going to have tough times. We\u2019ve had ours.", "Well, talk about one of those.", "Tony Xu: ", "Yeah. I mean, yes, we talked about DoorDash raising almost a billion dollars but previous to 2018 DoorDash raised $180 million, which is a lot of money but relative to some of the peers in the space it\u2019s a tiny single-digit percentage of what the peers have raised.", "Right.", "Tony Xu: ", "The external world was very negative about our space. ", "Explain why. Because there was so much competition, because\u2026?", "Tony Xu: ", "Yeah. Well, a couple things happened. I know there\u2019s a lot of wonders right now about the macro environment but in 2016, let\u2019s be clear, there was actually a downturn in the first quarter.", "There was.", "Tony Xu: ", "LinkedIn lost half their value in a day. Salesforce did that in something like a week. That was also when DoorDash was raising its series C. Not the best timing.", "Right.", "Tony Xu: ", "That wasn\u2019t what we had planned for and so it was difficult. Through those two years, we really had to hunker down to make sure that the business model would work on the money that we had and then after that, stepped on the gas, raised the money that we did ... I mean, we raised 80 percent of our lifetime financing in one year. That was 2018. ", "Right. Right. ", "Tony Xu: ", "I think to be an entrepreneur today, you have to have a much bigger goal than just making money or building a product. I think the second thing that you have to do is you have to find great people who are in it with you for a long time. I think right now one of the toughest parts about being a startup is teasing that out when you\u2019re hiring and assembling a team. Are you here just because you\u2019re collecting a portfolio of great names that might go public one day? Are you here for the long haul when things are going to be negative and positive? ", "I think the third thing is you have to have a unique point of view. You have to have a point of view that\u2019s actually different. Ours was we wanted to help merchants. It wasn\u2019t a view that our peers shared, even though we\u2019re all in the same space. You have to execute upon that.", "Those are the things that I would focus on controlling. Then I think it takes a lot of luck. We, as entrepreneurs, don\u2019t get to control the timing of markets. We can influence the shape, the trajectory, but we talked about the Webvan story and had they had the demand I think maybe we\u2019d be talking about them in a different light today.", "No. It was the right idea.", "Tony Xu: ", "Yeah. Totally.", "I always say some things are directionally correct and then topically wrong. You know what I mean? ", "Tony Xu: ", "Yeah. Timing wrong. ", "Timing wrong. ", "Tony Xu: ", "Yeah. Temporally, [Webvan] was wrong.", "Right. Right.", "Tony Xu: ", "I think we had some lucky bounces along the way, too. ", "Right.

I could have found everything in there on Amazon. The way they put it together was delightful as an experience.", "The second one was heavy-duty customer service, which I think is critical. Such good customer ... It was a hardware store. You go in and there\u2019s someone right there and then when you say, \u201cI want this\u201d it\u2019s upstairs. You get upstairs and the person is like, \u201cI\u2019m here to show it to you.\u201d It was exceptional customer service, which was great, which was a pleasure to shop in.", "The other was just weird stuff like you can\u2019t get anywhere else.

That\u2019s my newest ... I shall. You shall be reading about it soon because it\u2019s a concept that I have. What happens to things? What happens to the way we shop? I do think delivery has moved into a quantum level of interest for especially young people in terms of, I watch my kids. Everything is delivered. Every single thing.", "Tony Xu: ", "Yeah. I think the other thing is we still need to collect a lot more information about the offline world. Not just to make deliveries better, not just how long is traffic or where is parking, that sort of thing. We do have to do that.", "Even just things like inventory systems.

Of course, they\u2019ve been one of our most important partners. But Spotify really started getting into podcasts I think around two years ago, and they\u2019ve had a really fast rise. So they went from roughly zero percent of market share two years ago to now approaching 20 percent of market share, and they\u2019re our second-biggest partner and our fastest-growing partner, and we believe they\u2019re the future. We\u2019ve done partnerships with them. We do a show called ", "Mogul", ", which is a documentary series about hip-hop history that we did in partnership with Spotify, and we\u2019ll be coming back for future seasons later this year. And so we knew them well, and we saw the growth on the platform.", "And so for us at this time, we looked at ... our basic idea, the thing that motivates us is that we\u2019re at the second golden age, at the dawn of the second golden age of audio. And there\u2019s just this explosion, this flourishing of new kinds of storytelling, new kinds of programming that\u2019s made possible by on-demand audio. And that\u2019s growing quite fast, just globally. And it\u2019s growing really fast on Spotify.", "But the actual size of the industry is still very small. Podcasts are probably a half-a-billion-dollar industry this year. And there\u2019s basically a disconnect between the number of people who are listening and the amount of shows they\u2019re listening to, and the amount of money coming into podcasting. And so one of the reasons this is the right time for us is we feel like for this golden age of audio to truly begin to flourish, there needs to be global scale, there needs to be better discovery, and there needs to be better monetization. And Spotify has all those things.", "All that makes sense, and I understand why Spotify would want to buy you guys and why you think that\u2019s a good home. On the other hand, you\u2019re VC-backed. One of the arguments the VCs and their founders always have is, should we sell or should we try to grow even bigger? Eventually, we\u2019ll have an even bigger exit. What were those discussions like? When did Spotify come to you and say, \u201cWe want to buy you\u201d? Did you go to them and say, \u201cWould you like to buy us\u201d? And what were your investors saying along this process?", "Matt Lieber: ", "We had those conversations. Spotify came to us early in December and said, \u201cHey, we have a great partnership going. Let\u2019s talk about bringing it to the next level.\u201d And we liked that idea, because for us when we ... we weren\u2019t trying to sell the company. We weren\u2019t running a process. We never hired a banker. The company was going really well. ", "But we began to think about, well, what ", "would", " be the things that we would need to see from an acquirer? And it was basically three things. One is, they\u2019d have to help us accelerate our mission to use this medium of audio to create more human connection in the world. Two, they would have to understand what\u2019s special about Gimlet, which is that we are really invested in high-quality, excellent content that strives for more. And three is, the value would have to be right. And all those things just were very clearly evident with Spotify pretty early on. And so we entered serious discussion.", "It\u2019s true, Gimlet Media is VC-backed. We\u2019d raised 27-some-odd million dollars over the last five years. There was a path where we would be an independent company where we would get large enough and profitable enough that we could navigate the stormy seas of media and maybe eventually go public or flow so much cash that we could pay out distributions to investors. But increasingly, as we looked at the landscape, that became less and less appealing and frankly, like, less and less realistic. ", "And so for us, we looked at the path of being independent \u2014 and like I said, things ", "were", " going well for us \u2014 but we also know that there\u2019s risks down that path. And then we looked at the path of joining a large platform with global distribution and, you know, multiple billion dollars of revenue and data and discovery and amazing technology platform that was invested in audio. And for us, that felt like a better path where we could realize our ambitions and our goals. And also, make money back for our investors and provide a healthy return.", "Alex Blumberg: ", "To me it\u2019s just sort of like, it\u2019s the basic thing. If you look at these two entities, the enormous entity of Spotify and then us, sort of like our independent, growing but still relatively small, certainly to Spotify, empire of Gimlet Media. And you imagine sort of like how those two things go separately. And then you imagine what they could be together and the joining of them makes them greater than the sum of their parts. And that\u2019s just how it felt. ", "It felt like, well, if you put these two things together with the distribution, with the data, with the expertise in storytelling, and you put all that stuff together, what we could make together far outweighs what we could make separately. That started to feel very compelling.", "So you guys started Gimlet Media with this podcast series ", "StartUp", ", where you, Alex, were talking about founding it, and it\u2019s astoundingly candid and interesting and compelling. So with that in mind, here\u2019s my question for you: How much did the fact that you guys who work really hard for four years were going to see personally a return, how much did that influence your decision in December to go, \u201cYeah, I think we\u2019re ready to sell the company and actually see profit for ourselves.\u201d", "Alex Blumberg: ", "I think ... obviously, I\u2019m not going to sit here and tell you that the money doesn\u2019t matter, because obviously the money matters.", "Thank you.", "Alex Blumberg: ", "I don\u2019t think you start a company and just be like, \u201cI don\u2019t care at all if I will eventually get rich from this company.\u201d But I can also honestly say that the money was far and away not the driving factor.

We want to open a restaurant that\u2019s a salad restaurant.", "\u201cWe wanna open a restaurant that it is farm-to-table fast food.\u201d That was the pitch. It was these two things that shouldn\u2019t go together, which is very high-quality food and a very quick, casual environment. And we had a tiny little space right across from our dorm. It was 500 square feet. On ... You remember The Little Tavern?", "Yeah. Oh yeah.", "So, we took over The Little Tavern.", "Oh that place. Yeah. On the corner. On that weird alley. Where they had burgers. Like ", "real", " greasy burgers.", "That was the one.", "Really good greasy\u2026 Yeah.", "So we took that tiny little space.", "Why was it open? Did they close?", "It closed. It became a Philly Cheesesteak. And then it was empty when we were there. And so we took that over.", "It\u2019s near Dixie Liquors.", "Exactly.", "So people would go get beer and then go get a greasy burger.", "And now they\u2019re getting organic food.", "Yeah, it is there. I just passed ... I was at CB2, which is right near it, next to where you ...", "Yeah. So the first ... raised $300,000 from family and friends. And then it was ... the next five years was us building a network and asking for money and getting advice or asking for advice and getting money. But it ... we raised about just over $10 million in the first five years.", "These are from professional investors?", "No. Some professional, some angels, some, you know, mentors of ours, whether it was Walter Robbs, you know, one of the CEOs of Whole Foods. Or Danny Meijer or people like that who were ...", "They saw what you were doing.", "They saw what we were doing and gave us angel investment checks. And so we did that for the first five years. Raised about $10 million. Got up to about 20, 25 restaurants, and had just started to expand outside of D.C. \u2014 we were in Philly, Boston and New York at this point \u2014 and then Steve and Ted came in.", "Right. So both of them. Wow. That\u2019s a big ... Don\u2019t you have a lot of patience. I know them very well.", "Yeah, they\u2019ve been great.", "So ... and how did they ... how did you attract them? This is Steve Case and Ted Leonsis, the early AOL executives. The CEO and the president.", "We\u2019ve attracted pretty much all of our investors as customers first. ", "So they had been using.", "They were using. They were just ... We now had 20 restaurants in D.C. Steve was eating it, and one of Steve\u2019s associates, or one of the partners at the firm, his name\u2019s Evan Morgan, was a ... became a good friend. And it was helping us with the business, helping us think about capital structure and things like that. And he then introduced it to Steve.", "To Revolution.", "Yeah. And Steve actually was a personal investor, to start.", "Moved it into Revolution.", "Moved in and then we did our first ...", "So how much did you raise and how much have you raised in total?", "Today we\u2019ve raised about $150 million.", "And that\u2019s beyond Steve. Who else has moved in?", "Henry Ellenbogen at T. Rowe Price is our other biggest.", "Oh. Henry. Wow. ", "Yeah.", "Wow. That\u2019s a good investor.", "We have very good ... he\u2019s the best.", "Yeah. He is. He\u2019s from Baltimore. So, you ... so what was the idea of using veggies, because restaurants don\u2019t do that. Like, the pressure ... restaurants are notoriously difficult. And you don\u2019t really have a restaurant, do you? It\u2019s sort of ... there\u2019s not that many places they sit in them. How do you look at them? There are seats in some of them.", "There are seats. You know, we see this as building the food platform. ", "Okay. I wanna hear this. Food platform.", "Yes. ", "Go ahead.", "So the way to think about it is. Restaurants are content creators. Think about it in the media world.", "All right. Okay. I shall.", "Whereas a restaurant creates content. So our salads are our hits. Our series. Most restaurants, you know, if you\u2019re just in ... if you just have your restaurant itself, you own your platform, you go direct to consumer. ", "The world is now shifting where there\u2019s some sort of digital disintermediation of the customer. In the media world, you had networks and distributors that took the content and distributed it. In our world, you now have these platforms. These Uber Eats of the world. ", "Our goal is to be a content creator ", "and", " a food platform. So a full vertically integrated food system, from supply chain, production, content creation and ordering. ", "Right.", "Which is the platform. And I think that\u2019s what\u2019s interesting in terms of how we\u2019re positioning the restaurant, is having that direct relationship with our customer so we can better understand them, better understand their taste profile, their nutrition profile, how they live their life, and then be able to create different kinds of food for them.", "Right.", "And also meet them wherever they are. So over time, we see us not as a restaurant company but really as a food ecosystem.", "All right.", "So restaurants of all different shapes and sizes. We have delivery on demand so we create an outpost, which is kind of like a batch delivery service. And then being able to order in many, many different ways, whether it\u2019s voice ordering, text ordering, Slack ordering. We wanna take these trends we\u2019ve seen in e-commerce and apply it to food, which is so huge. You know, food is one-and-a-half trillion dollars. And it\u2019s one percent digitally ...", "So applying all those digital platforms \u2014 we\u2019ll get to that in the next section \u2014 but restaurants are notoriously hard for margins, very tight margins. It\u2019s not a business that has attracted venture money because of that, because it\u2019s not something that\u2019s, I guess \u201cscalable\u201d would be the right word. But you think it is.", "It is scalable. Yes. It is scalable.", "Well, I guess McDonald\u2019s is ... Yeah, yeah, yes.", "The example we use is Starbucks as the best global iconic brand that\u2019s scaled food, or food and coffee. We\u2019d like to do that for real food.", "Right. For any kind of real food.", "And what they\u2019ve done, they\u2019ve done it in a different era, so their innovation\u2019s really on format, in terms of store format. Whether it\u2019s all different shapes of sizes of that Starbucks exist, whether it\u2019s in hospitals or airports or universities, in your office, etc. How do you ... You know, whether it\u2019s Via or the pods, how do we do that for real food? And take this promise, this trust, of our supply chain and the way we source, and our understanding of the customer, and then meet you in all of these different channels.", "So what do you compare ... who did you look to then for inspiration? Or wasn\u2019t there anybody doing this?", "No one really doing it. And I think at different stages of the business, we\u2019ve looked to different people.", "Mm-hmm. Starbucks being one of them.", "We\u2019ve looked to Starbucks. In the early days we definitely looked to Whole Foods in terms of the food ethos that they had. Looked at a brand like Patagonia and their commitment to sustainability. But also looked at companies, you know, this sounds clich\u00e9, but like Apple. And their ecosystem strategy of both products, experiences and services. And so our idea is just applying that to food.", "Finding that food. Now what\u2019s the challenge when it\u2019s food and not, say, a cup of coffee? Because that\u2019s a very easy delivery.", "A lot of ... just complexity. So there\u2019s definitely a lot of complexity in terms of the operation, and people matter, right? People and the service matters. The thing about, you know, I used the media example, right, where we create hits and then we have a platform where we distribute it. ", "\u201cHits\u201d being the salads.", "The salads and the bowls and the meals. But the difference is, you make \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d once, it\u2019s really, really, really hard to make. It costs a lot of money, but it scales really, really well. For us, you gotta come up with it, but then you gotta replicate it every single time.", "In each store.", "So what we\u2019ve spent a lot of time thinking about is how do we redesign the operating environment to also be scalable? So, how do we think about the processes within the kitchen. How we build technology that makes it easier for our store teams to execute real food from scratch. ", "One thing about Sweetgreen is, not only do we have a local supply chain, but we make all our food from scratch, in every location, every single day. So our dressings are made from scratch, everything\u2019s roasted from scratch. Like, on the hour, every hour.", "So it\u2019s not distributed like a McDonald\u2019s. ", "So it\u2019s not distributed.", "Where you pull ... I assume that\u2019s in a plastic package.", "But what\u2019s allowed us to do that is getting really ... just being intentional and thoughtful about the process. So we built something that we call Sweetgreen OS inside of the kitchen.", "OS?", "Yeah.", "Okay. All right.", "It\u2019s our operating system. Which, I\u2019ve used ...", "It\u2019s like the McDonald\u2019s movie, which is funny.", "Yes.", "When they were on the tennis court. ", "I thought that was brilliant.", "Love that scene.", "Isn\u2019t that a great scene?", "And we do that, both in terms of like the physical space and how do you design a physical space for something that can be executed in a consistent and scalable way. But also, what\u2019s the ... what I say, the Uber-turn-by-turn instructions, so when you\u2019re working in a kitchen, how do you make it easier to not mess things up so you can focus on the consumer experience and not, \u201cOkay, what needs to go in this bowl?\u201d \u201cHow much chicken do I need to make?\u201d \u201cHow much kale do I need to chop?\u201d \u201cWhat are my sales gonna be today?\u201d \u201cHow much food do I order?\u201d", "So you think about an OS that tells a head coach or a GM, you know, here\u2019s what your sales are gonna be for the day, based off of weather, events, recent trends, etc. Based off that, here\u2019s what it is spread out through the day by hour, and the product mix that\u2019s gonna be there by channel.", "Right. That you need to have it in there.", "For delivery versus in-store. And it tells you, you know, how much ... essentially we have an app for ovens and our cold prep that says, whoever\u2019s running that, here\u2019s exactly what you need to make, when, so it\u2019s ready ... you have just enough food ready to be then made for the consumer. ", "And then the cool thing about what we do, is because our food is made, it\u2019s essentially made like mise en place. So what that means is we make ... the food is prepped and then it\u2019s assembled in a customizable way.", "Prepped before.", "You\u2019re prepped just before and then so when an order comes in, it takes us just seconds to put it together. Today we have about 120 ingredients, which means we can make combinations two to the 120th combinations with those ingredients.", "Right.", "So it takes our experience and makes it very customizable, and our vision for it is to make a personalized food experience. So your menu should be different than someone else\u2019s menu based off of your tastes and your nutrition and what you like and what makes you feel good.", "And so, when you\u2019re putting these in place \u2026 there\u2019s been a bunch of restaurants that have tried to do this. Like Eatsa in San Francisco and there\u2019s been a bunch of others that haven\u2019t worked as well. ", "Yeah.", "Which is ... you know, the idea of putting process in place makes sense, because McDonald\u2019s did it. I mean, they just did.", "Yeah.", "It\u2019s how they ...", "My theory on this, and my philosophy is art and science. Where first we are a brand. At our core, we are a ...", "So everybody that goes in knows, this is what they are getting.", "We are a food company first. You can have the best tech, the best process, doesn\u2019t matter. If the food is not delicious, like, you say content is king. The user experience can be beautiful, if the food is not delicious, and food is emotional ...", "Right, right.", "If it\u2019s not ... if it doesn\u2019t ", "taste", " good and you don\u2019t have that trust, nothing matters. So our team is built around great chefs, great supply chain, a huge focus on the culinary credibility about what ... who we are and what that experience is. And then, you apply the tech.", "Right.", "So you can\u2019t have one without the other. And before ... you know, everyone before us, it\u2019s either you\u2019re a great restaurant that\u2019s not scalable, you\u2019re delicious food but no process. Or you had all the process but no culinary credibility.", "Delicious food. Yeah.", "So you need to merge the two. ", "All right. We\u2019re here talking with Jonathan Neman. He is the founder of Sweetgreen. It\u2019s a ... fast food casual, is that correct?", "Healthy fast food.", "Healthy fast food. It\u2019s ... how many stores do you have now?", "We have 90 restaurants.", "We\u2019re here with Jonathan Neman. He\u2019s the co-founder of Sweetgreen. You founded it with two friends, right?", "Yeah.", "From Georgetown.", "Yeah.", "Do ... when you were thinking of entrepreneurialism, when you were a younger person, most of the people who move to California, essentially. Most entrepreneurial efforts have gone on there. And there\u2019s ... your competitor, you have one competitor that\u2019s pretty big, is in salads ... it\u2019s one or two? You have a couple in the area. How do you differentiate between you and them, because you know, they pop up ... most things pop up first in San Francisco. I mean you see them come and go, like Eatsa. Various things. How do you think about yourself with competitors? Or don\u2019t you look at it that way?", "Well, for us, we have a lot of small regional competitors, and at the end of the day, anyone who sells food is in a way a competitor.", "Sure, sure. But, you know, \u201cI want a salad. Therefore I\u2019ll go to Sweetgreen.\u201d Or I want a taco or I want a ... There\u2019s all of a sudden a bunch of sushi places that are opening. Fast food sushi places.", "Yeah. So, for us it starts with our brand and the trust. So what we stand for. And a lot of that comes from the supply chain.", "Yeah. So talk about that. The supply chains. So you get everything locally in every restaurant area?", "Not everything locally. But we have supply chain set up in every city that we\u2019re in. So we think about our company almost market-by-market. We work with a combination of small, medium and large farmers. And a large portion of what we do is organic and then pretty much the rest of that is local. For us, it\u2019s less about these monikers of what that is, but it is about the soil. So unlike most restaurants, we don\u2019t buy food directly from a distributor. We go straight to our growers. We get to know the growers themselves.", "So no Sysco-ing.", "No Sysco. So we get to know the growers themselves-", "Even my kid knows about Sysco. He\u2019s like, \u201cOh my god, they delivered Sysco food.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d", "Yeah. And the thing is, you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re getting then. So for us we get to know the farmer and it really starts with the soil, because that\u2019s where the taste and the nutrition comes from. From there, we establish relationships with them and we actually build our menus based off of the supply.", "What you can get. Yeah.", "So it\u2019s how a high-end chef would build their menu. And that means our food will be different in different parts of the country, and different parts of the world eventually, and will be different at different times of the year.", "Right.", "We celebrate that. We celebrate the fact that food ...", "So, no more this, no more that?", "Yeah, that food should taste different at different places. We reject this homogenous food system that you created this burger and it should be the same everywhere, exactly.", "Well, there\u2019s so many people who like that. When you think about it, some people like knowing what a Starbucks is like. There\u2019s a certain comfort in Starbucks tasting the same.", "But we think that\u2019s ... That\u2019s actually something we are combating. That\u2019s a problem. That\u2019s not how the world creates food. Right? That\u2019s how humans want it to just be comfortable in this consistency, but if you go back in time before we created this food system that we now have here, which was created to solve hunger, which now has created all these other issues, we\u2019re trying to unwind that and remind people that you ", "should", " eat with the seasons and you ", "should", " eat what is available, because that is, one, more delicious, it\u2019s better for the environment, and it\u2019s better for you.", "For the local scene. So, in each thing, you get local things. What do you do nationally? Is there things that you distribute nationally?", "Yeah. So, there\u2019s definitely things we do nationally. So, we have a lot of ...", "Bowls.", "Yeah. So, bowls, olive oil, organic olive oil, organic wild rice. There\u2019s definitely things that come nationally, and for us it\u2019s all about transparency. It\u2019s about actually knowing ... Transparency and traceability, knowing where all our food comes from at any given moment, which is very unique. So, to know in this store, in this bowl, our lettuce came from here, and being able to share that with you is very unique. Most restaurants have about 20 percent traceability into where their food comes from. We\u2019re approaching 100 percent traceability into where all of our food comes from.", "And your customers are interested in this?", "I think it creates this level of trust, and so in all of our restaurants, we have a local list where you get to see exactly which farm or which grower it comes from, and it will say what\u2019s local and what\u2019s from ... You\u2019re in New York, it\u2019ll say what\u2019s from California, but it\u2019s that trust of saying we\u2019re proud of it, and we will show you under the hood of where everything comes from.", "So, you wouldn\u2019t ship some California tomatoes into New York when it\u2019s the middle of winter? You\u2019d have to, because everybody wants tomatoes all the time, right, for example?", "Yes. So, there\u2019s certain things that you do ship, that you do have year-long, but the idea is because the menu shifts five times a year, if shifts seasonally, a large portion of things are always available locally.", "Locally, okay. So, when you were doing this, how do you look at competition then, because again, there\u2019s been a bunch of salad startups that you see them, or whatever genre of people want to go into of this fast ... Is it fast casual? Is that the right term? Chipotle I think started it.", "Fast casual. I kind of call it fast food, actually.", "Right. How do you look at it?", "Fast food.", "It\u2019s fast food.", "Now, I\u2019d say Chipotle\u2019s a competitor. So is McDonald\u2019s, but over time we\u2019re trying to get more people to eat this way, and so the pie ", "has", " gotten bigger as more people have gotten in because we\u2019re educating the customers against this processed food system.", "But remember, McDonald\u2019s went into salad, and nobody wanted salad from McDonald\u2019s. I mean, they were like, \u201cWe\u2019re trying to be healthy.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cNobody wants healthy food from McDonald\u2019s.\u201d", "Well, there\u2019s no trust. I mean, you gotta ask ...", "Well, you can\u2019t even think about it.", "You go talk to generations, like a Gen-Z, and ask them about McDonald\u2019s, and they don\u2019t want to eat that. They\u2019re completely rejecting that.", "Right, right. You have to offer them something else. So, talk a little bit about putting processes in place, because I\u2019m very interested in the way restaurants are changing, because it\u2019s one of the areas that\u2019s been sort of immune to technology. It seems like it. It\u2019s done very ... I don\u2019t know. It just is not ... It seems immune to technology, even delivery, even the ability to get things, and there\u2019s been startup after startup I\u2019ve seen that\u2019s tried to get the food elsewhere, to move it around. Talk about how you think about the technology in the food preparation. What is growing? Is it the app, the on-demand delivery?", "Yeah. So, mobile\u2019s been a huge unlock. For us, that has been a huge unlock in the business. If you think about restaurants, you have a classic supply and demand issue, or at least a restaurant that has a lot of demand where you have a lot of demand in a very short period of time.", "Like a Shake Shack. The other night, I did that. I was near a Shake Shack, saw a million millennials in front of me. I ordered it online and I had it before almost all of them. It was fascinating for my kid.", "Right. So, if you think about Sweetgreen when we started 10 years ago, you have a line, just one line, where people come in, and you can serve X number of people, let\u2019s say 200 people an hour.", "Yeah, they move fast. Your lines are really long. It\u2019s fascinating.", "But at lunchtime, you may have demand for 20 times that, but ", "only", " for that one hour of lunch. But a restaurant, if you think about it as a utilization game, you\u2019re open for 12 hours and you\u2019re utilized for two.", "Right, mostly.", "Mostly. So, how do you leverage technology to capture more demand in that peak, and also spread it into the shoulders? So, for us, what our app did was allow us to capture 5X the demand in a very short period of time in terms of ... We, at that point, redesigned our stores to be mobile first, almost like responsive design, with second, third, fourth lines to facilitate the online orders.", "The delivery. Mm-hmm.", "Today, about 50 percent of our business is done through our app.", "Wow. That\u2019s a lot. So, the people order it on the app and then come in and just grab it from a bag? That\u2019s it.", "Exactly. That means ... We have over a million customers on our app, and it\u2019s growing rapidly because it creates this convenience for the customer. Their experience starts to get personalized over time, and it just becomes really sticky. For us, while we are a restaurant, the difference between us and most restaurants is, it\u2019s very habitual. Our app users come four times a month. That means they\u2019re treating it more like coffee than they are like a treat.", "Right.", "Right? It\u2019s fuel for them. It\u2019s a trusted place where they can just go to.", "Why don\u2019t you think restaurants do avail themselves to that? Getting back to McDonald\u2019s, I was in a McDonald\u2019s the other day. I don\u2019t know why. I think I had a french fry desire or something, and when I walked in, they tried to push me towards their screen that you order on, but the person who was doing it didn\u2019t know how to use the screen, and then it took 900 steps, and I could\u2019ve just walked up to the counter. It was a really interesting thing, and I was sitting there going, \u201cWhy are you deploying this technology in a place that\u2019s right next to a line that I can see is faster?\u201d", "It was just interesting, and I started to ask them, and I thought, \u201cOh, this is ridiculous. I can\u2019t,\u201d but I was fascinated by how many steps it took to order, and I thought, \u201cThis isn\u2019t the way.\u201d Putting a screen in a restaurant to do ordering ", "does", " make sense, because I was also at another place, I think it was in Europe, where you go to a table, and there\u2019s an iPad there, and you order. There\u2019s no people, only the people that would bring you stuff out, and you order it on there, and there\u2019s no waiters. There\u2019s no waiting and stuff like that, and it was really ... I\u2019m fascinated by how food delivery is changing. It is all around screens, how you order on screens and what you do.", "Well, screens today. Tomorrow, voice.", "Uh-huh. So, on an Amazon app or something like that?", "Yeah. Eventually, the screen is ... You feel it. It\u2019s slowly disappearing from our lives.", "Right, right. So, explain that to me. How do you ... Because I know these restaurants are slowly integrating this stuff in.", "Well, no one\u2019s really done it well yet. I think Domino\u2019s is probably the closest.", "As an app.", "Who has done it and have it integrated into these other services, but eventually you gotta be able to meet the customer where they are, if they want to use voice, if they want to be in person. ", "To your point, the in-store\u2019s not gonna go away. It\u2019s just gonna be supplemented by all of these other channels. So, to your question about technology, mobile\u2019s been a huge piece of this, and what that\u2019s done, payment and creating a mobile payment option order.", "Till it\u2019s ... Yeah, which is quick.", "Now it\u2019s delivery. So, delivery\u2019s about a $30 billion market today. Depending on what estimate you believe, it\u2019s gonna grow 10X in the next 10 years.", "All right. Talk about delivery. So, who do you use, Uber or Google or ...", "So, today we don\u2019t use it at all. We\u2019re preparing our own delivery launch.", "Oh, wow, your own?", "Yeah. So, we\u2019ll be partnering with a logistics service for the delivery, but the ordering itself, the platform will be Sweetgreen native.", "So, it won\u2019t be Uber Eats or whatever.", "No. So, you\u2019ll be ordering on Sweetgreen, and again, we want to own the customer in that way. We want to have the relationship with them. This is that media example where we do not want ... God bless all the platforms that are there to help certain companies, but for us, they take a huge cut, and then they take that customer ...", "Right, have that.", "... and they have the relationship with them, and we\u2019ve seen this story before. We\u2019ve seen it in travel. You\u2019ve seen it in media. You\u2019ve seen it in retail, and we have a strong brand that people love, and we can provide a better experience by having that direct relationship with the customer.", "So, everything they do goes up, and then you might utilize an Uber Eats or something like that?", "For the logistics.", "So, they wouldn\u2019t order on Uber Eats?", "Correct. They\u2019d be ordering ... You\u2019re ordering on Sweetgreen.", "How do they feel about that? Because their goal is to own customer. He says nothing. He just gave me an, \u201cMm-hmm, mm-hmm.\u201d But how do you convince them to do that?", "The power of our brand. I think there\u2019s always ... I can\u2019t say a lot about it because we\u2019re launching ...", "Because I think a lot of the other food services are sort of giving over their world to these things.", "Correct, and I think the power ...", "Generally, I would assume they\u2019d think about it as supplemental income rather than the income.", "Very short-sighted, and I can\u2019t say a lot about it. We\u2019re gonna launch our delivery in January on our platform, and then we\u2019ll be able to say a lot more about how we were able to do that.", "Yeah, yeah. How much do you imagine that\u2019s gonna be part of your service?", "I\u2019d say in the next year to two years, it\u2019s somewhere between 20 and 25, 20 to 30 percent channel.", "Half of your stuff is on the app, though, you\u2019re saying. Is that right?", "Half is on the app ...", "That\u2019s amazing.", "... but it\u2019s being picked up.", "Picked up, right. These deliveries go to offices or where?", "Offices, homes, anywhere.", "Wherever it is.", "So, I think delivery is an on-demand channel, so one-to-one. Customer delivery will be, let\u2019s say, 20, 25 percent channel in the short term. Over time as the physical infrastructure shifts, and the logistics infrastructure gets it so we can get deliveries under 15 minutes, that\u2019s a different world. If you look at China where you can now have food in under 15 minutes ...", "It\u2019s amazing. That\u2019s through ... Not Alibaba. It\u2019s Alibaba, yeah.", "Yeah, Alibaba.", "Yeah, through ... What\u2019s the store? It\u2019s ... I\u2019m blanking what it\u2019s called.", "Hema?", "Hema.", "Unbelievable.", "Unbelievable.", "Right? So, if you can do that and get your food in under 15 minutes and not have to pay for delivery or pay something very, very marginal, that changes. Why would I go outside? So, I think over time, if we think about five years, five or more years out, you could look at delivery being a 50-plus percent channel. Right?", "Absolutely. Absolutely. To me, it\u2019s super fascinating. I just got a second home in DC, and tried very hard to shop locally, very hard, but one, couldn\u2019t find the goods; two, surly people; three, me wandering around stores. The whole idea of wandering, hunt and gather, was insane, and I went to Amazon finally. It\u2019s mostly for the commodity stuff, not for the cool stuff, and so there were two stores I shopped at. One was called Home Away on 14th Street, and another one was called Logan Hardware. The reason I stopped at Logan Hardware ...", "Our headquarters used to be right on top of Logan Hardware.", "Oh, you\u2019re kidding.", "Yeah.", "Because it\u2019s a great store. You know why? They\u2019re just pleasant, friendly, wonderful people helping you. Now, they didn\u2019t have as much selection as I like, but they sort of did. They had enough, and the other, Home Away, they had unique products, which I didn\u2019t feel like searching for on Amazon, but everything else, it was really fascinating of who could provide me the delivery, the speed and the selection, and it was fascinating. I\u2019m gonna write about it.", "Yeah, and what\u2019s gonna shift is the infrastructure piece is also gonna shift. Where we produce food is going to change, and what the actual layouts of ... There will be restaurants that will have to be optimized for delivery, so the restaurant looks different. It has to act different. It has to be digitally enabled in a different way, and then there\u2019s going to be ghost and virtual kitchens. Right? So, your brand is very important, that trust and that demand ...", "Right, but they won\u2019t know.", "The demand generation is important, but the food can come from anywhere, and it may be easier ...", "Did you say ghost kitchen?", "Yeah, ghost or virtual kitchen, and what that means is your food can also be made ... It unlocks a lot of the constraints around what the food can be when you have kitchens that are not consumer-facing, and you can almost treat them like servers that you can turn on and turn off.", "Right.", "Right? You can light them up in different parts of the country in the world as you have demand, ", "and", " as you want to expand your menu, you can imagine how salad can now become more warm food can become breakfast, because you\u2019re popping up additional servers, and you have that digital connection to your customer, the menu changes on your app, and then it\u2019s delivered to you. So, things are gonna ... Like I said, one percent of food is ordered online today. It\u2019s gonna change. You look at where this was in e-commerce ...", "In regular commerce, yeah.", "In regular commerce, it\u2019s approaching 30 percent this year. Food\u2019s gonna move probably quicker than it did for commerce.", "Quicker, yeah. We\u2019re here with Jonathan Neman. He is the co-founder of Sweetgreen, which is a salad store, essentially. You get salads and lunches and things like that. I\u2019m curious why you picked salads to start with. Just because you thought that\u2019s what millennials like, or that\u2019s the food kind of thing? You didn\u2019t go with other kinds of food.", "Yeah. We started with it because it focused on the supply chain, and it was something that really highlighted the vegetable, and we think the vegetable\u2019s been uncelebrated. There\u2019s so much flavor and ...", "Yes. People don\u2019t like ... \u201cEat your vegetables,\u201d yeah.", "... nutrition in it, and we wanted to make vegetables sexy. We really wanted to make it fun and cool, and that\u2019s been part of our brand, is this cultural relevancy. The reason we ran a music festival for seven years, the reason we do these chef collaborations, whether they\u2019re with Dan Barber or Kendrick Lamar. These things all create this relevancy where vegetables have never been celebrated in that way.", "All right. So, you\u2019re not a restaurant. You\u2019re talking an experiential kind of thing.", "Yeah, absolutely. We look at companies like Nike, and the athlete is their superstar. For us it\u2019s the chef, and so how do we create that desire around healthy eating, the same ... What I tell my team all the time is Coca-Cola sells happiness.", "Yeah, yeah. They\u2019re the greatest brand in the world. They were. They have been.", "Right, and we\u2019re gonna tell people ...", "They\u2019re having trouble now, because it\u2019s sugar water.", "We\u2019re gonna tell people, \u201cEat your vegetables because it\u2019s good for you\u201d? Yes, it\u2019s good for you, but you have to compete on taste. You gotta compete on experience. You gotta compete on brand and that just desire for being a cool brand.", "So, doing that, what\u2019s the fear? Is it people think of you as a chain, right, because that\u2019s sort of the kiss of death among some people, that you\u2019re a chain and you\u2019re too much ... Think about what happened to Chipotle. They were very hot, and then they were not. Well, they had issues around safety of foods, which is something that ", "you", " all need to watch out for ...", "Absolutely.", "... given salad, but what is the dangers you\u2019re worried about in that when you think about that, because I would think becoming a chain, and oh, it\u2019s a chain restaurant, my kids don\u2019t like chain restaurants. It\u2019s really interesting.", "Yeah. It\u2019s something that we\u2019re very conscious of, and how do we design unique experiences wherever we go? How does it feel different, and how do we ... In different places and play to that local community, no matter where we go? ", "Our mission is to build healthier communities by connecting people to real food, and that shows up in different ways in different communities, and so we talk about this idea of the intimacy at scale. How do we design restaurants in an intimate way to that community?", "What does the next restaurant look like? It\u2019s one of the things that really shouldn\u2019t go because of digital, people like the experience of it, and restaurants should remain in ...", "Restaurants will remain.", "Right. They should, because people like to go out.", "Restaurants will remain, but they will have to find a place online as well. I think we\u2019ve seen ... In a way, we\u2019re very lucky in food that we\u2019ve gotten to see these industries before us be transformed, and have got to ... History repeats itself in a lot of ways.", "A company that I look at as a brand is Nike. Right? Niketown is an amazing experiential environment.", "Yeah, you want to go there.", "But they have the Nike Run Club and the community on the app, but they also have the physical, the actual Nike Run Club that meets up at the store. You gotta kind of have both of these. Apple is a similar way. Twenty percent of Apple\u2019s sales come from their stores, but over 90 percent of people ...", "Well, Ikea did it, too, didn\u2019t they?", "Ikea as well, but 90 percent of people have probably been to an Apple Store. It\u2019s an important part of that experience.", "Right, right. So, you want them to go. So, what happens in the stores? How do you look at, say, the purchase of Whole Foods by Amazon? Did that surprise you?", "I thought it was really smart for Amazon. Talking about this idea of how we\u2019ve had a lot of technology companies that didn\u2019t get food, and there\u2019s a culture to food that you have to get similar to the way that there\u2019s a culture to technology and building a technology company. Amazon could never crack food and the culture and the trust around food, and so Whole Foods has really helped them in doing so. They got a brand that had built over many decades, for them, a really good price.", "Why do you think Whole Foods sold, then? They were having financial ...", "They were having troubles.", "Yeah.", "They were having troubles. I think while they were so innovative for so many years, and I respect them a lot and their leadership a lot, they failed to innovate and embrace technology soon enough, and by the time they hit some bumps, it was too late. It was too hard to change and innovate fast enough to meet the consumer. You had Instacart stealing their customers. ", "You had Amazon coming in and offering a better experience, and so you have a brand, you have your core promise, but the consumer moves, and you have to move with the consumer, and that\u2019s what Whole Foods failed to do, and that\u2019s what technology is to us. It\u2019s just an enabler of meeting the customer where they are. It\u2019s not technology for technology\u2019s sake.", "Do you see other tech companies moving into food? They\u2019ve moved into entertainment, sure. They sure have and nobody expected them to. Now it\u2019s Amazon, Google, Apple, all in entertainment, which is adjacent to their businesses.", "Yeah. We haven\u2019t seen it yet. I mean, Amazon ...", "Amazon\u2019s the only one.", "... Amazon\u2019s the only one.", "And Alibaba.", "And Alibaba.", "And they\u2019re not really allowed in this country yet.", "Yeah, but it wouldn\u2019t surprise me. It will happen. Food is such a ...", "Alibaba getting in this country?", "... it\u2019s such a big ... No, not Alibaba, but just more tech ...", "Have you met the politicians in Washington?", "No, not Alibaba, but just technology companies coming after food.", "Yeah, that\u2019s what I mean.", "Because it\u2019s just such a big opportunity. ", "Who do you imagine, or would you think? I\u2019m thinking of who might buy you. Amazon\u2019s the only person I can think ... only company I can think of, not person. It is one person, really. ", "I don\u2019t know.", "Yeah, do you think about that?", "We really play our own game. We\u2019ve always ... It\u2019s been 11 years, and we have our own ... we find our lane, we follow the customer, we use our values.", "Where does it go for you then? You\u2019ve got venture money, which brings a whole nother level of pressure. ", "We\u2019d like to take what we do in eight communities and take it to the world.", "You mean, become a Starbucks? Become your own ...?", "Yes. Yeah, we\u2019d like to be the biggest food company in the world. We see us as the McDonald\u2019s of our generation, so this is just the first 10 years, 11 years I\u2019d say, is building the seeds, that brand, the foundation of what we are. ", "Act Two for us is how do we meet the customer on different channels beyond the restaurants, or whether it\u2019s delivery and all these other forms. How does the food expand? The categories go from salads to other places, and how do we go from eight cities to all over the world?", "Right, so eight right now?", "Mm-hmm.", "Are there any abroad? Do you have any?", "No.", "No? What\u2019s the challenges of doing that? Well, just the logistical challenges?", "Just operating challenges, but we actually ... because of the way our menus are constructed and the brand having such a local connection, I\u2019m actually really excited about ... Imagine what Sweetgreen would look like in Japan. That\u2019s a really exciting thing. Imagine what it would look like in different parts of the world.", "Would have to be very different, yeah.", "It would have to be very different, but our brand actually allows for that. I don\u2019t have to sit here and be like, \u201cOh, what does our food ... will they like this there?\u201d", "Yeah, Starbucks in Japan is very different than ...", "They had to really think about-", "They did.", "... how their food is different, but that went ", "against", " their brand, which was all about the same things for us. We do that anyways. We\u2019re going to Houston next year, and we go to Houston ...", "What does the people of Houston want?", "Yeah. Our Houston menu\u2019s going to be different than our menu here.", "How? ", "For us, it\u2019s going to be a little bit more hearty food. We\u2019re testing some warmer options and plates, things like that. We\u2019re actually testing wine and beer. And then the vibe is also different. People could drive and they want to sit, and there\u2019s more seating. So there\u2019s an example of how we build bigger restaurants with more seating.", "Right. Seating in these restaurants?", "Yeah.", "All right, so let\u2019s finish up talking about the challenges you face as three entrepreneurs who are very young. You invested an enormous amount of money. You\u2019ve got a lot of stories. What are some of the mistakes? You said you had Patty McCord, who I\u2019ve interviewed, was one of your advisers, she\u2019s from Netflix, in terms of people. I see right on your desk here you have Scott Belsky\u2019s book, \u201cThe Messy Middle.\u201d We\u2019re going to be talking to him.", "Yes, Scott is a good friend. He used to actually be on our board. ", "Yeah, so what are the challenges? Look at all your books. You have all your business help ... oh, John Doerr, that one.", "I love the John Doerr book. ", "Yeah, it\u2019s an interesting book. ", "Yeah. ", "Talk about what\u2019s been hard for you.", "Let\u2019s see. That\u2019s a good question. I think your job as an entrepreneur changes every year, and you have to be very conscious to switch gears. Very conscious of each stage of the business of, \u201cOkay, that was that stage. Now, how do I have to ... how do I lift and empower my team to do certain things that I was doing so I can lead the company forward?\u201d So, there\u2019s a constant change, and just embracing of change as you grow. ", "How many employees do you have now?", "We\u2019ve over 4,000 employees, but 200 in our headquarters. ", "And no franchises, right?", "No franchises. ", "And you don\u2019t even want to do that?", "No. ", "Because?", "Can\u2019t control the experience the way we want to, and quite honestly, the returns of the restaurants are great, and where we have the capital ...", "So why do it?", "So why do it?", "Right.", "Other things, it\u2019s always people. We\u2019re an execution business, and like any business, it\u2019s building a culture to attract that best, and for us it\u2019s you have like two businesses. You got the field teams and creating the best in-store experiences, and head coach is such an important role in our company. They are the ones that ...", "That\u2019s what they call them?", "That\u2019s what we call our GMs, the \u201chead coach.\u201d We give our head coach equity because they\u2019re such an important part of just creating that experience for our customers. How we treat our team members, and the way we pay them, the benefits we offer them, the development opportunities. There\u2019s a whole world in thinking about people in the field and in our restaurants, and there\u2019s a whole \u2018nother world of how we think about our team at the headquarters or in our regional offices. How do we attract, as a restaurant company, great tech talent? How do we ...", "What\u2019s your pitch to them?", "Well, \u201cWe\u2019re going to use technology to transform food and create the biggest food company in the world, and it\u2019s complex as hell. Do you want to solve challenging problems or do you want to create another social media app?\u201d ", "That\u2019s a good pitch. \u201cDo you want to ruin the world or do you want to feed it?\u201d", "\u201dDo you want to feed the world and make the world a better place?\u201d The pitch, which is true, is could you imagine ... imagine the world if Sweetgreen is the size of McDonald\u2019s. Imagine how the environment would be different. Imagine how the jobs of these people that are working and not making minimum wage. Imagine the health of the country because pretty much all of our problems start from food. Long term, we see food as healthcare. ", "Wow. ", "Yeah. ", "Okay. All right. ", "Long term, that\u2019s where the data and just understanding our consumer comes in, is we seem to understand how the food actually makes you feel and how that changes your life. And that\u2019s a better healthcare program than any insurance you can buy. ", "All right, so what are some of the challenges you face? What have you messed up? Entrepreneurs are listening, they want to know, and everything\u2019s not hunky-dory. ", "Not letting go of people sooner when you know ... there\u2019s times when you know that someone\u2019s not working, and out of fear, just all kinds of fear, fear of hurting their feelings, fear of not being able to do it without them. Especially as a young entrepreneur, you sometimes hold on to people way too long. It\u2019s just a very scary thing to do, to let people go, or bring in people to help them. Those are usually the biggest lessons from where I am, is it\u2019s all about team, right? It\u2019s all about finding the best people, creating a container for them to do the best work and empowering them to be great. ", "Where are you getting people from?", "We have people from ... I think one of the reasons for our success is a very diverse group of people, both in terms of people and experience and ages and backgrounds. You have people who\u2019ve joined us from tech, you have people who\u2019ve joined us from other iconic brands, places like Starbucks. You have people from Nike. You have people from Domino\u2019s. ", "Then you have a lot of people from completely outside of food, right? Most food companies are created from people from other food companies. For many years, we completely actually rejected that. We looked to reimagine the system, and so we didn\u2019t want people who were stuck to, \u201cThis is how you do things.\u201d It was, \u201cGet really smart people and have them hack the system.\u201d ", "Okay, one of the things that\u2019s really interesting is technology uses in the food collection, I guess you would call it. Now, you guys are doing some really interesting things around blockchain. Explain? The blockchain. ", "Yeah, so we started ... you know, you hear the word ...", "The application of blockchain. ", "The world of blockchain and how do we use it?", "Right.", "We actually have a very great use for it, and so what we do is we use blockchain to track and trace all of our ingredients ... or not all of our ingredients today, but some of our ingredients. ", "Because you worried about this idea, what happened to Chipotle where they had the bad salad because this is a ...", "It started from a food safety perspective.", "Right. Exactly. ", "When you saw the Chipotle thing, part of the issue was they didn\u2019t know where it came from. They could not pinpoint it at all. ", "Where the salad was, or what was it?", "Where that ingredient came from. ", "What was the ingredient? Whatever got people sick. ", "So, for us, it was, \u201cOkay, so how do you apply this for \u2014 it was a pretty simple technology of knowing where your food comes from?\u201d With that, we founded this company called Ripe.io.", "Ripe.io?", "Yeah. ", "Okay. ", "So, they\u2019re trying to create the blockchain of food. We\u2019ve partnered with them to be kind of like customer No. 1, and what we\u2019ve done is not only tag our ingredients, but also put sensors in the ground at the farms. So you have sensors that are tracking different variables in the soil as well as in the microclimate. ", "Then now on the blockchain, when we have it live on the public ledger, which it is today, you\u2019re able to see the ingredient \u2014 when it was picked, when it hit the store, the timestamps \u2014 but also what was the soil health? What were the conditions in the air? Then where we actually tracked some of the taste variables. So, what is like the sugar content, the salt content in like a tomato? They call it Ripe.io because they\u2019re trying to optimize ripeness. ", "So you get it at its most ripe point rather than having hard, non-ripe tomatoes in ...? ", "Yeah, exactly. So, how do we use this technology to, over time, figure out how to serve the tastiest food? ", "Right. Wow. ", "Not just subjectively tasty, but actually the brightest, most explode-in-your-mouth, tasty food. ", "Why are so many companies scared of using the blockchain like this, or are there more doing it? There are certainly none in food that I have talked to. ", "Well, you saw Walmart just did it with IBM. ", "Yes, they did. Yes. ", "And I think that\u2019s going ... with them doing it, it\u2019s going to set a standard. ", "That\u2019s right, Walmart.", "We were hoping to do it in our industry of ... the idea of traceability is, \u201cHey, we know where our food comes from, do you?\u201d", "Right. ", "What our goal ...", "So, it\u2019ll be sort of the \u2014 you have to have that. ", "Yeah, we\u2019re going to have it, and that will play up ... you talk about our mode, our competitive advantage, a lot of it is our supply chain. It\u2019s what makes our food taste so good, and the fact that we are proud of our suppliers and where our food comes from, and when you order food on your app, imagine you order delivery and you never see a restaurant, how do we create that trust with you? So, now it\u2019s on the app. You get to see that your food came from exactly this farm, and the fact that ...", "And was picked here then ...", "And the conditions were this. The fact that we know that, and then it creates a level of trust for you.", "And you think consumers care about that?", "I do, yeah. I think consumers really care where their food comes from. ", "Rather than just shovel whatever the hell in their mouth. ", "They care, especially if we can show you that where it comes matters for your health, for the taste and for the environment. ", "Right. Wow. All right, to finish up, I want to talk about what do you think food is going to look like in 10 years? The supermarkets, do they exist? You know, there\u2019s these cashier-less stuff, which I think is just a stunt, as far as I\u2019m concerned. Robotics deliverators or robotic hamburger flipper in San Francisco. How do you look at ...", "I see robotics as being something real in food. ", "Okay, explain. ", "With the wage pressure you have in food, what people are doing are passing that price right now onto consumers. There\u2019s going to be a point ...", "Where you can\u2019t. ", "... where you cannot pass that on to consumers. Imagine a world with $20 minimum wage, so how do you do that? Not all parts will be robotic, but there will be ...", "Such as?", "It will be kitchen assist. It will be a kitchen assistant. There will just be, you\u2019ll have to get more efficient. If you think about like your clothes that used to all be made by hand, and now you don\u2019t really think twice that a lot of them are assembled by machines. So, there\u2019s still things you can\u2019t do with food for a while in terms of like the art of it, of like the final composition, but there\u2019s parts of it that can be automated. ", "Such as?", "For us, assembly could probably be automated, right?", "Right. ", "Parts of it, and then you may need someone to finish it and make sure the avocado fans and the dressing comes on nicely. ", "The avocado fans. That\u2019s a key part. ", "There\u2019s things that ...", "Avocado fanning is an art form. ", "And then the service piece will not go away. Hospitality will not go away. But how do we create better jobs for our team members?", "Yeah, that\u2019s the thought. ", "... and allow them to do ...", "Without it being rote. ", "Exactly. ", "Yeah, I keep telling everyone, any rote job will not exist. ", "Working in a restaurant is really hard. It\u2019s really hard. I work in the restaurant at least five times a year with every menu change, and it\u2019s a very difficult job. How do we make it easier so they can kind of go up and work in a more creative and service-oriented place? ", "Other things around food, I do think food will become personalized. The fact that your media is becoming personalized, and you see now Netflix is going to now let you choose your own show based off the types of stuff you like to see, even within your show they\u2019re going to take you down. The fact that food is completely like you have three options, like the value meal one, two, three, or four. That makes no sense because, let\u2019s use kale as an example, every other ...", "Let\u2019s ", "always", " use kale as an example.", "All right. People think kale is good for you. ", "I love kale. ", "It\u2019s good for some people. ", "Oh, it is?", "You feel good. Some people, it makes them feel bloated and terrible.

", "It knows where you are and what you want. ", "It\u2019s terrifying. ", "How come your food is just like your ... there\u2019s this constant indecision of food.

The move raises a number of questions for Nextdoor, and it\u2019s possible that a new CEO will threaten the company\u2019s culture and momentum.", "The easiest way to think of Nextdoor is a Facebook for your neighborhood. The service, which was founded in 2010, uses people\u2019s addresses to verify where they live and lets them join community groups with their neighbors to talk about everything from local crime to garage sales. In many ways, it offers a more intimate experience than Facebook by connecting people to others who actually live in their community. ", "That intimacy has also led to some troubling uses of the service, though, specifically around ", "racial profiling", ".", "But that Facebook-like social networking element has made Nextdoor one of the tech industry\u2019s more promising companies, especially at a time when few consumer startups are gaining much traction. The company has raised almost $300 million and is now valued at more than $1 billion. It also recently started to make money, and just hired its first CFO, Tolia said. Nextdoor ", "started selling ads", " for the first time in early 2017, and has been pushing to expand its product internationally, a unique challenge given the local nature of the product.

He dismissed any idea that he was forced by the board to move into a new role.", "\u201cI\u2019m a co-founder of this company. I\u2019m the single largest individual shareholder,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one wants this company to be great more than me.\u201d", "Does this transition mean Nextdoor is thinking about an IPO? Not right now, Tolia said, but he added that the young business is growing. Nextdoor had it best quarter ever this spring, and has already generated more revenue in the first half of 2018 than it did in all of 2017, Tolia said. He declined to share specific revenue numbers.", "\u201cWe think the valuation today is very small relative to what the opportunity is,\u201d he added.

Tolia is known for ", "hosting exclusive dinner parties", " for entrepreneurs, many of whom have gone on to become some of the tech industry\u2019s most recognizable figures. The gatherings have included guests like former Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer, Apple\u2019s Jony Ive and Google\u2019s Larry Page. ", "LinkedIn co-founder and Greylock partner Reid Hoffman is another close friend of Tolia\u2019s. Hoffman says the two have been discussing Tolia\u2019s transition for months. That explains why Tolia specifically mentioned Hoffman\u2019s transition from LinkedIn CEO to LinkedIn chairman as an example of what he\u2019d ultimately like to do at Nextdoor.", "Tolia doesn\u2019t have a strict timeline for finding his replacement, but when he does, Hoffman knows what he should expect as part of the transiton.

The natural thing is everyone comes to you to say, \u2018Hey, can you solve this problem?\u2019\u201d That\u2019s the job of the new CEO, he added. ", "Tolia says the company plans to look for its next leader externally, and given the small size of Nextdoor\u2019s board, he thinks it\u2019ll be a group effort. The board includes a handful of marquee Silicon Valley investors, including Benchmark\u2019s Bill Gurley and Greylock\u2019s David Sze. ", "\u201cI think it\u2019s a highly desirable [job],\u201d said Hoffman. \u201cThere are relatively few massive-scale networks that really make a big difference in people\u2019s lives.

We\u2019re actually providing, as we\u2019ve said, all of those tools.

I\u2019m Kara Swisher, editor at large at Recode. You may know me as someone who has a lot of great design ideas for Apple\u2019s AirPods, but Jony Ive won\u2019t return my calls. But in my spare time I talk tech, and you\u2019re listening to Recode Decode from the Vox Media Podcast Network. ", "Today in the red chair is Patrick Llewellyn, the president and CEO of 99designs, who I met while I was in Australia recently. The company started almost 11 years ago, and he\u2019s been CEO since 2011. Before that, he was an associate director of the banking firm, Nextec Strategic Capital, in Sydney, Australia. Patrick, welcome to Recode Decode.", "Patrick Llewellyn:", " Thank you for having me.", "Thank you. What are you doing here in San Francisco?", "We\u2019ve got a big team in Oakland.", "I know you do. You do.", "Yeah. So, we\u2019ve got 50 people over there.", "So, explain ... I don\u2019t have nearly enough international CEOs on my program, I really don\u2019t. I have too many San Francisco CEOs and stuff like that. So, when I met you, we had such an interesting conversation about things and where things were going, I thought it\u2019d be great to have you on the show to talk a little bit about what you guys do at 99designs. What I\u2019d love to do is for you to sort of explain for everybody what 99designs is.", "We\u2019re a global creative platform that makes it easy for designers and clients to work together wherever they are in the world.", "Right.", "Over the last 11 years, we\u2019ve paid out $250 million to that community, helping over 500,000 clients get access to the design they need to make their work work.", "Right.", "For us, we evolved. I think our founding story\u2019s fun, the fact that it was a forum thread where designers were playing a game called Photoshop Tennis. They started using that interaction as a way of sourcing design from each other, and that turned into our first model, which was design crowdsourcing on a global scale.", "On whatever someone had.", "Exactly. So, we\u2019re helping you get logos designed, websites designed, book covers, illustrations, whatever it is.", "Right, right. So, you were trying to digitize the design process, essentially.", "Yeah. Essentially, what we were trying to do was take this organic behavior where designers were literally submitting to a forum, putting designs up, posting briefs, collaborating and using it as a way of sharing and learning, and then as a way of sourcing work from each other. There was no, \u201cCool. What are we doing here?\u201d We\u2019re like, \u201cThis looks really interesting, and a great way to source design. Let\u2019s see if we can turn that into a business opportunity,\u201d and that\u2019s really how we started. So, at first it was just like, how do we help champion creativity, facilitate this behavior that we\u2019re observing and turn it into something? And ultimately, we were successful with that.", "Right. So, talk about sort of the design process first. I mean, the way that design is done has sort of been very artisanal, in that you hire a designer and ...", "That\u2019s right.", "Talk through that, about what ...", "Yeah. So, we\u2019re breaking down those borders. Typically, if you think about the classic design process, it was like you knew a friend, or a friend knew a friend who connected you, or you worked in a workplace and there was someone in the corner who was the designer and you connected. At 99designs, what we did at first was a brief was posted. Designers would read that brief and think, \u201cDo I have an idea that I think is appropriate for that?\u201d Then they would engage by submitting their idea. You\u2019d get an opportunity to collaborate, commit, learn, understand each other, and then work together.", "Right, right.", "So, we really just broke down those borders. No longer did it matter where you lived, who you knew, what your background was. It was all about was your creative idea a match for what that person was looking for from their design brief? So, over time, we\u2019ve invested a lot in how do we get a brief off someone online, what\u2019s the sort of information that helps drive good design, how do people collaborate online?", "Let\u2019s talk about that. How do you do that in that digital format? Because there\u2019s a lot of great design ideas out there, but how are people shifting the way design is done? It\u2019s just like, because we don\u2019t think about design as much as we do the product itself. So, talk a little bit about where design is going.", "I mean, design is ever-evolving and touching more and more of our lives. I think we\u2019ve seen almost a design revolution. It\u2019s the Apple-ization of the world. Design\u2019s become important. So, no, there\u2019s no doubt, right here in this city, designers are revered, and I think we\u2019re seeing that sort of move down right across small businesses of all type. ", "Entrepreneurs, wherever they are in the world, are realizing that to stand out, differentiate their brand, to build trust, they need something. So, we\u2019ve kind of benefited from that movement, and then what we\u2019ve had to do is think about, \u201cAll right. Well, what are the things that are important? What are the important inputs? How do we get people that are perhaps new to design thinking about design?\u201d", "So, there\u2019s lots of ideation, lots of style, lots of questions around who are you targeting, who\u2019s your target audience, trying to get our community of entrepreneurs to think what is it they\u2019re looking to express, what is it that they want their business to stand for? Typically, if we think about branding or who is their book targeting, and then our designers interpret that, do a lot of rapid ideation classically, and then that helps them refine what they\u2019re looking for.", "Yeah. When you think about design, though, when you think about doing it, what you\u2019re doing ... These are a lot of people who are ... They\u2019re not entrepreneurs, precisely, but they\u2019re individual contractors, I guess, in terms of having to do their work, and then there are the big design firms that people hire, and stuff like that. The breaking down of this and making it ... democratizing of it ... You have to have a platform for doing that.", "That\u2019s right.", "Which is what 99designs is. So, explain your business.", "Okay. So, our business is exactly ... We are all about being a platform. It\u2019s all about how do we take all of these customers all over the world, we\u2019re in eight languages ...", "Who are looking for blank. Give me an example.", "Design. A logo for Recode.", "We just got one.", "A new book cover for your next book, illustrations. We were just talking before with Eric about new merch ideas. He wants pod merch. He\u2019s not getting a lot of love from the marketing team. He\u2019s like, \u201cAll right. We should be talking to 99designs,\u201d and that\u2019s exactly what would happen. He would actually rogue it, come to 99 and say, \u201cHey, I want to create a bunch of these illustrations or some t-shirt designs.\u201d He would submit his brief. Our designers would read his brief, and then they would start to submit their ideas.", "Right.", "So, our platform has evolved so that we can ... We kind of had to build a really big piece of software that essentially sits in the cloud that allows 10,000 designers who are online right now, engaging with over 10,000 clients, and doing that all in realtime. Right? So, they are interpreting briefs, they\u2019re submitting designs, they\u2019re collaborating, they\u2019re communicating, and then we\u2019re also handling payments. We\u2019ve paid designers in 192 countries.", "Right. So, explain the business model. You are between them.", "The business model is like ... That\u2019s right. So, we\u2019re like most platforms. We take a cut between what they pay and what the designer gets. Yeah.", "Mm-hmm, and to attract people to the platform, much like TaskRabbit, I guess, it\u2019s the idea that there\u2019s somebody to do something. You bring them to the platform because they can\u2019t do this one their own.", "Designers or customers?", "Yeah, both.", "Both, exactly.", "Yeah, yeah.", "We\u2019re solving a really hard problem. Being a freelance designer has traditionally been a really hard road. How did you break into it? In the early days, most of the people who served our coffee came from the creative arts. Right?", "Right.", "It was like you went into an agency and said, \u201cHey. I\u2019m looking for a job straight out of school,\u201d and they\u2019re like, \u201cGreat. Show me your portfolio.\u201d You\u2019d have some work you did at school. They\u2019d be like, \u201cWhere\u2019s your real experience?\u201d Well, we solve all of that. Right?", "Right.", "We\u2019ve aggregated all of this work that sits there that\u2019s ready for someone to do in our creative community, and then they are able to choose projects that stimulate them, explore design styles that stimulate them, and then practice their craft, build a portfolio, get real experience working with real-world clients, which a lot of the time they then turn into either a sustaining freelance career or an opportunity to go and take a full-time job somewhere else.", "At one of these places.", "Exactly.", "Right. So, you\u2019re trying to link those two together.", "Well, what we\u2019re trying to do is get people to work the way they want. For us, it\u2019s about creative choice. It\u2019s about giving people opportunity wherever they are and wherever they reside, no matter of who they are. I mean, one of the things that we\u2019re most proud of is the fact that most of the work on 99designs is based on the quality of the work, or someone\u2019s interpretation of your idea. It\u2019s not what school you went to, what postcode you live in, gender, whatever.", "Right. Well, talk about that because you operate in Australia, which is not here in Silicon Valley.", "That\u2019s right. Yeah. We operate ... We\u2019ve got offices in Berlin, Oakland ", "and", " Australia, but we started in Australia. But we started very ...", "I noticed that from your accent.", "Yeah. Sorry. Yeah, it\u2019s a bit obvious.", "Right.", "So, we started in Australia, but with a global viewpoint. We were a dot-com with ... We only took U.S. payment. Our forum was based out of a U.S. information site. So, we were very much started with a global viewpoint, and very quickly, our community represented that. Designers, from day one, were from all over the world. Customers from day one were from all over the world, and so we embraced that, and I think coming from Australia, you kind of have to. Right? You\u2019ve been there.", "Mm-hmm. It\u2019s far.", "It\u2019s a far place, but it\u2019s also amazingly international. Right?", "It is, absolutely.", "Twenty-eight percent of the population is a brand-new immigrant. Right?", "Right.", "Fifty percent, first generation. So, everyone\u2019s from somewhere else, and we also love to travel. You can\u2019t go anywhere in the world without meeting a bloody Aussie. Right?", "No, I know that. Yeah, that\u2019s true. They\u2019re everywhere.", "So, we\u2019re everywhere. So, we go ... I spent seven years living here. I came and opened our office. We\u2019ve grown that. We engage with all that Silicon Valley has to offer, and then I\u2019ve retreated home.", "How do you like the contrast between Silicon Valley and here, when you\u2019re creating a startup like this?", "I think we have to have very different mindsets. I mean, I think there\u2019s a level of confidence that comes from being a Silicon Valley entrepreneur that I don\u2019t know if Australians have. Right? I think we\u2019re getting better at embracing entrepreneurship. The reality of it, lots of Australian companies just like us don\u2019t have access to funding early on, so you have to bootstrap. You have to think about models, so making money\u2019s important. I know you\u2019ve spoken to Mike from Atlassian.", "Yes. There\u2019s about four companies that you all have.", "That\u2019s right.", "There\u2019s you. Who\u2019s the other one?", "I mean, we are very proud of Canva.", "Yeah, Canva.", "You\u2019ve spoken to Mel. You know I like it.", "Mel from Canva.", "That\u2019s right, but there\u2019s lots of companies coming out of Australia that I think are doing really interesting things, but generally, they do start, a lot of them, especially in the old days, started with this bootstrap mentality. ", "I think now \u2014 and you\u2019ve met a bunch of them \u2014 the VC community in Australia is evolving. There\u2019s a lot of quality there. There\u2019s firms like Blackbird Capital and Square Peg Ventures who are doing really good work with a fair bit of the capital, so I think no longer do Australian startups think, \u201cOh, I have to make money from day one.\u201d There\u2019s actually a path to raising capital, but Silicon Valley still is the beacon. Right? This is the biggest pot of money in the world, and so much of us end up ...", "But Silicon Valley hasn\u2019t done that many design startups at all.", "No.", "It hasn\u2019t, which I think is interesting, the idea of anything around the creative arts. They\u2019ve been elsewhere. Framebridge is in Washington. Anything that\u2019s creative seems to be somewhere else.", "Yeah, except for the biggest creative company in the world, which is Adobe.", "Well, Adobe. Right. Yeah, yeah.", "So, apart from that.", "Apart from that, yeah. Okay. All right.", "Yeah, that\u2019s right.", "That\u2019s a fair point.", "But yes, I think that\u2019s right. We\u2019ve seen design in Australia. We\u2019re over-indexing a little. Right? There\u2019s 99designs. There\u2019s Canva. There\u2019s a bunch of businesses thinking about creativity and how that can be applied on a global scale.", "We\u2019re here with Patrick Llewellyn, he\u2019s the CEO of 99designs. We\u2019re talking about ... It\u2019s an Australian company that specializes in putting together clients of design with designers themselves, which is a basic platform play. Right?", "Exactly.", "That\u2019s all it is.", "We think about it as a very sophisticated platform play because design is actually very nuanced.", "Well, explain the difference between ... It\u2019s not unlike Uber or anything else, like putting together drivers with riders.", "That\u2019s right, because all of the collaboration and work happens online, on our platform, across language, across time zones, and across this fairly eclectic medium, which is creativity. Right?", "Right.", "So, at the heart of what we do as humans, and we\u2019re trying to make that happen on a global scale. Now, yes, Uber is doing it, but it\u2019s localized. Right?", "Right.", "TaskRabbit does it, but it\u2019s localized. I\u2019m bringing people together, but typically the interaction is happening there. We\u2019re bringing people together and making that interaction happen online.", "Well, talk about how you do this, because creativity done online is harder.", "Yes, it is harder.", "Most of the successful companies are transactional companies.", "Yes.", "So, talk about getting creativity in a platform manner.", "Yeah. I think for us, we\u2019re very passionate about this notion of future of work. Right? If we can all get good at working online, that I actually think society\u2019s gonna be better placed. Right? Eighty percent of our designers live outside the major metro areas in which they reside, so we\u2019re already seeing that it can decongest cities, create opportunity wherever it can find itself. ", "So, you\u2019re saying talentism. Yeah.", "Yeah, exactly. Exactly. But there\u2019s no doubt that what we\u2019ve tackled is actually pretty hard. Right? We\u2019ve actually had to take a fair bit of time with doing it because it is nuanced, and there\u2019s lot of components. We\u2019ve had to become a payments company, a community company and a support company as well as online collaboration and e-commerce, right? ", "So you\u2019re right, there is many factors to what we\u2019ve had to build, but we are really excited about what we have done, and our evolution is really all about taking that now and really thinking about it holistically as a platform. I think if you\u2019d asked me four years ago, \u201cWhat is 99?\u201d I\u2019d say, \u201cWe\u2019re a marketplace.\u201d ", "Right.", "Today I\u2019m like, \u201cWe\u2019re a platform,\u201d and we\u2019re actually opening that platform.", "Well, explain the difference. What do you mean you are a marketplace? You are a marketplace.", "Well, we are a marketplace, but we think it\u2019s much more sophisticated than just bringing people together to transact. We\u2019re actually providing, as we\u2019ve said, all of those tools. We\u2019re also thinking about what\u2019s our place in the broader ecosystem. So starting to open up our platform for partners thinking about how can we API all of these components and give others access to this amazing, creative pool so that they can help them advance their tools.", "But how so? Explain that.", "Well, if you think about DIY design tools or website builders, creative communities like video or photography, having access to designers who could augment that work and turn it into something would be really valuable, right? And all of us can go to a DIY site, and hopefully, with time and effort, put it in, but a lot of us are time poor, and so that notion that if we could actually have the right creative at the right time ready to do work, then that can actually benefit the platform and benefit their customers and our designers.", "So when you\u2019re taking the thing between it, when you\u2019re trying to move an analog business into the digital space, especially around creativity, talk about some of the tools you use to do so. Because creativity is very different than, like I said, a transactional ... ordering a pizza, whatever you order from Amazon, or however you bring together different groups of people.", "Sure. So yeah, it\u2019s a lot about community development. It\u2019s a lot about finding the right audience. So we\u2019re building a lot of rich content to make sure that we reach a broad audience where they\u2019re thinking about that connection. So we\u2019re taking lots of data. We\u2019re using everything that we can see. ", "One of the beauties about being a platform is I know that Eric worked with Kara. Right? I know what designs he submitted, and I know what you thought about them, and if I see you work together, then I can say, \u201cWell, these are actually great signals that design is being done well between the two of you,\u201d and therefore, I can think of Eric as a quality creative. And so then I can start to better match Eric with future opportunities.", "And so for us, it is this sort of holistic view of all of the components. We\u2019re not in the business of building tools for people to create the design. We\u2019re in the business of trying to facilitate the most efficient ways of matching the right creators with the right ...", "Well, can you digitize creativity? Can you do that?", "I think we\u2019re seeing a lot of people attempt it. I think creativity is very much a human pursuit. I think we can support creativity through digitization. I think using data, using influences, taking all of the feedback loops and applying that. ", "But I actually still think that at its heart, humanity wants to connect with each other to pursue something creative. So I\u2019m a big believer that, in fact, it\u2019s probably the last bastion now that robots may take us all over at some point.", "Yeah. We\u2019re going to get to that.", "Right.", "But I want to get to that idea of digitizing creativity in terms of ... There are marketplaces where you just meet, which is what you are essentially are, really.", "That\u2019s right. Meeting online.", "Right. Meeting online. Talk about the tools you need to do that. What makes you different from a platform compared to any other marketplace?", "It\u2019s all of the components. It\u2019s making sure that we ...", "Because how are you different than Angie\u2019s List, or ...?", "Because we\u2019ve got tools that allow you to annotate a design and give feedback and poll your friends and get feedback from your friends and build specific tools for agencies so that they can show off their work, get NDAs, engage with their clients, get that feedback, pass that on. So basically, a lot of what we\u2019re thinking about is how do we connect the right people and then how do we facilitate the collaboration, right?", "So what is it that they need to collaborate? Do we need to make sure that they\u2019re utilizing Google Translate so if there is a language barrier, that would help them break that down. It\u2019s making sure that we understand who\u2019s good at what, and who\u2019s got the right expertise, and then trying to help usher those folks in front of the people looking for that talent.", "And what are some of the things that they\u2019re availing themselves of in terms of doing these things? What are the tools that are the most important when you\u2019re doing this?", "So for which side? The creative?", "For the creatives.", "Yeah. So for the creatives, what they need is access to the internet. They need access to software. We talked about Adobe, for example. So they\u2019re going to need access to the sorts of design software that allows them to build what it is that our clients are looking for.", "Right.", "So I think what we have seen and what makes this super exciting is the internet has become ubiquitous, and the cost of computing\u2019s come way down. Right? So that\u2019s what\u2019s really been a strong growth signal for us is the fact that more and more people have access to the software and the computing power they need to be able to create.", "To do this. ", "Yes. Exactly.", "Like what Autodesk is doing?", "Exactly. Exactly. And also they need to learn. Right? So there\u2019s now YouTube, Skillshare. There\u2019s all of these sites that share access to creative tutorials, and then we apply a place where if you\u2019re new, you can still get access to some clients and start to learn, and you can get feedback, and we have a very active forum. We have community engagement where well-known designers are coaching newbie designers. And we\u2019re providing a whole lot of information on best practice.", "Right. Now you guys have raised how much money? You talked about the Australian venture capital market. It\u2019s not that big, right?", "No, it\u2019s not. No, it\u2019s not. And we haven\u2019t raised from any Australian ...", "What\u2019s it like, Rupert Murdoch\u2019s cousin or something? That\u2019s it?", "No, it\u2019s the three degrees of Mike Cannon-Brookes. No, I mean I think Mike has done amazing work.", "This is Atlassian\u2019s CEO.", "Exactly, exactly. And Scott, right? The two of them are actually huge supporters of Australian tech and investing a lot of their money in tech, which I think is fantastic for the industry. But we\u2019re also seeing other first-generation tech entrepreneurs. The first VC I knew in Sydney was a guy called Roger Allen who made his money actually in IT services selling to Rupert Murdoch. Right? And so he did that in the \u201890s, and then took his small fortune and applied it to lots of different industries.", "Across Australia. ", "Exactly. Across Australia. And now, of course, plenty of U.S.-based VCs invest there. Accel is our major investor, and so they found us ...", "How much money have you invested?", "So we\u2019ve raised $45 million.", "That\u2019s a lot of money. ", "It is a lot of money. A lot of that was secondary.", "Right.", "So realistically, we\u2019ve haven\u2019t had a whole lot of contributed capital, so we\u2019ve had to be pretty lean.", "Meaning that you\u2019re profitable?", "Yes.", "In terms of doing these joinings, essentially. ", "That\u2019s right. That\u2019s right. And providing all of what we need to do to support that platform. We\u2019ll go to 120 people around the world, a lot of folks building the software, a lot of folks supporting the interactions, because services are tricky. So there\u2019s actually still a lot in supporting our design community and supporting those customer interactions in eight languages, and then attracting clients. So a lot of demand-side generation so that the designers get access to the work they\u2019re looking for.", "How do you get people comfortable using the design firms like this, this sort of off the cuff?", "Trust.", "Right.", "Word of mouth. Fifty percent of our clients come through our referrals, so it\u2019s kind of a bit like the old days. You used to refer a friend.", "Yeah.", "And now if you\u2019ve had a good experience with 99designs, you refer us. So we do benefit from that because I think design is a personal thing, and also, we\u2019ve done a lot of branding, and people like to talk about their brand. You\u2019ve been in the Valley a long time. I\u2019m sure plenty of people have talked to you about whatever it is on their t-shirt. ", "Which I\u2019m showing my brand right now.", "Exactly. That\u2019s right.", "Yeah.", "So I think that has been a very important catalyst for our growth.", "And your goal is to what? Where do you go? Where does 99designs go then?", "Well, we continue to evolve the platform. We talked about this notion of design contest.", "Design contest. Yeah.", "That\u2019s right. Now, 40 percent of our work is now through a direct connection between the designer and a client, so we got this thing called direct work. We see the evolution of both of those mechanics. So we\u2019re trying to figure out what\u2019s the best way to get a designer or creative in front of the right client.", "Right.", "If you need fast ideation, you need lots of variety, then this design contest is a great way to do that. If you need to do something complicated and intricate, then a direct match is a better way of doing that. If you need to do something fast, a direct match is a better way to do that.", "We see ourselves evolving. We see the opportunity to solve more problems for creatives. The reality of it is there\u2019s some adjacencies that we\u2019re super excited about it. So we look at animation, 3-D, VR, AR, video. These are all trends.", "Which have been tried. These kind of digital studios have been tried. There just haven\u2019t ...", "That\u2019s right. I think our time has come. I think the reality of it is to your point. People don\u2019t necessarily think first of working online to solve these problems. But luckily for us, there\u2019s been an explosion of apps over the last 10 years that people start to think about, \u201cOh, is there a Lyft\u201d \u2014 to be politically correct \u2014 \u201cin this town?\u201d \u201cIs there a Lyft for that?\u201d ", "You can say Uber, it\u2019s okay. ", "Yeah. ", "\u201dIs there an Uber for that?\u201d", "Yeah.", "We\u2019re here with Patrick Llewellyn, he\u2019s the CEO of 99designs. It\u2019s an Australian company. I met him when I was in Melbourne. Was I in Melbourne?", "You were in Melbourne.", "What was I doing?", "We were actually on a funny TV show together.", "Weird. That was weird.", "That was weird. We don\u2019t have any red buttons in front of us today.", "No, we\u2019re not going to do that. We\u2019re not silly people. But I do want to talk about moving creative jobs online. Because again, so much done is transactional or things ... Can you talk a little bit of where you see that going? Musicians have sort of have done that, obviously. Writers are obviously online. Artists are less so, marketplaces of artists. Where do you see it going with sort of the creative ... You were talking about doing animation, video, people obviously do YouTube and things like that.", "I think we\u2019ll see those platforms evolve and become a lot more sophisticated. I think we\u2019ll see virtual teams be created, virtual agencies be created. ", "Yeah. What happens to agencies? Why would we need them anymore? They haven\u2019t been disrupted quite yet, these agencies.", "No, they haven\u2019t yet, right, because ...", "Why do we have advertising agencies?", "I mean, there is something that they do that\u2019s powerful about engaging with the client directly and chaperoning through the creative process, right, so I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll ever displace them.", "Why not?", "Because I think people will still look for that trusted layer. We should empower them. I think agencies should be built on the top of 99designs. I think they could be a chance where you\u2019ll see more and more of the creative thought leadership happening from folks who play those roles on these online platforms. Right? ", "Virtual creative directors, art directors, teams of folks, because what do you need to bring creative together? Typically, it\u2019s a combination of a great writer and a creative director and a great designer. And so there\u2019s that collaboration piece that we haven\u2019t tackled yet, but I think that opportunity exists. And I think right now, what we\u2019ve been doing is we see agencies are one of our fastest-growing segments, so we\u2019re seeing ...", "Agencies coming onto your platform?", "Yes. That\u2019s right.", "Because yeah, agencies would be bypassed. You bypass agencies, right?", "Well, we could. But if agencies have built trust with a client, if a client feels that this agency is the best person, or maybe I\u2019m getting a bunch of stuff done by an agency, so they\u2019re helping me with my branding, my website and my ad spend, then that agency outsources the branding or the website design to someone like 99designs, the client\u2019s happy. Right?", "Right.", "Then they\u2019re getting the quality they need at the price point that they need. ", "Right. I see.", "So we\u2019re sort of a facilitation. And I think we\u2019ve seen agencies ... Traditionally, they\u2019ve been big employers of freelancers. One of the competitive advantages of the creative agency was which freelancers they knew and kept hidden from the competition. Now, we\u2019ve democratized that.", "Right. Right. That\u2019s right.", "So there\u2019s less of that. So what they need to get good at is utilizing the crowd. We\u2019ve got an agency based in Denmark, Cosmic People, doing amazing work. They were an agency of 100 ...", "Who you never heard of.", "No. ", "Only the Danes.", "Exactly. They\u2019re now 20, and they use us primarily for all of the design work for big brands. And they\u2019re pushing the boundaries of what we\u2019re capable of.", "Which they never would have been found by big clients.", "That\u2019s right. They\u2019re finding clients and they are utilizing us in ways that we could never imagine. We\u2019re seeing awesome animation. We\u2019re seeing huge billboards for huge brands that they are putting together as part of an integrated campaign. What they\u2019re focused on, this angle, what we\u2019re good at is actually pitching big ideas to big clients and engaging with them. And we don\u2019t need to necessarily have ... We actually think a competitive advantage is how good we are at using a global creative audience.", "Right. To do that. ", "Exactly. Exactly.", "To do that versus the other way of doing it.", "Well, the other way is, I am limited to the talent that resides in Denmark. Now, there\u2019s plenty of really talented Danes, but there\u2019s not a ton of them. Right?", "Right.", "If I can access all of the talent ...", "Limited talented Danes, but go ahead.", "No. I think we\u2019re saying they\u2019re super talented, but there\u2019s not a ton of them.", "Right.", "But if they can access talent in other geographies, then they can create amazing work.", "Is that what creative agents have to think of in the future is that talent is everywhere or is there ... Because it\u2019s been concentrated in New York, right? ", "Right.", "Maybe Los Angeles a little bit.", "That\u2019s right. There\u2019s other centers.", "London.", "London, yes. Berlin\u2019s always been a bit of a design set. There\u2019s the design set, the major cities have traditionally had strong design cores.", "Right.", "But then that dissipates when you get out. And I think we\u2019re seeing a demand for that all over, right?", "Mm-hmm.", "So if you\u2019re an agency based outside a major city, then attracting talent\u2019s always been tough.", "So you might as well ...", "Well, why not take advantage of the global workforce that\u2019s sitting for you?", "Right.", "I think all of us are thinking more broadly about where\u2019s the talent coming from. The fact that Silicon Valley now invests all over the world, I mean, I think I saw some stat that suggested that this year is the first time that there\u2019s been more investment outside the U.S. than in it.", "Right.", "Right? So we are seeing ...", "Well, there\u2019s not enough rat holes to shove the money down here so they\u2019re looking for international rat holes. But go ahead.", "Well, I think what they\u2019re realizing is that \u2014 and I think you have understood this for a long time because you actually get out and travel, right?", "I do. I get on planes.", "You get on planes, which is ...", "\u201dI take too many planes, I know too many names and I forget them.\u201d That\u2019s a line from Shawn Colvin.", "Right. But you realize that you go to these cities and you realize there\u2019s vibrancy and ...", "Absolutely.", "And there\u2019s people trying to do ...", "And they\u2019re isolated. And they\u2019re isolated. I\u2019m very interested in, I call it talentism, which is global. That there\u2019s someone in Syria, there\u2019s someone that is in beautiful ___, whatever they ...", "That\u2019s right.", "And they\u2019re unable to be accessed for the most part until now.", "Until now. And that\u2019s ...", "Right. And there\u2019s been attempts to do this in lots of ways. Coding. There\u2019s been a couple of these platforms for coding and stuff like that, but creativity is harder because that is something that is a very artisanal, in your face, let me meet the designer, that\u2019s how we sort of sold it.", "Well, that\u2019s how we\u2019ve generally sold it and I think it\u2019s subjective and there\u2019s a lot of communication. So doing that online has certainly been challenging. We haven\u2019t chosen the easiest of these topics, but it\u2019s one that we revel in. We\u2019ve always been about championing creativity and when you see the outcome of the right match happening and that right creative spark, it brings joy.", "It either gives people a lot of opportunity to meet new clients, for example, they wouldn\u2019t have had, or it gives a client a really good pool of testers. You get free design.", "You can. That\u2019s right. You don\u2019t get to keep it. It\u2019s not yours, right?", "Right.", "You only get to ... You have to pay to use it.", "That you buy, yeah.", "But what you do do is get ideation on steroids. You get to get stimulated from views from all over the world.", "Right. Do you ever imagine this becomes computer generated? I was going to get to that by the end to finish up to talk about this, do you imagine ... So here you are linking creatives with people who need creative stuff, as you might do anything else, which is great, which you find talent everywhere, as we said. But do you imagine this ever being completely digitized, where creativity is digitized?", "No.", "Why?", "Because I think humans need other humans to make them feel good about their creative choice. I think there\u2019s something magical that happens in that interpretation. I think it\u2019s actually very nuanced. Look, there\u2019ll be aspects of it that will be digitized. I think we\u2019ll actually use aspects of it to create better-informed briefs to make sure that there\u2019s better matches, to improve the skills. If I don\u2019t have to do retouching because a bot can do that, then great. Right?", "Right. Do retouching.", "But it\u2019s still, it\u2019s hard, right?", "Right.", "Creativity feels like something that is going to be the last bastion. They\u2019re going to have to be really smart and very nuanced. You talk a lot about this and I really love your podcast ...", "Thank you.", "... but this notion of humanities. And creativity\u2019s all about being human.", "Allegedly. I don\u2019t know. Some days, I think you can digitize it.", "Yeah, I think we\u2019ll digitize aspects of it. We\u2019re betting on humans.", "Yeah, I was talking about this thing to Peter Jackson earlier and he was talking about the colorization and stuff like that was done a lot by ...", "Yeah, It think we\u2019re going to see lots of aspects of it where the bots will get better, and they will do a great job of all of it. But who\u2019s going to come up with the story? Who\u2019s going to understand who it is that you\u2019re really trying to target and how to nuance that and deliver that in a way that helps you stand out? I think that nuance still feels pretty human to me.", "Yeah. For sure. For sure. What\u2019s the most interesting pairing you\u2019ve seen on your platform?", "That\u2019s a great question. I\u2019ve seen a lot. I think ... Yeah, it\u2019s enormous. I think the fact that ... One that comes to mind, we had an Italian designer who created a design for a rock star and ended up being in Rolling Stone magazine. That was pretty amazing. That designer ended up being on the front page.", "Of clothing. A piece of clothing?", "No, no. He created a tattoo for a rock star. We had no idea. An indy rock star who came onto our platform to source a special design for his arm, which he then got from an Italian designer and that was then put on his arm and that got picked up by the media. Then it was in the national press in Italy. It was in Rolling Stone magazine. That was a pretty unusual pairing. I probably put that in the unusual basket. ", "I think the relationships that we see are really interesting. There\u2019s an Australian designer who\u2019s based in Perth. ", "That\u2019s at the end, right?", "Yeah, it\u2019s on the other side. The most isolated capital city in the world. ", "Perth. ", "Perth.", "It\u2019s wayyy over there.", "Probably it\u2019d be hard for you to get to.", "I\u2019m not going to Perth. Sorry, Perthians.", "Yeah.", "Is it Perthians or Perthers?", "I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s in Western Australia.", "Those from Perth.", "We talk about the state, less about the city. Where it is. ", "Melbournians. I don\u2019t actually know what it is for Perthians.", "Is it Melbournians?", "It is Melbournians.", "What\u2019s Sydney?", "Sydneysiders.", "Oh, really?", "Yeah.", "Okay. All right.", "Yeah. We always ...", "I urge everyone to go to Australia, it\u2019s a wonderful, especially Melbourne, it\u2019s an astonishing city.", "Yeah, I\u2019m really proud of it. I love it. I think something special\u2019s happening there. I think there\u2019s something that happens in a society that\u2019s that open, as you\u2019ve seen it. There\u2019s a great social security net. I think, in general, society functions well.", "Is it different when you come here? When you come to the U.S. tech scene?", "Well, I think the U.S. tech scene is still at another level. I mean, this is still the epicenter of what\u2019s going on.", "Do you like it?", "I do. I sometimes find it overwhelming. You know, I think, to be fair ... I\u2019ve got family, I\u2019ve got other interests. You kind of have to be 100 percent here all the time. You know, it\u2019s sometimes nice to be in another city where the first question out of someone\u2019s mouth is not, \u201cWhat do you do?\u201d", "Right. Right.", "Right? There is a ...", "Welcome to America.", "Right. A little, right?", "Right.", "So I do, but at the same time I love being here. I come here regularly. It is one of the most stimulating places. I almost leave exhausted just because there\u2019s so much going on. You can tap into this rich vein. As a young Aussie entrepreneur, when I arrived here, if I can use the term entrepreneur as someone who\u2019d joined it ...", "Sure.", "... but when I arrived, we were a small team and I remember being staggered. The first job I was hiring for was a $15-an-hour customer support role. And the first thing that came out of the guy\u2019s mouth that I was interviewing was, \u201cWell, what\u2019s your equity plan? And who are your VCs?\u201d These are questions that we\u2019d never been asked in our history, right?", "Right. Right.", "So this place is on steroids.", "Do you think that other places can form a real entrepreneurial society or is it just Silicon Valley?", "We see entrepreneurial societies built everywhere, I think, but that would just be different. I don\u2019t think anyone will do it at the scale it happens here. I think it\u2019s hard to replicate. There is something magic about the combination of the quadrant of education institutions, the massive amounts of capital. And then there\u2019s something, the self-belief is what we talked about.", "Arrogance is what I call it, but go ahead.", "Yeah. I think it\u2019s ... Sometimes I think it\u2019s fantastic to see that self-belief and then sometimes I think we see the downside of it. And you talk a lot about that.", "Where does 99designs go? Where do you imagine taking it?", "Well, I think right now we focus on ...", "There isn\u2019t one like 99designs in Silicon Valley.", "I mean, there\u2019s people who do it. There\u2019s broader platforms that do a bit of everything. Recently we saw Upwork list on Nasdaq.", "Yes, that\u2019s right. Upwork. Yeah.", "And so I think they are ... I think, ultimately, we want to stay a strong, independent company. We want to focus on building great product. We want to keep servicing clients. Now, we are open for partnership, right?", "Right.", "We\u2019re looking for folks who think that they can utilize our creative community to help solve their problems, help improve the experience for their customers. Right now our focus is all about how do we advance our platform? How do we improve our service? How do we make these matches better? And how do we do a better job of what we\u2019re doing? I think long term, being in Australia ...", "Can you ever imagine replacing agencies?", "I don\u2019t know. I think we will be partners to agencies before we replace them. We do have big corporate clients who come to us directly, so we do see ... Univision uses us. We\u2019ve seen big banks use us. Big German companies of all descriptions use us for a wide variety of design needs. I think there\u2019ll be a place for everyone. I actually think we see a lot of coincidence ...", "That\u2019s a very Australian thing to say. If you were a Silicon Valley person, you\u2019d be like ...", "You\u2019re like, \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll destroy them.\u201d", "\u201dYes, we\u2019re going to kill them. We\u2019re going to kill them because they\u2019re old and they deserve to be dead.\u201d I\u2019ve got to help you practice, you\u2019re just too nice.", "Sorry. I know. But I actually just think there\u2019s going to be room for everyone.", "Say, \u201cI\u2019m going to disrupt them.\u201d Say that.", "Yeah, well ...", "Let me hear it from you. You can\u2019t even do it. You can\u2019t even do it.", "Well, I am ...", "Pretend you\u2019re Russell Crowe in \u201cGladiator\u201d and do that kind of thing or something.

What we like to say is the happy Americans are Canadian.", "Oh, right. Yeah.", "And then the talented New Zealanders are Australian.", "Oh, that\u2019s a little bit of ... Yeah, you did birth Rupert Murdoch.", "I know.", "So we never turn our backs on Australians. That\u2019s how we feel about it.", "That\u2019s right.

So I first came to the tech industry in 1982. I grew up in Albany, New York. I had to drop out of college for a while. My father died. I had to earn some money coming back.

But the key thing is I took all these engineering courses, but I just couldn\u2019t figure out how to make even a really large thing to collect all your data. So I decided I need to find a job where I can be around it. And when I went to grad school, I figured out, oh my God, they\u2019ll pay me to be a research analyst. I got to go do that.", "And in those days, that was like an academic job. It didn\u2019t pay well, there was no chance of becoming wealthy. But I go to T. Rowe Price, I get there the first day of the bull market in 1982, and they assign me to tech. And you sit there and realize, wow, for the next 34 years I had this galeforce tailwind. You can explain every good thing that ever happened to me based on that starting condition of that day in that coverage group.", "What was the company you were covering?", "At the beginning, the very first ones because it was \u201982, I covered defense electronics and software.

Not Apple?", "No. Apple was, there was somebody who covered hardware. Hardware was its own category. T. Rowe Price had a big tech group, and so I had software and the defense electronics and the space program. I was so badly prepared for that job.

So if you ever were cautious, that was a mistake. And the key inflection point occurred in, I believe it was \u201987. I went to a conference and I was trying to figure out how to do this PC thing. And these guys were unloading amplifiers and guitars from the back of a car and it turned out they were having a jam session. ", "They invited me to go along \u2014 I had been playing at happy hours forever. I knew hundreds of songs and everybody else knew one verse or one chorus, but nobody knew a whole song.

They had jam sessions and that was something I knew how to do. One thing led to another and I evolved this notion where I just followed the industry around, which in those days, anyone else sat in an office with a computer and a spreadsheet and read faxes.

Rowe Price. How did you move to investment?", "So what happened is the natural progression, you\u2019re an analyst and then if they think you\u2019ve got potential, they let you run some money.

I decided I wasn\u2019t going to own anything that had been founded before Apple. Nothing before Apple. I was only going to own the microprocessor generation company.", "I see. You wanted all the fresh, young ...", "I wanted fresh. So it meant I basically sold all the old guard guys. Well, if you pick only one decision in the \u201980s, being negative on mainframes and minicomputers basically gave you huge relative advantage in an industry where relative advantage was the only thing you cared about. And so I got really, really lucky. I probably made three great decisions at T. Rowe Price and the net result was I finished the \u201980s. ", "They created a science and technology fund in \u201987. It starts the first of October of 1987. The crash happens 19 days later. I\u2019m not managing the fund, but it\u2019s down 31 percent after one month and it\u2019s like the firm\u2019s going, \u201cOh my God, we just put our two best guys in this thing. We\u2019ve doomed them.\u201d Six months later they moved them out and they said, \u201cRoger, you\u2019re going to run it.\u201d And I said, \u201cOnly if I get to run it my way.\u201d And they said, \u201cWhat\u2019s your way?\u201d And I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know, but it won\u2019t be your way.\u201d", "Right, okay.", "And so the fund was this tiny little thing.

In the summer of \u201990, it finally failed. I had 12 percent of the fund in Oracle. The stock was down 30 some-odd percent on one day. Chips and technologies got blown up with the ... I had three positions that were each 10 percent or more...", "What did you do?", "Well, the fund was down I want to say 35 or 40 percent in a month. And it was like I had my own personal crash. And what was amazing, though, was that I realized that the Kuwait thing didn\u2019t matter because Windows had come out in May and that Windows was going to be the first time tech had a bull market. It went through the \u201980s lagging terribly because the big guys were all getting killed. But I said, \u201cMicrosoft is changing everything. I\u2019m gonna load up.\u201d", "I\u2019m going to just get rid of the things that had killed me and pile into Microsoft and things like that.

I was betting on everybody but Microsoft for a weird reason. But anyway, long story short, in parallel, I\u2019d been doing venture investors. T.

And I got to know John Doerr in the fall of 1990 right at the bottom of that.", "Because most of the funding of tech had come from venture capital, most of the big funding, besides the IPOs.", "And there weren\u2019t that many companies, as you remember. There\u2019d be maybe 10. ", "I remember when I showed up \u2014 yeah.", "There\u2019d be like 10 IPOs a year, one of which would become a monster company.", "Right. It was \u201994 right?", "But John was the hot young guy. He\u2019d done Compaq, he\u2019d done Lotus, he\u2019d done Sun Microsystems. And we hit it off. Anyway, long story short, in fall of 1990, one of their partners, one of their investors said, \u201cYou guys ought to start a crossover fund. You ought to get that guy McNamee to run it.\u201d So he comes up to me at Comdex, which is the big trade show.", "Which was the big trade show.", "And Sheldon Adelson, the casino magnate, owned it.", "Yes, that\u2019s how he made his evil ...", "It\u2019s how he made his first money. John comes up to me, he says, \u201cOne of our investors wants us to do this. What do you think?\u201d And I said, \u201cWhen do we start?\u201d I actually was working on a business plan to do exactly that with him.

Meanwhile, that night I stay up all night long finishing the plan, which I send him the next day. Nothing happens. ", "But anyway, a series of miracles occurs and I wind up persuading Kleiner Perkins that I have this idea. And they run it through a wringer because we\u2019re going to create a fund inside Kleiner Perkins, the first time they\u2019ve ever had a subsidiary. And we called it Integral Capital Partners. And I brought a guy who was my partner at T. Rowe, John Powell.", "I remember him.", "We decided to raise the money from the only people in America who thought tech was a good place to invest, which are basically the CEOs of the tech industry. And so we had this little vertically integrated thing, but it created this real weirdness because you basically couldn\u2019t own any of the portfolio stocks of those people. So a ton of money from Microsoft and Intel and all these other things. And you\u2019re trying to invest in a tech fund without owning those stocks. But it worked out incredibly well. The timing ...", "So you were at Kleiner.", "Yeah, but imagine getting to Kleiner in 1990. You\u2019re there for the entire \u201990s, which means ...", "Netscape, Amazon.", "I was there when Marc came in. I actually got to be in the meeting when Andreessen brought in Netscape. I was there when Jeff Bezos brought in and got to sit in on the first Amazon meeting.", "What did you think?", "So with Netscape, Bill Joy had been talking up that whole thing. And so we all were true believers. Nobody knew what that meant, but Bill had convinced us this was the next big thing. And so that part we were onto. Bezos, he himself was the story. You look at books and people had been trying similar things using Ingram as a buffer.", "Ingram? Oh god, the distributor. Yeah.", "And it hadn\u2019t really worked, but Jeff Bezos was arguably the most compelling entrepreneur I have ever seen.", "He is and remains.", "And he\u2019s really unlike ... There are a lot of great entrepreneurs and there are a lot of brilliant people.", "He was exhausting. I don\u2019t know how else to put it. He would exhaust me when I visited Seattle.", "But he was also funny, okay?", "Goofy.", "Yeah, in a way that the other guys just plain weren\u2019t.", "No, they weren\u2019t.", "He was very different character.", "So he had a lot of enthusiasm in a way that ...", "Yeah, he was just one of a kind, right?", "Yeah.", "So going through all that period, being inside Kleiner, we get to \u201997 and Martha Stewart brings Martha Stewart Living into the company.", "Right, Omnimedia.", "Well, it wasn\u2019t yet Omnimedia. That they stuck on the end. It was basically a home decorating company. Martha comes in and she\u2019s a total tour de force. John says, \u201cWe\u2019re going to slap the Kleiner name, we\u2019re going to call it Omnimedia, and we\u2019re going to take it public in a couple months,\u201d and they got a multibillion-dollar valuation for a home decorating company. I\u2019m going, \u201cOh my God.\u201d", "But it was Omnimedia, Roger.", "Yes. It\u2019s the end of \u201997 and I\u2019m going, \u201cOh my God, we\u2019re in a bubble. When this ends, Integral is toast.\u201d So I go to Kleiner and go, \u201cWhen this ends, Integral\u2019s toast,\u201d and they look at me and go, \u201cWhat do you mean end? This is never going to end. This is the beginning of everything.\u201d So I go to our other partner, which was Morgan Stanley, which owned a small piece of Integral and go, \u201cGuys, this is the end.\u201d And they looked at me and went, \u201cReally?\u201d And I go, \u201cYeah.\u201d", "And they said, \u201cOkay, here\u2019s some money. Go figure out what the next big thing is.\u201d So I went out and we spent two years and came up with this thing called Silver Lake. And the idea was to go into older tech companies and give them all the benefits of a startup. The problem with the old guys is they stopped growing, then the stock stops going up.", "So you\u2019re trying to give them insights, yeah.", "And all the people leave and then you go into this progressive cycle of decline. And I wanted to do it with Seagate because the disk drive industry had been going through this hot and cold cycle up and down. ", "Oh that\u2019s right, you were in Seagate.", "And so we wanted to do Seagate and we wanted to do the motherboard business of Intel. Those were the two examples we gave investors.", "So you\u2019re going to go in and save, invest, cut costs.", "No, the opposite of cutting costs. ", "Right, put money in.", "We were the opposite of a traditional LBO fund. We were actually going to increase R&D dramatically and try to change the slope of the long-term cycle. Well, Steve Luczo, who at that time was the president of Seagate, was completely into this idea. And he\u2019d worked in investment banking and he and I had known each other before we went into disk drives.", "So I would go to the Integral investors in the fall of 1998. And I go, \u201cWe think the cycle\u2019s coming to an end. We think you ought to do this.\u201d And they sign up for a billion dollars of this new fund sight unseen. And I got to go out and find other people to work with. I have one guy and we\u2019d go and get two more and wind up raising, I don\u2019t know, two-and-a-half billion dollars, which at the time was ludicrous.", "It was a lot, I remember.", "It was so far the biggest fund ever.", "Was this Elevation?", "This was called Silver Lake.", "That\u2019s right, which is huge now.", "We basically take in the money and I cash out the rest of the Integral fund in March of 2000, which turned out coincidentally to be the end of the cycle.", "Perfect timing.", "Again, just dumb luck. And we put the money in Seagate and this company called Daytech which was an online trading business, now known as Ameritrade or TD Ameritrade, and Gartner Group. And we do them all in 2000 right as the market is in free fall. And of course all three of them were magnificently successful. Seagate totally changed the disk drive business and our investors, as a consequence, wind up going up while the market was collapsing. And that made people very popular. But then I had a health crisis and I missed ...", "You and I had the same health crisis, right?", "Well, mine was a little bit more severe than yours because I had two scarring strokes and a TIA in my brain stem. Then I had to have open-heart surgery in order to keep from having more strokes. ", "So the problem with all of that was that I missed more than six months. While I was gone, my partners realized, \u201cHey, wait a minute, we\u2019ve got these three amazing investments. We\u2019ve already got all the money. We don\u2019t need this guy anymore.\u201d I was really different. I got to be honest with you, I don\u2019t play office politics well.", "No, you don\u2019t.", "And I wasn\u2019t, well ... Let\u2019s face it, I\u2019m not a deal guy. I\u2019m really idealistic and I\u2019m not motivated by money. Anyway, I come back and I talked to Steve Jobs and go, \u201cSteve, you\u2019ve just introduced this great new thing called the iPod.\u201d And he goes, \u201cYeah?\u201d I go, \u201cBut your stock is at $12. You\u2019ve got $12 in cash and your options are at 40. That\u2019s not going to work.\u201d Steve goes, \u201cYeah, but I don\u2019t want to do an LBO. Plus, I don\u2019t like your partners.\u201d", "I go, \u201cSteve, come on. We\u2019ve gotta find a way to do this.\u201d Anyway, he thinks back, comes back and says, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you buy 18 percent of the company in the public market and we\u2019ll do this thing? You go on the board and we\u2019ll do it.\u201d So I come into Silver Lake, we work for two months, come up with a plan that says that Apple is going to focus on consumers, it\u2019s going to do iPods and it\u2019s going to do iMacs and then they\u2019ll do other things for the digital life.", "But it\u2019s going to create a new world for PCs, one that\u2019s away from the office towards consumers and it probably grows 12, 14 percent and it\u2019ll gain some market share and everybody will be happy and we\u2019ll make a ton of money. The Apple guys will do great things. My partner said no. They said you can\u2019t make any assumption of growth for any period greater than 7 percent.", "And I\u2019m looking at him going, \u201cHang on. The company has as much cash on the balance sheet as stock price. You\u2019re taking no risk. And 7 percent still works. The math at 7 percent says this is a great investment. Why wouldn\u2019t you do it?\u201d We\u2019re not gonna do it. It cost our investors an opportunity at over $100 billion in profits. That was a little frustrating.", "Right.", "Then Bono calls up. I literally get a phone call.", "Bono shows up! Wait a second. Okay, I\u2019m teasing.", "So I knew Bono because ...", "I\u2019m gonna hurry you up. So you get to Elevate.", "Anyway, Bono calls up one day, says, \u201cRoger, I got a deal for you.\u201d And we take it to Silver Lake and they go, \u201cWe\u2019ll do the deal, but we\u2019re going to do it with Bono but not with you.\u201d And I go, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d They said, \u201cWe want you out of here.\u201d I go, \u201cOh, that\u2019s cool.\u201d", "What did you do to them, Roger?", "Wow, that\u2019s a good question. ", "I guess you\u2019re irritating.", "I think I\u2019m just annoying. Obviously, I was annoying.", "Yeah.", "But anyway, long story short, I call up Bono say, \u201cWow, I\u2019m out of the firm.\u201d He said, \u201cScrew them, we\u2019ll start our own firm.\u201d And so that day, Elevation started and then that is what leads to ...", "I recall writing about this. I\u2019m now remembering when I had to write about this fight. It was so inane.", "Yeah, yeah, yeah. And we\u2019d been through a little bit, all the way back to you at the Washington Post. So anyway, that leads us to ...", "I think I was at the Journal by this time, but yeah.", "By then it was, but you and I first met earlier than that. So anyway, the long story short is that\u2019s 2003 and that\u2019s Elevation. The following year, Mark Zuckerberg starts Facebook. ", "So tell me how you met him. And you were doing Palm, too. You weren\u2019t doing ...", "Not quite yet. Palm comes slightly afterwards. ", "Okay.", "Imagine that it\u2019s the spring of 2006. I get an email, maybe early something, I get an email from Chris Kelly, who was the chief privacy officer at Facebook. I knew Chris just a little bit and he goes, \u201cMy boss has got a really serious problem. He needs to talk to somebody who\u2019s been around a long time who\u2019s objective, basically a dinosaur.\u201d I go, \u201cWell, that sounds like me.\u201d He goes, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m calling.\u201d", "So what are you thinking? Next week, week after? He says, \u201cNo, how about 1:00 this afternoon?\u201d So Mark comes to my office. He\u2019s 22, company\u2019s two years old. They have 9 million in sales, no real business model. They\u2019re only still high school students and college students. They don\u2019t even have News Feed, but it\u2019s already obvious that he has the answer for social. ", "And to me, there were two elements. One was authenticated identity. You had to have an email address from a real thing. The second thing was he actually gave you privacy control because all there was in those days was what you put into it and you could control who saw it. And I thought that Myspace and Friendster and all these other things had failed because of a combination of anonymity, which both allows trolls to come in and also make sure network complexity a lot harder. ", "Right.", "And frankly, just a lack of focus. Mark comes into my office and I go, \u201cDude, you and I don\u2019t know each other. If you go first, you\u2019ll never trust anything I say, so let me tell you the context for me coming to this meeting.\u201d He goes, \u201cFire away.\u201d I go, \u201cIf it hasn\u2019t already happened, either Microsoft or Yahoo is going to offer a billion dollars for Facebook and everybody you know is going to tell you to take it. ", "\u201dThey\u2019re going to tell you they\u2019ll back your next company, it will be just as successful. You\u2019ll have $650 million bucks, you can change the world. And I just want you to know, Mark, I think what you have here is the most important company since Google and you will eventually be bigger than Google is today.\u201d In my mind, that would have been 100 million users and I\u2019m thinking that\u2019s outrageously big.", "Right.", "And I said, \u201cHere\u2019s one thing I know.\u201d I\u2019ve been doing this at that point 24 years. There\u2019s never been an entrepreneur who\u2019s had the perfect idea at the perfect time twice. Lots of people have had the perfect idea twice, Steve Jobs being an example, but getting the timing exactly right, that takes unbelievable good luck and it\u2019s never happened twice. I said, \u201cIt won\u2019t happen to you. I think Facebook is the single best idea of this decade. If you believe in it, you got to do it.\u201d ", "So here you are, meeting young Mark Zuckerberg. You\u2019re totally into this company. You\u2019re telling him what he wants to hear, which is don\u2019t sell to Terry Semel. Don\u2019t sell to Larry and Sergey. Keep at it, which is precisely what someone like Mark Zuckerberg wants to hear.", "And what he said to me at the time was, I asked him, \u201cDo you want to sell the company.\u201d He said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to disappoint everybody. And I said, \u201cDude, wrong ...\u201d ", "That\u2019s so like him. ", "That\u2019s the wrong frame. Well, I think his parents and all were involved. And really, a billion dollars on a $9 million revenue thing was, in those days, subsequently that became small change.", "And he had a lot of troubles. He had a lot of COO\u2019 in and out. He had a lot of CFOs. Every week there was some catastrophe.", "Some catastrophe. And so ...", "Was Microsoft in by now?", "No. No. No. This is the first one. But within six months I think he has at least two more offers. Including a second one from Yahoo.", "Right. ", "So the key thing was, I helped him understand how to communicate why he wasn\u2019t going to do it, because he had a golden vote. The entire meeting was only a half an hour. But he invited me to come back to his office, like a couple of days later, and that begins a three-year period of what I would characterize as mentoring, what others have characterized as mentoring, where I was part of this ecosystem of people he would talk to. ", "So you, Graham ... ", "Well, the top people. I was in the second tier. The top people would have been Peter Thiel. Would have been Marc Andreessen and Don Graham. ", "Washington Post. Just to be clear. Marc Andreessen was the founder of Netscape and became a venture capitalist. ", "And Peter Thiel was Peter Thiel who was the first money into Facebook. Those people had social relationships as well as business. For me, it was just a business thing. And he consulted me on a very specific set of things.", "But what was weird, at that time, those things were coming up ... not every day but certainly every week. So we were talking a lot. I was at Facebook almost every week for a few years. ", "And you had been an investor at this point? ", "No. No. No. At the beginning, I did it just because I wanted to meet the kid who was starting the thing I thought was the coolest idea since Google. ", "Elbow your way in, like most venture capitalist. ", "No. No. If I had, I would still be at Silver Lake.", "Right, that\u2019s true. ", "So what happens is that I help him deal with replacing a bunch of people. I help him deal with the Winklevi. He has that whole crisis of that story breaking. And what happens is in the summer of 2007, one of their employees has a life-changing experience and needs to get liquidity. Needs to get rid of his options. It\u2019s not even ... they aren\u2019t even real options. It\u2019s this totally synthetic thing and he needs to do a transaction. He needs to do it quickly. And he comes to me and says, \u201cWill you do it?\u201d ", "And my partners looked at it and said, \u201cLook, we can\u2019t put a thing that\u2019s that touchy-feely into the fund. But why don\u2019t you go ahead and do it?\u201d So Bono, Marc Bodnick and I bought this guy\u2019s options. ", "And Marc Bodnick is the brother in law. ", "Marc Bodnick is the brother in law of Sheryl Sandberg, and the way that I got to know Sandberg back in 2000 which is ... Sheryl is the person who introduced Bodo to me. All of these things are incredibly incestuous. ", "Right, Bodo was always in her basement, for some reason. ", "Wait, hold on. Bodo was working on the millennium debt forgiveness program. Sheryl was the US counterpart. And he wanted to find out who this guy was who was helping The Grateful Dead with their digital strategy after Jerry Garcia died and that person happened to be me. And Sheryl laughs because she goes, \u201cMy brother-in-law works for him.\u201d And so, I mean, this whole thing.", "It\u2019s such a tight ... I want you to say this because it\u2019s such a ridiculously tight social and weird connection. ", "And this book is written from the perspective of Jimmy Stewart in ", "Rear Window", ", right? It\u2019s one series of improbable coincidences after another. ", "So you go, you start working with him, and then you buy this stock out. ", "We buy this little bit of stock, right? Then almost immediately after, Sheryl calls me up and says, \u201cI am thinking of leaving Google. I\u2019ve got an opportunity to get a senior position at the Washington Post.\u201d And I go, \u201cSheryl, that is insane, okay, Google is killing these guys.\u201d ", "Meanwhile, Mark has come to me and saying I\u2019ve got to get a different COO. And a light bulb goes off and I say to Sheryl, \u201cI think you should look at Facebook.\u201d And Sheryl goes, \u201cOh come on now. He\u2019s 22. This will never work.\u201d", "And Google had become a juggernaut at this point and she was in charge of a critical part of its advertising business.", "She was part of a three-woman team that had created the monetization at Google, and AdWords I think is arguably the greatest advertising product ever created.", "What\u2019s her name? Shona? Shoana?", "No. No. No. It was Marisa and Susan.", "Susan. Susan. Okay, I thought Shoana was involved too. But go ahead. ", "My point is it was the all women\u2019s team. Okay. And they created ... I mean every ... the great thing about AdWords is that it worked for everyone. There was nothing too deceitful about it. ", "So she was in a big place. And her thought about this was? ", "Well, her initial thought was he\u2019s so much younger and his reputation was The Winklevii, right? And so where are you going to do that? And I said to her, \u201cSheryl, humor me. His mother is a doctor. He has nothing but sisters. I think he is the rare person in Silicon Valley who can work with a woman. Just take the meeting.\u201d I go to Mark, I say, \u201cI think you should get Sheryl as your COO.\u201d ", "Mark says, \u201cWell, but she\u2019s at Google, it\u2019s a totally different problem.\u201d I\u2019m going, \u201cMark, give me a thing that\u2019s closer to what Facebook is going to be than Google.\u201d I said, \u201cAnd they went from zero to look where they are? This has got to be relevant.\u201d", "So anyway, it takes like two months but they finally get together. And once they do, there is a chemistry. And it really comes together. ", "There is. ", "They team up. At which point, then you have later that year in 2008, then you\u2019ve got Beacon. Beacon was this product that Facebook created that basically followed you when you purchased stuff at retail.

I wrote about it.", "On Overstock, at a really deep discount, and Facebook publishes it on his News Feed. That is how his fiancee finds out he is going to propose. Finds out he gets this ring for 27 cents. All of his friends find out. He\u2019s humiliated. And anyway, Facebook withdrew that after a matter of months, and Sheryl and I had, shall we say, a disagreement philosophically about that. And I realized it was time for me to back off a little bit. ", "Right. Let\u2019s be clear, Roger. You can be irritating \u2014 you know what I mean? \u2014 to people. You kind of say what you think. ", "For sure. No, no.", "And they don\u2019t like that in Silicon Valley. Once they get to a certain period, you have an opinion. You have an opinion.", "It\u2019s the same problem we had at Silver Lake.

Beacon affected my relationship with Sheryl. And you know, I do describe what she says about it. She talks about being a team and succeeding and failing as a team, which is a philosophy that she holds very deeply and it worked incredibly well on the way up at Facebook.

No way to stop a problem. Nobody would speak up. There would be no incentive. Anyway, I realized it was time for me to step back. I did.

This stuff\u2019s complicated. My problem is not with social media.

I think the answer here is that these guys are like chemical companies and like energy companies that there are toxic spills that happen as a consequence of their actions. And the reason those margins are so high, the reason the stocks are so valuable, is because nobody is forcing them to pay the costs of cleaning up the messes they create. ", "That\u2019s exactly right. ", "And I believe the answer here, the way you change the incentive, the way you improve the business model is not through any other kind of regulation, it\u2019s by making them legally liable and economically liable for the consequences of what they do. ", "So in Germany today, we have a new story about ", "Germany coming down on Facebook", " because they think the data collection practices are wrong. That is a fantastic approach. Another approach would be to sit there and say anybody who has a problem with the data collection processes, why don\u2019t we sue Facebook and collect the money? I think the latter approach will move Facebook a lot faster than the regulatory would, because the lawyers will find some way to shimmy the regulatory thing, but if you make it about money ...

", "And you know, so as we look forward, the reason it\u2019s so scary is I think Facebook at the margin, I don\u2019t see the future problems coming from them nearly as much as I do from Google, Microsoft, and Amazon. Because I look at things like ... ", "Microsoft, it\u2019s interesting you added them in there. ", "Well yeah, so here\u2019s how I look at it, and they\u2019re in different categories. So there are two problems. There\u2019s IOT, Internet of Things, so smart devices with either Alexa or Google Home front ends, and then there\u2019s the whole artificial intelligence forum. And so, if we look at smart devices, you\u2019re now going to let the surveillance come into parts of your life you\u2019ve never had it before. And you know, you say it\u2019s okay in the kitchen, you go okay. And you say it\u2019s okay in the living room, is it okay in your office? Is it okay in your bedroom? Last week we got news that Nest \u2014 which is a division of Google that makes, among other things, security devices \u2014 got hacked by some dude who made a family think they were under a nuclear missile assault. ", "Mm-hmm. ", "So these things not only have a surveillance problem, they also have Android as their underlying operating system, which is relatively less secure than some other operating systems we know. And I just think we need to have a conversation about what are the limits? I don\u2019t think this notion that people can collect data anywhere, buy data anywhere, and merge it and use it with impunity, I don\u2019t think that makes sense. ", "So what happens? ", "My point is, I don\u2019t think it should be legal to sell people\u2019s location data. ", "Right. ", "I don\u2019t think the telephone carriers should be able to sell it. ", "Which they are. ", "I don\u2019t think that the bank people should be able to sell credit card data except under very strictly controlled terms. And you know, there are a whole bunch of things, nothing about kids, right? Nothing about minors. And yet they do it all the time. ", "Then we get to AI, and here you got this problem of a childish approach. ", "It needs data. ", "But you have a childish approach. Here\u2019s a situation where, you know, the obvious thing is to say, \u201cWhat do you want the world to look like?\u201d Do you want it to reproduce all of the implicit bias of the real world? I mean, think about mortgages, there\u2019s a thing called redlining where banks would historically restrict who could get a mortgage in certain neighborhoods and they might do it based on religion or race or something else. Well, if you use only the datasets of the real world to train the AI, that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to get and that\u2019s exactly what they did get. If you look at things that review resumes, jeez, in the real-world workplace, are there any biases on gender? ", "Mm-hmm. ", "Are there any biases on race? If that\u2019s the only dataset you use, they go right into it. But now, instead of a thing where there\u2019s a human right of appeal, it\u2019s a black box with no right of appeal. And I think that\u2019s deeply flawed. And you look at the facial recognition, same problem. ", "In China. The surveillance economy. ", "Okay, you\u2019ve got all these things going on in AI. So that job one in AI, let\u2019s think about the top three use cases economically today. No. 1, getting rid of white-collar work. No. 2, filter bubbles. Telling people what to think. No. 3, recommendation engines. Telling people what to enjoy or buy or share. ", "Well, I step back for a minute and I\u2019m reminded of Steve Jobs\u2019s notion of bicycles from the mind, that\u2019s about human empowerment. Our jobs, what we think, what we like, and what we buy. Those are pretty fundamental elements of what make us different, what makes us individuals. And we\u2019re going to delegate the things that make us unique to a computer. That seems like the opposite of bicycles for the mind. ", "We\u2019ve got to finish up, but what do you think is going to happen? Where are you going to leave with this? It doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re stopping at all.

", "Mm-hmm. ", "I think there\u2019ll be lots ... Steve Case is going around the country, I think lots of people are going to like this idea. Because we know technology can empower us, and why we stop doing that is simply a flaw of a certain group of people at a certain moment of time having a power to carry out their vision. And it was a genius vision on its own terms. The problem was its own terms were not inclusive enough. ", "Mm-hmm. ", "You\u2019ve known me long enough to know that one of the things that really annoys people about me is that I have this tendency to be non-hierarchical and to be relatively inclusive in comparison to people in whatever jobs I\u2019ve been in. And, you know, if you\u2019re a beneficiary of patriarchy or a beneficiary of your skin tone, that can be annoying. ", "It can be. Although the mirror comment, I got you on that one. Remember that? ", "No, and to be ...", "Just so you know, when he was doing Palm, we\u2019re not going to go into Palm, but he said there\u2019s a mirror on the bag, that ladies would like it, and I literally almost threw a shoe at your head. ", "And correctly so. Correctly so. ", "But, I get your point. ", "And somebody corrected me on a thing I said last night where I made a comment that would be typical of someone of my generation and it just was not sensitive enough and it really annoyed me that I made it. But the thing is, this is the point I want to make. We all have an opportunity to learn from this. ", "Yes, that\u2019s a 100 percent. ", "I\u2019m learning from it, I learn every day. I\u2019m learning stuff from you today, I\u2019ve learned from 10 other people today. ", "But why don\u2019t they learn it? Two things I want you to comment on to finish up. I think they\u2019re incompetent to the task, and I don\u2019t mean stupid. I think they have none of the skills that\u2019s capable of doing this, No. 1. Two, I think they see themselves as victims and they can\u2019t believe people don\u2019t like them. ", "That to me is really ... that means they\u2019re not going to learn and it seems that to me is the end of any kind of era of society when they\u2019re intolerant to criticism and they consider it attacks. Valid criticism. And at the same time they actually don\u2019t have the skills to take on these complex societal issues. ", "I think those are perfect frames. I add to the first point, the one about the skillset, I think that they believe that there is a software or an AI solution to every problem. Once you get people into a filter bubble, then they take on to believing the thing themselves. It becomes a preference bubble. You cannot cure a preference bubble with code. That requires human interaction. ", "If people are in a cult, you cannot cure that. People at Facebook and Google live in a preference bubble. They\u2019re so bought into their vision, and the vision is that code cures literally everything. No, you cannot cure ... I mean, they created a lot of the polarization in America, but they can\u2019t fix it. ", "Right. ", "And so we have to fix it for them. We have to take that responsibility away from them. And you know, I think that\u2019s not a horrible thing. ", "Who gets it? Who gets the responsibility? ", "Who receives it or who understands it? ", "Who understands and can fix it? ", "I\u2019m a big believer that you have to change the business models that I\u2019ve now concluded has to come from the outside. I\u2019m very encouraged by Congress, we have 40 new members, average age roughly 40. Congress wasn\u2019t as bad as everybody thinks before because one, Paul Manafort got raided by the FBI so you didn\u2019t see the last 90 percent of the members of Congress who got after him. And there was a lot of really good questions and Mark did not hold up well. ", "But the truth of that whole thing is, our elected officials understand there\u2019s a problem. What they need is our help to get it across the finish line. We have to tell them how important this issue is. The punch line in my book is we have way more power than we realize, because the elected officials want to make change on both sides of the aisle. They just need us to validate it. We need to be pinging them every single day. ", "Yeah. ", "Just think of this like an indivisible group. Just sit there and pick the issue you want \u2014 focus on children, focus on democracy, focus on privacy, focus on competition and innovation, it doesn\u2019t make a difference, pick the one you like \u2014 and bang on them. And bang on them hard. Tell them, you know, to read this book. ", "The other thing you could do is, remember you can change your own habits. Ask yourself this question: if I knew that by accepting a little inconvenience, I could help to restore democracy, I could improve my own mental health and that of my children, I could regain the right to make choices without fear, which is to say have real benefits of privacy, and lastly maybe even make the economy better and more interesting and more diverse, would I accept some increase in inconvenience? ", "And the point is, each of us gets to make a different decision. I\u2019m not going to tell you what to do. But, I\u2019ve shown you in this book how to do that and what I do, and then you just make your own choice. But we\u2019re all in this together. Remember, there\u2019s only a few of them. I mean, part of the problem with these companies ...", "You have a lot of money, Roger!", "No, no, but hang on. Bear with me for just a sec. ", "I\u2019m teasing. ", "They have blown up whole industries without replacing them. They\u2019ve forgotten that what Schumpeter was talking about with creative destruction was that you had responsibility when you creatively destroyed something, to rebuild something that was bigger and better and restored everybody to a happier place. And they have failed in that. They\u2019ve been irresponsible, and we now have to call them to task. And that doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re bad people, it just means that, culturally speaking, the country was in a bad place, it directed them to a worse place and now we\u2019re going to come back. ", "Right, okay. So, last question, very short. Have you talked to Mark or Sheryl since then? ", "The last time I heard from either one of them was the email on October 30th of 2016, the last time I spoke to anybody at Facebook was February 2017 and that was Alex Stamos. ", "Are you going to send them a book? Do you have any confidence that they understand this now and are trying? ", "I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know. And my point is, at this point, I\u2019m obviously the wrong messenger and so what I\u2019m really trying to do is see if I can\u2019t help to prepare somebody who\u2019s a better messenger to talk to them. I mean, people don\u2019t use ad hominem when they\u2019re ready to listen, you know? ", "Yeah. ", "And so, that\u2019s not important to me, right? ", "Okay. ", "I\u2019m worried about everybody else, okay? I\u2019m going to focus on the 99.9999999 percent and somebody else can focus on the top guys. ", "All right, Roger. This is great, you\u2019re not a crank. Stop it, Facebook. Stop calling him a crank. I appreciate it, thank you so much, it was great talking to you and we\u2019ll talk more, I think.

Before starting the company in 2014, she worked at LivingSocial \u2014 we\u2019ll talk about that \u2014 and the Obama White House. That\u2019s quite a resume, Susan. Welcome to Recode Decode.", "Thanks. I\u2019m excited to be here.", "There\u2019s so much to talk about. Unfortunately, you got me on a bad day. It\u2019s the Facebook disaster day, which is yesterday and the day before, but it was a pretty bad story in the New York Times. ", "We\u2019re gonna talk about that, being a CEO and tech responsibility, but let\u2019s talk a little bit about you, yourself, and how you started Framebridge. ", "There\u2019s not many startups started by women. We\u2019ll talk about that issue and why. I know, I\u2019m sorry, you\u2019re gonna have to carry water for all women, but there we have it because tech is such a non-diverse place.", "Let\u2019s start with your background. It\u2019s a really interesting background. You were at LivingSocial. Who was the CEO? What\u2019s his name?", "Tim O\u2019Shaughnessy.", "Tim O\u2019Shaughnessy.", "Yep.", "That\u2019s right. I remember, it was back in the day, it was a big deal. It was that and Groupon and everything else. Tell me about your background. Go through it for us.", "Sure. Before that I had been a management consultant, and then found my way really into consumer tech, sort of fintech before fintech.", "You worked for Boston Consulting or something like that?", "Accenture.", "Accenture, whatever. Same one.", "Exactly. But actually wound up doing a big project for the Postal Service in which I find myself back in a warehouse. But then sort of meandered through a few different consumer tech jobs and grew to love it. Loved the consumer orientation and the speed. Certainly, that was what I loved most about LivingSocial. I was actually in the Obama White House when friends from a previous job started LivingSocial.", "Right, and they brought it to Washington?", "Yeah, it was in Washington and I watched it and it was the most exciting thing in Washington since probably AOL.", "Yeah, right, exactly, and sort of went that way too. But all right, you went there. What were you doing in the Obama White House?", "I worked in the budget office and I had a role that was really to solve management issues that could become political issues. It wasn\u2019t a policy job. It was truly things like response to the oil spill, response to GI bill delays. The current administration\u2019s still dealing with that right now.", "Like you would look at it and say what?", "Let\u2019s look at the data, let\u2019s figure out what\u2019s happening and make recommendations, and then also have the fun of being able to say you\u2019re calling from the White House.", "Is that fun?", "Yeah.", "It is?", "What a privilege.", "What happened exactly? They go, \u201cOh!\u201d", "People responded quickly.", "They do?", "Yes.", "What do you think now? I\u2019m not going to ask your political opinion.", "I definitely was amazed at the caliber of the people. Truly, the smartest people in every field rushed in to the first administration, to Obama\u2019s first. It was an awe to be around these people and I just feel sad about that.", "Right, okay. You did that and then you decided to go off to do a startup?", "Yeah, \u2018cause I saw them building it and it looked like so much fun and yes.", "How did you get hooked up with them?", "I knew them from a previous startup. I was watching them and was sort of almost waiting to be called, maybe too prideful to say I\u2019d love to join. Someone called me and said, \u201cWe\u2019re gonna start a sort of new business line, wanna join?\u201d", "What did you do there?", "I started new deal categories, so home services, family-friendly deals, and then ultimately what is now Groupon\u2019s main business, Groupon Goods, selling products.", "Selling products itself, which LivingSocial did. Can we talk about what happened to that business? \u2018Cause it was hot, hot, hot and then both of them went under. Groupon was bigger.", "It required two sides to work and when it worked, that cycle was really supportive of one another. If merchants got good customers, then good merchants would do deals and customers would open those emails.", "When it started, I think merchants started saying, \u201cWe\u2019re ", "not", " getting good customers. We\u2019re just giving away the store.\u201d Then, premiere vendors didn\u2019t wanna be in emails, and then emails ... And then also, worse, how do you make more money in that business? We had to put more and more deals in the emails and then just for the customer, it became less and less interesting. It just sort of unraveled pretty quickly.", "Why wasn\u2019t that thought of before, speaking of management consultants?", "Yeah.", "It was the first time people had done this deal, although there have been deals, like those books that you carry around, those big heavy books that you had coupons in.", "Right. I think there were some offline versions, right, the Yellow Pages and then also there were versions of this that were ... Yelp. I mean things exist that were connecting local stores with customers and the community. There ", "was", " going to be a set of solutions to come out of that. ", "I think in some ways, I learned there\u2019s an issue when it comes too easy and I think it came too easy and then it was just like a feeding frenzy for both companies to grow as fast as possible. We didn\u2019t have to think enough about what happens next because it was coming so easy.", "Right, that you were getting deals, deals, deals and you could always have the next customer and cycle through customers. But retailers got angry pretty fast, or vendors?", "They did. But the growth was happening so fast that it all took place so quickly. It\u2019s interesting because I have since formed a company that is so fundamental. We place something of value in someone\u2019s hands and that is definitely a result.", "Right. Of that, okay. You did that and you stayed there till when? Because it started unraveling pretty quickly. How much money was put into it? One was Steve Case and one was Ted Leonsis, right?", "It was Steve. ", "This was Steve.", "Steve was LivingSocial. Both Steve and Tim, backers of Framebridge, which I think is sort of the best thing we see in tech, right?", "I left in \u201809, or sorry, I left in 2011 and it was, yeah, it hadn\u2019t ... The future was unclear, but it wasn\u2019t as exciting.", "Right, and you thought what? You wanted to go to another internet company?", "Yes, and I took a product role, head of product for a taxi app.", "All right, which one?", "Taxi Magic, which then became Curb.", "Right.", "Yep.", "Right, right, right and that was early, that was early days.", "Yes, they were actually the first to have an iPhone app to hail a taxi. Thought that would be an exciting place to be certainly because industry-wise, something was gonna happen there. But by that time, I had the idea for Framebridge and it was brewing in me.", "Explain what it is. Explain to people what that is.", "Framebridge is custom picture framing, half the time, half the price of traditional framing. We do it all centrally. We send people packaging, they send us their art or they upload a photo and we print it and frame it.", "I think really sort of two pretty obvious theses that we\u2019ve been able to prove out \u2014 which is one, if someone made this easier and more affordable, people would do it more often.", "Because framing\u2019s expensive.", "Yes.", "And it\u2019s local, it\u2019s very local.", "It\u2019s very local, it\u2019s fragmented and it should be a bigger category than it is.", "Right.", "We truly believed it was constrained because of the price and the way it was delivered.", "There are a few chains, right? Not many.", "The craft chains, yeah. But really it was that younger customers should love this too. They like experiences, they create amazing content, why wouldn\u2019t they also? They would, it\u2019s just the way in which it was delivered wasn\u2019t appealing to them.", "Then the second part, which I didn\u2019t know how we would do, but since we have, was I\u2019m sure if we aggregate all this demand, we can somehow deliver it in a way that is less expensive.", "Right.", "That\u2019s really by streamlining our operations by bringing manufacturing best practices to this industry that had not been brought there before.", "Talk about that. Why wasn\u2019t it? Why did you come up with it? Why was it framing that you got interested in?", "Personal need. I had four national parks posters, I took \u2018em to a frame store, they cost $400 each to be framed and I thought $1,600 for a poster seemed crazy. And I started talking to everybody about the idea and everybody had a similar story: Delight at what they framed and sticker shock from the experience.", "But why this? I like to get the idea of what someone decides at the moment you decided, \u201cWhy, I think frames. Yes, frames.\u201d", "Yeah, no, because it was broken. Truly, and because the first ... Every time you ask someone about what they framed, they tell you about the sticker shock and then the second question is, well tell me about it and they say, \u201cActually, I went to Nepal and let me tell you.\u201d People have stuff they love.", "The thing they\u2019re doing, right. You said, \u201cOkay, this is what I\u2019m gonna do\u201d?", "This is what I\u2019m gonna do. Oh, but the reason I did it was because I was in this taxi business and I thought here\u2019s a problem with what, at the time, hilariously, we thought was a $15 billion market size, but every smart person in the country is working on it. I thought I have an idea that I believe in so much that no one is working on. Why wouldn\u2019t I go do that?", "That would worry people though, like, \u201cOh, nobody\u2019s working on it.\u201d", "That\u2019s the first thing they always say, but I think that\u2019s only because you had to have the reverence for design, some tech understanding, and some willingness to figure out the manufacturing. It was really just could you put all the pieces together?", "Right, and so you started off. Okay, you\u2019re one of the few women as a CEO.", "Yep.", "This is your idea. How did you create it? What did you do?", "I was in my late 30s when I started it, so I joke a little bit, I did it like a woman that was totally prepared at the time I started. I was able to raise ... I raised money out of the gate and I raised money from people who knew me as a manager from other jobs.", "Right, so Steve Case.", "I was a known entity to them in that capacity.", "How much did you raise at that time?", "At that time, I raised about one and a half, it was at $3 million seed in two tranches. ", "You were trying to find investors like a Steve Case or Tim who had worked with you at LivingSocial or elsewhere?", "That\u2019s right.", "Who wouldn\u2019t bother you, really. Who trusted you.", "You had to believe two things. You had to believe this was a category worthy of disruption \u2014 which obviously a lot of investors did not believe \u2014 and then you had to believe I could get it done.", "Right, so talk about that process. Again, I don\u2019t wanna focus on you\u2019re a woman but there aren\u2019t many women CEOs. There just aren\u2019t. I can count them on my hands. One hand.", "No, I think it\u2019s interesting, even though this would obviously be an industry I might be interested in, I think the fact that it\u2019s a crafty industry is a double whammy.", "It\u2019s a lady industry.", "Totally, so I think there\u2019s both a lack of understanding of it but also when I went out there, I think there was somewhat of a question of my ambition. Like, I wanted to build a very large business and this is how I was gonna do it, but I think paired with a mom going out and pitching a frame business, you had to know me to know that I was gonna get it done.", "That\u2019s why, I mean, I pitched to everyone under the sun on both coasts but wound up with people who knew me.", "Talk about the difficulties of pitching, because I want people to get a sense of what that\u2019s like.", "I laughed ... One day in two different cities, I got the exact same anecdote, which was I don\u2019t understand the use case. If I\u2019m in Aspen with my friends, I would take a picture, and I could frame it. I thought, this is amazing. I\u2019m in two different cities in the same day and that was the only use case you could come up with.", "Because they go to Aspen, these douchey VCs.", "Yes, and there\u2019s also a lot of, \u201cI asked my wife and we have a decorator and we wouldn\u2019t need it.\u201d", "Mm-hmm. Oh man, I hate these guys.", "It\u2019s really amazing. Then, I used to actually report back from the road and I remember my mom took an interest in this and would say, \u201cDid you meet any women today?\u201d Always, I\u2019m like, \u201cNo, mom, of course not.\u201d", "Of course not, yeah, it was all dudes.", "Although one of my original investors is from NEA Partners, a woman.", "Right, okay. You had to get them around the idea, one, that it\u2019s a good idea, and two, that you could do it?", "Yes. You had to say, yeah, it\u2019s a big enough category and I can get it done.", "Right, right. What was your biggest argument? Pitch me. That you could do it.", "It\u2019s still my biggest, how many industries are left that haven\u2019t been transformed by the internet? I found one!", "I found one.", "Then I think the wind at our backs in terms of all the content people are taking on their phone.", "Right, exactly.", "Obviously there\u2019s all this stuff ...", "People want an analog version of this.", "Yes, and I think it\u2019s gonna be really hard for you to convince me people won\u2019t wanna pull things down from the cloud and live with them in their real lives. Of course they do. That\u2019s understandable.", "Was there another example like it? That people had done that with?", "People who\u2019d done the same ...", "There was a lot of framing, you pull down clouds into a digital frame.", "Oh, into a digital frame, yeah.", "That came and went. I had 17 of those.", "Yeah, I don\u2019t even see it as a substitute for what we do. There really is some significance and people get an emotional reaction to ...", "To art or that they created.", "Yes. I think ... Interesting, I will give us credit for this. We had product market fit when we launched and we started selling \u2018cause it made sense.", "That\u2019s the other thing, this is interesting with pitching. I\u2019ve only gotten east coast money. I really think there is something sort of fundamental, clear about what we\u2019re doing and we have interesting stuff to say.", "Absolutely, we are growing the category. This is net new business. That\u2019s cool. But it\u2019s not, it\u2019s too tangible. I think I really struggled with that. It was like, I get it, but what\u2019s most interesting to a hot topic on people\u2019s data. But what\u2019s really interesting is you know what people value in their lives. We definitely do. We know if you got married or if you love dogs.", "But what\u2019s most interesting is that we provide this service in a much smoother way and you\u2019re gonna incorporate it in your life more. But I definitely think there are investors who want something more. I actually remember an investor saying, A) it wasn\u2019t sexy enough. They try and do sexier stuff and B) it just seemed like a line drive. It\u2019s just too obvious.", "A line drive. What a bunch of idiots. When you raised this money, talk about the ... I like when entrepreneurs talk about the challenges they face. You raise this money, you locate in Washington, right?", "Yes.", "You have everything here and it\u2019s a little bit like ... I\u2019m trying to think of a business, probably Stitchfix or some others. Very much centralized and then they go out. Your big problem would be marketing, correct? Getting people to use it.", "Every day it\u2019s lining up supply and demand, \u2018cause we actually have to, unlike other companies, we actually have to build everything we sell.", "Right.", "Yes, it\u2019s both. We had to build it all together at the same time. I had pulled in a couple folks, sort of the best people I knew from places I had worked and the second, close the funding, hire them on. So then we started working on everything all at once. ", "By that time we had done some of the product development of that app, but we built the website, we found a warehouse, right outside of D.C., we located ourselves in the warehouse and then we truly had to, I had originally told investors that we would outsource the framing from the beginning, because we didn\u2019t know anything about framing, but ...", "Where would you have outsourced it to?", "Right, it was just to prove the concept. It was like our MVP would be, we just have the website, and we\u2019d actually just work with local framers and fulfill it, and it would all be behind the scenes.", "Like what, like florists?", "Right, but that wasn\u2019t the whole business plan. That was just to prove it, so that I didn\u2019t scare people about what we were gonna do.", "I love all the casual lying that entrepreneurs have to do. No, I\u2019m kidding. You know what I mean.", "No, no, no. It was an evolution.", "All right. Okay. Oh, nice, well said.", "But it happened really quickly. We did not do that with one frame. I started meeting with framers and I thought, \u201cWait a minute. What am I doing?\u201d", "Why?", "I can get equipment, we can do this.", "Right. Why did you think that?", "For all of the reasons that it was possible to come in, well, one, they didn\u2019t have any storage. If we were talking to vendors and there was another, there was someone else in the value chain, why were we doing this whole thing? It just seemed, and most importantly, we couldn\u2019t control quality, and we couldn\u2019t start getting faster, or smarter faster. From the very, very first frame, we launched everything together. We got used equipment. We hired some framers, and we launched our website.", "So, and you decided hire some framers to work for you directly?", "Yes.", "Right. And getting the actual things you need to make a frame and offer them kind of things.", "Yes.", "How difficult was that? Because you\u2019re going against local people, right? What was the reception?", "Yeah, so, not good. I think, I mean from consumers, consumers got it, we have a very clear value prop. Sort of ...", "Oh, I get it. I\u2019ve spent $4 million on framing.", "So people are, \u201cI got it.\u201d And then now, increasingly with social proof, people trust us, and they get it. Certainly the industry was suspicious. We came in saying \u2014 and I believe it \u2014 this is new demand and I think we\u2019ve been able to prove that for the most part.", "This is people that weren\u2019t getting framed.", "This is people who were not. A third of our customers had never framed something before, and 65 percent of the items, they say they would not have framed otherwise.", "So, you\u2019re trying not to piss them off, you\u2019re disrupting ...", "Well, that\u2019s not what I came in to do.", "Right.", "I came in to get this to more people because I thought people would actually get stuff.", "What had been the problem, and why is this a disruptable industry?", "Most people, well, know local framers don\u2019t actually store any inventory, so they buy from distributors when you choose off of that wall of 10,000 frame styles.", "Right.", "So, it\u2019s expensive and takes time.", "Meaning? Explain that.", "Meaning, so, there\u2019s a wall of 10,000 frame styles, you choose, they measure your art, then they order from a distributor the materials in little chopped up pieces to come to their store, and so that takes a couple weeks and it\u2019s expensive, it\u2019s heavily marked up. So we said, we\u2019ll essentialize all this, we\u2019ll order in high quantities, and we\u2019ll make things ourselves. Out of the gates, we were able to offer at a lower price.", "Lower price, and so the premise would be that this shouldn\u2019t cost as much, but you have less selection, right? You don\u2019t have 10,000...", "We do. We have 50 frame styles, but we added some attractive ... And also the way in which the original industry worked, because products didn\u2019t cycle through quickly, it didn\u2019t even keep up with home d\u00e9cor trends. It really wasn\u2019t ... just a lot of value the customer wasn\u2019t getting. Which was even design advice you\u2019d necessarily believe in.", "Right, right. So how many people do you have working here?", "450.", "Wow. ", "In", " Washington?", "No. We have about 70 people in Washington, and the rest in Lexington, Kentucky.", "Wow, well I wanna talk about that in a second.", "Yes.", "And then the idea is that you\u2019re bringing it to places that, you\u2019re doing what Amazon didn\u2019t do, I guess. Hiring people in areas that nobody expected.", "Oh, yes, of course.", "Yes, yes, but of course. HQ2, have you heard about that?", "Yes, most recently, yes. Right, right, right. That\u2019s exactly right.", "So how do you operate? The company, then, is done in, so most of it, probably making of it, is in Lexington?", "That\u2019s right.", "And then everything, instead of here. So then the challenges you face is, presumably, marketing it and getting people to use it.", "That\u2019s right.", "And getting people to use it again and again.", "That part we have, and that has been why we\u2019ve been able to successfully fundraise, and sort of the wow of our business. It answers a lot of the open questions people have at the beginning, which was, I don\u2019t get this, I do it once every 10 years when I move, and we said, no, no, no, truly, by making it better, the category will be bigger. So that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been able to prove out. People repeat and repeat with frequency, they give it as a gift, and we see and hear people saying they\u2019re looking for things now.", "Looking for things, so, to frame?", "To frame.", "To frame. All right. So, what do you spend your days doing? You raise more money.", "Yup.", "Correct.", "Hiring. And really, the customer standard is really my life, is making sure that we\u2019re delivering the best product for our customer.", "How do you do that?", "Well, I feel, a lot, I feel, just basic, almost unease in a great way that we\u2019ve, that we\u2019ve framed 600,000 items. We know a lot about what people should be framing. We should be using that to make a better and better and better experience.", "Well, that\u2019s presumably the idea behind Amazon and everything else.", "Right. ", "The data gives you that information.", "And why on Earth would we let ourselves lose this lead? I truly, at the end of the day, just want people to love what they framed, and I believe that grows a bigger, better business. All of the entrepreneurs I admire are obsessed with it, with the same thing, so that\u2019s things from the product interactions and the physical product, to making sure things we\u2019re doing to streamline in the warehouse, just make a better experience, not in any way a degraded one. And then, yeah, making sure everything we do represents who we are, and that always feels like whack-a-mole.", "Right, right. And you, as the leader, tell us about some of the challenges you might face, and if they\u2019re different from being a woman or not.", "So, it\u2019s interesting, I think there\u2019s something, in some ways ...", "Where are you from, by the way?", "Cleveland. Can you tell?", "That\u2019s what I thought, I\u2019m like, yeah, I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat kind of accent?\u201d It\u2019s a plum, right? It\u2019s a plum? That\u2019s what they call it.", "Yeah, it is. Cleveland\u2019s a, it was New York is the Big Apple, and Cleveland\u2019s a plum.", "Uh huh, okay.", "So, I think, sometimes, no, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s harder being a leader as a ... I think being a leader ...", "Talk about the challenge of being a leader.", "Emotional intelligence, I think, is obviously critical to being a good leader. I think, generally, I think women often have a leg up there, so I think that\u2019s fine. And I think I\u2019ve been able to recruit some other great leaders as well. So it\u2019s pretty good. I think being a sole founder ...", "There\u2019s often two people.", "Yes, can be challenging just because, sort of, the weight of the world ...", "Right, is on you.", "Yes, I have a very talented COO now, takes some of that weight off, but I think, sort of the, this is why we got into this, this is why we built this, all of that is one person. I think that can be a lot. And now, yeah, I have a tremendous obligation to our employees, our investors.", "So, how much have you, total, raised now?", "67 million.", "Whoa. And then where did you go the second time?", "So, same investors, Revolution, NEA and Swan & Legend, a couple times, and then we raised our C in the spring from T. Rowe Price.", "Oh, that\u2019s interesting. Henry Elgin bought in.", "Yes.", "He would love this.", "Yes. He\u2019s amazing, and he has such a fundamental view on things, like, this makes sense, you\u2019re delivering for customers, they like you, keep doing that and I can understand how this will be successful. It was such a, as I said, east coast, it was such a refreshing perspective on our business.", "Well, you know, what\u2019s interesting is a lot stuff definitely doesn\u2019t get analog stuff. Talk to me about that a little bit, because it\u2019s the analog part of it, it\u2019s a thing.", "It\u2019s a thing and it will always be a thing. Truly, there was, I remember a pitch meeting in which someone said, but really it could be, like, \u201cWhat\u2019s the social element to it?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cOh yeah. This is how people share. Blah blah blah.\u201d They\u2019re like, \u201cNo, no, no, but what\u2019s the social element to it?\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cWell, not really, because it\u2019s in your house.\u201d", "Right, it doesn\u2019t talk to anybody. Couldn\u2019t the frames speak to each other and then the Russians somehow get in your living room, or something like that? So there\u2019s no social element. I know why I like you. Today, I\u2019m so up to my fucking eyeballs in all this shit.", "Well, I don\u2019t know if you wanna talk about that ...", "I do.", "... but it\u2019s interesting as a direct-to-consumer company, we could only exist because we could efficiently market in the early days.", "Right, right.", "And, so, the only way we could go from zero to a real company was the audience and targeting sophistication of Facebook. It\u2019s interesting because, I\u2019ve discussed my multiple lives, when I look back, that\u2019s really okay if just people who might want picture frames hear about Framebridge. It\u2019s really less okay if real debates and policy issues we should be having as a country are being inserted into specific peoples minds.", "Into frames. Say, \u201cIt just hangs on the wall.\u201d", "Just hangs on the wall.", "That\u2019s all it does.", "Did you see the Banksy frame? That was the most exciting, did you not see this? It was the most exciting thing on the news.", "No, no. Tell me. All right, explain it to me.", "Banksy developed a frame that shredded the art.", "Oh, right. Yes, of course. Yes, yes, I did. I\u2019m sorry.", "Yes, yes, after it was bought at auction. But we were really excited because there\u2019s not a lot of exciting news in our category.", "Right. There\u2019s not a ... framing isn\u2019t the place to be.", "No, but that really ...", "No, yeah.", "It was.", "Did you, are you selling that frame?", "No, but we should.", "You should. Like a shredding ... so you just keep putting art in it?", "Yeah, no, well, now it dangles from the bottom. I mean, that\u2019s part of the art.", "Okay. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m just very literal. I like \u201cit hangs on the wall.\u201d It just hangs. I can see in Silicon Valley, they\u2019d be like, \u201cWhat?\u201d", "No, come on. New market. We created a new market.", "I\u2019m saying they\u2019re idiots. I\u2019m saying you\u2019re brilliant.", "Thank you, thank you.", "I\u2019m sorry. ", "And it makes people happy. It truly does. It is a fundamental good product.", "Talk about what it\u2019s like being a startup right now, because I think a lot of startups, it\u2019s a very fallow period for startups. They\u2019re aren\u2019t any very exciting ones coming along. You had the Airbnb, Uber, Pinterest gang, but not since then. There\u2019s been a very slow moving train. I think it\u2019s because the big companies are dominating everything.", "I think that\u2019s right, and I\u2019m in e-commerce, so there\u2019s just like these digitally native brands, a lot of them, and a lot of them are really cool marketers. I think that\u2019s fun, I think it\u2019s been fun to see that that\u2019s a relationship with the customer that is so different from the old way. I look at those companies and admire them. Sometimes I\u2019m jealous of those companies, because ...", "Such as? Like a ...", "Yeah, like all of the companies, you could focus really only on marketing because we have had to scale custom manufacturing. We\u2019ve had to invent things that don\u2019t exist.", "Right, right.", "So a lot of our time and focus has been on that less glamorous side.", "Right, which is how do we get the frame \u2014 you\u2019re more like Amazon.", "But the defensible, the defensible side.", "Yeah, yeah, the moats, I call it the moats, and Amazon has moats and moats. They have data moats, they\u2019ve got manufacturing moats, they\u2019ve got packaging moats, customer service ...", "Right, so we unwrap packaging and inside it might be 10 Disney passes or it might be an old diploma on vellum, and our team has to use our software to make a series of decisions on how that should be framed, and then the rest of the factory has to be powered like a real factory. So, that\u2019s not easy.", "No, no, it\u2019s an actual manufacturing, it\u2019s another analog problem. And then you also have to go through customer service to get it back and forth. How do you look, who do you look up for then? It\u2019s gotta be Amazon, right?", "Oh, sure. We have team members who\u2019ve been at Amazon who are terrific, and have learned a tremendous amount of ... There\u2019s so much that we admire there. I think for us, though, we have to look at, in an Amazon world, why do you exist?", "Yes, I was gonna get to that next.", "Deep knowledge of our category.", "Right.", "Could they do it eventually if they wanted to? They can do anything they wanted to.", "Right, yeah. They just did microwaves, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re gonna get to you yet.", "No, they\u2019re not gonna get to us.", "You\u2019re down on, you\u2019re number 212 on that list of killing off retail.", "We\u2019re in a category that doesn\u2019t have a beloved brand and deserves one because we touch stuff you love, and there\u2019s a trust and design element.", "Right.", "So, all of that means we can compete, and we can build something that people believe in and incorporate it into their lives. I think, really for us, it\u2019s being very disciplined, about being very dedicated to this category.", "I don\u2019t think they\u2019re coming for you. I don\u2019t think so.", "They\u2019re coming to Washington though, as you said. Halfway, half of them.", "Yes. I understand that, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019re coming, I can\u2019t see them up in Seattle where they\u2019re ", "real", " headquarters is, not HQ2, I can\u2019t imagine them thinking it\u2019s a big enough category for them. You know what I mean?", "No, it was a hidden gem.", "And it\u2019s too hard and it\u2019s too, it\u2019s big, but it\u2019s not big enough. So, therefore, microwaves. Oh, I see microwaves, I see furniture, I see anything else, but that\u2019s ...", "It\u2019s also interesting because they haven\u2019t done a lot that requires design and service.", "Service. Yeah, I mean, they\u2019re doing it in the studios, but it\u2019s a little bit of a disaster over there, but, you know what I mean. It\u2019s a much more difficult business, and certainly doesn\u2019t make a lot of money, and so they ... The cloud and their packing up of consumer goods is relatively easy.", "Their focus on the customer though, amazing.", "Talk about the move towards analog, because I think that\u2019s a big area. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s in e-commerce, these, I guess Uber is an analog business in a lot of ways.", "Yeah, that\u2019s true.", "But Uber, Lyft or others, talk about that concept, because I think so much more of the next year has to do with analog, whether it\u2019s salads, or things ...", "I love those guys. I think that ..", "The Sweetgreens guys, I just was with them, yeah, they have a beautiful headquarters. They talk about salads, I know, they talk about salad like it\u2019s the second coming or something.", "But, you know what?", "It is. Okay.", "Well, they have the best ones.", "Yup, that\u2019s true. I have to say, I went to eat there afterwards, and I tried to sneak in, they ended up buying my lunch for me, but it was delicious. I was like, \u201cThis is a delicious freaking salad, Steve Case,\u201d yeah, whatever it was, I don\u2019t remember.", "I think, customers intracity using technology to make people\u2019s lives easier, I think, obviously, I think the analog stuff is all about ease, right, in our busy lives. We keep crowding our lives with more, but certainly, even Framebridge came because I wanted nice things but didn\u2019t have the time to figure them out on my own, in addition to not being able to afford it. I think that\u2019s what everything will be now. I think there\u2019s also, the beauty of the analog is, it\u2019s a market that exists.", "Right.", "Sure, we\u2019re saying it\u2019s new demand, but it\u2019s still, it\u2019s something you can believe versus a solution in search of a problem.", "Meaning? Explain that.", "Well, I think some technology businesses like, there really isn\u2019t, it might not have needed to have existed.", "Right, right. And to fix it and stuff like that. So, when you think about that, you said you found this gem to disrupt, how many more are left?", "Oh, yeah, I don\u2019t, some are really hard, people keep mentioning things.", "Like?", "Well, you were talking to Elon about construction, I thought, \u201cOh, that\u2019s really interesting.\u201d", "Right, yes, I\u2019m correct.", "Yes, that I think you are, and I was thinking about what we do in terms of custom manufacturing, and I think there\u2019s a lot more there.", "Yes. Construction has to change. It\u2019s insane how slow it is. How artisanal it is. The guy comes to your house and puts in drywall. ", "Right.", "It makes no sense. That wall could have been made somewhere else.", "Also, all of the information asymmetry. I think any time the customer doesn\u2019t know what they\u2019re getting and doesn\u2019t know who to trust.", "Yes.", "You should look into that.", "I renovated several houses, I stay there and stare at them, because I learned it all, but I was fascinated by it. They were like, \u201cYou can\u2019t customize it.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cBut ", "could", " you customize it?\u201d Sure you could. You could make that drywall to a specification. Why does it have to be made by one guy who they hire? You know what I mean? And it\u2019s always a guy, but why can\u2019t they be pre-wired and brought in?", "Well, I think there are a lot of industries where making things seem harder than they are is part of the whole deal.", "Yes. I see why they\u2019re doing it that way, although I don\u2019t think thinking beyond it. Construction is one of them, 100 percent, the way we build houses has gotta change. It\u2019s ridiculous. So what areas do you move into, or is it just a big enough business to do it?", "Right now it\u2019s a big enough business. We have tons more opportunity, and people, as I said, are framing a lot more often, a lot more people to reach here and internationally. ", "Do you have any international business then? ", "We don\u2019t today. So we have a lot of opportunity. Yeah, and truly I sort of won\u2019t be constrained by today\u2019s market size. I really think that was just very powerful.", "What is that size?", "It\u2019s like 45 billion in the U.S. but that\u2019s all the offline stuff, and of course half of our business is digital, and it\u2019s new, truly, people are framing everything, it\u2019s like company mission statements ... ", "What\u2019s the weirdest thing?", "Company marathon bib, a ponytail, umbilical cord. A pretzel. ", "What? Really? What do you do when they get there?", "You wear gloves. ", "Okay, I\u2019m still back at ponytail. Okay, all right, so did they tell you? Did they warn you of a ponytail?", "They did. Customer service knew. ", "Knew it was coming?", "Yeah, for the ponytail they knew. Yep.", "Wow, the umbilical cord now.", "Yeah.", "Whoa. I\u2019m trying to like that, but I can\u2019t.", "Right. That one maybe, but you can like the little baby hats from the hospital, c\u2019mon, or the bracelet.", "Okay.", "That\u2019s good stuff.", "I have them in a box. I have that in a box. I do not have the umbilical cord in a box.", "Well. Think about it. I get excited about the potential market for the business when two things happen: Either I see something that has just so much emotional depth behind it, and people share these stories with us. So someone sent us a charcoal painting, a drawing, and she said \u201cMy neighbor drew this of me to build me up after our hard divorce.\u201d I was like, that is really nice, and whoa, and so when we realize we\u2019re dealing with things that matter to people, and have such significance, I realize there\u2019s a big business here, and a meaningful one.", "I think when we realize we\u2019re part of anything happening in the culture, so we saw last Super Bowl, one of our product managers was pulling the feed of what people were framing, and all of a sudden it\u2019s Eagles fans, right?", "Right.", "And you realize you\u2019re in a stadium, and you\u2019re celebrating something, and you\u2019re thinking about commemorating that.", "Right.", "That\u2019s so different for this category that would have been like, 10 years later. \u201cI should have done something about, remember that time we went to the Super Bowl?\u201d And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s deluding ourselves to think that what we\u2019re doing is helping people remember good stuff in their life.", "Right.", "Before they forget about it.", "Right. So you\u2019re doing something that\u2019s analog. Do you see a market in these virtual frames? They came and went. Why? Tell me. ", "No, and well sure I do as a substitute. I guess I just said it wasn\u2019t, but yeah sure. It\u2019s something you put on your wall. I don\u2019t worry about the lack of wall space as an issue. It\u2019s ephemeral. The whole point is pulling something down to store. ", "Actually, there\u2019s an NYU professor who\u2019s done some research on the difference in the photos you post versus the photos you print. ", "Oh. ", "And of course they\u2019re a total different set of photos.", "So what are they? Tell me.", "Well, things you deeply value versus your made-up phony life. ", "Oh you know I could go on about Instagram, the performative nature of Instagram. Recently, I stopped using Instagram, because I think I hate it. I love Kevin Systrom, who founded it, but I just hate it, because it\u2019s so not true. It\u2019s true, but not true. ", "It\u2019s interesting, because it\u2019s only visual. Yeah.", "Everybody\u2019s really happy, and I know a lot of happy people, but not that many happy people, who will have moments of happiness and moments of sadness, and so one day I put all really negative pictures on Instagram and it really freaked people out. \u201cHere\u2019s a bag of urine I found on the street of San Francisco,\u201d which is very common, and I just kept taking pictures of bags of urine and bottles of urine. ", "I have to tell you, Instagram is a platform. ", "I\u2019m gonna send that to frame it for you.", "Well, it wouldn\u2019t be the weirdest thing.", "Oh, c\u2019mon. ", "No it wouldn\u2019t. ", "If I sent you a bag of urine? Please frame it.", "Oh I thought it was a photo of a bag of urine, in which case it wouldn\u2019t be the weirdest thing.

It was just part of an era. It was part of an era.", "No. It actually made some sense.", "Yeah.", "We used a lot of data to program our games.

We ultimately ...", "There was a bunch of companies like you.", "Yeah. We were ultimately acquired by Google, but it wasn\u2019t a very successful ride after about three-and-a-half years. I stayed at Google for about two weeks and got persuaded to join this company called Square, which hadn\u2019t launched yet. It was about 17 to 20 employees. Jack Dorsey had founded it and then funded it, and was working on launching it, and I got recruited to join, decided to do that, went through kind of a rocket ride, actually, very reminiscent of my PayPal days, and then eventually joined Vinod, who had been on my board, Vinod Khosla, at Square, joined him as a managing director at Khosla Ventures, and believe this or not, March of 2013 to almost six years ago, which is an eternity.", "It\u2019s a long time, right.", "Yeah, it\u2019s an eternity.", "Yeah. I never thought you\u2019d become a venture capitalist. You were sort of an operator.", "Well, I was an operator, but I was always angel investing for about a decade before. From about 2003 to about 2013, I\u2019d probably invested in about 80 companies, and I actually enjoyed the process of meeting with very early-stage entrepreneurs who were talking about the proverbial two kids in a garage, found a lot of really interesting companies before other people knew they existed, developed a bit of a track record and enjoyed that, and sort of always thought that one day, I\u2019d want to be a venture capitalist, and decided finally, in 2013 to take the stress out of my life, which when you\u2019re operating a company, every day, there\u2019s a crisis. Jeff Jordan taught me a long time ago that one percent ...", "This is Jeff Jordan from OpenTable.

Someone used to call them \u201cbig, giant babies\u201d to me, but ...", "Yeah. So, after 13 years of suffering through a crisis every single day and kind of the sine wave of emotions, I decided to be a venture capitalist, which at least smooths out those waves. It had less adrenaline and longer feedback cycles, but the day-to-day ebbs and flows are no longer your problem.", "Why did you pick Khosla? What was the ... There\u2019s a lot of different venture firms, and this is pre-SoftBank, when Andreessen Horowitz had existed. Right? They had ...", "Yeah. Andreessen I think was started around 2008 or \u201809.", "Right. Yeah.", "So, as I mentioned, Vinod Khosla, who founded the firm, was on my board at Square, so I knew him quite well. Also, David Weiden, who\u2019s another general partner at KV today, had been on my board at Slide, so two of my three GPs, really, had been on my board for the last five or six years, and I think that\u2019s a very healthy way to start a venture relationship, because you really need to have a lot of trust and confidence in each other. You don\u2019t see each other that much. We typically see each other only on Mondays, and yet-", "Right. So, talk about ... Khosla\u2019s different, because every venture firm is different. Some go for the whole group thing. Some think of other things. You guys are sort of independent players. Right?", "We are independent, in many ways. We take feedback from each other and really learn a lot from each other, which is the benefits of being in a partnership. We also, though ... One other distinction that I really thought would be meaningful is we like to take technical risk, so we invest as early as possible. We try to be bold in our bets as early as possible and as impactful as possible, and I wanted to do more technically founded investments.", "So, what does that mean to you?", "It means that the core risk is the technology. Can this actually happen? Can this be done? So, for example, a very popular topic would be, can you build an autonomous-driving automobile? That\u2019s a technical risk. The market is there. If someone could deliver, for a reasonable price point, an autonomous vehicle, there\u2019s definitely people who will buy that, but the question is, can you do it? How accurately can you do it? How many miles of data do you need? How many years is it gonna take? ", "What are the perverse side effects of deploying driverless cars? But 40,000 Americans die every year in automotive accidents, and about 40 to 60 percent are completely preventable. It\u2019s because the driver is distracted with his or her phone, with drugs or alcohol, with talking to their passenger, but there\u2019s no doubt that if the technology exists, there\u2019s something to do with it ...", "There would be a market. Right.", "... where sometimes you\u2019re taking market risk, which is, it\u2019s very easy to see that the technology will work, but no one cares. No one wants to buy it. So, we take a lot of technology risk, and that was different for me, but I was excited to learn about that, and it allowed me to branch out into areas that I hadn\u2019t been involved in \u2014 let\u2019s say healthcare investing, which I was really interested in. ", "The healthcare system\u2019s a complete mess in the US, and probably globally. There hasn\u2019t been a lot of innovation recently, and I thought that I\u2019d want to spend the next decade of my life diving into new areas like that, and as a result, actually, the last six years I\u2019ve spent about maybe 25 percent of my time and money investing in healthcare innovation, which is something I\u2019d never been able to do before.", "Mm-hmm. So, you were looking for just technical solutions versus market. You do do investments in both things, but Khosla\u2019s different.", "Oh, I do both, but I felt ...", "What would you say you sell to investors when you do it?", "Yeah, sure. Well, the thing that I actually have done for almost 20 years now is I invest primarily in founders, so I\u2019m really a people-based investor, and so I\u2019m basically assessing the opportunity that the people in front of me have of changing the world. If you think about how ridiculous Silicon Valley is in some ways, on a rational basis, it\u2019s completely ridiculous to wake up in the morning and say, \u201cI\u2019m going to change an entire industry that\u2019s been around for centuries,\u201d but it happens all the time.", "People succeed, but it is kind of irrational and kind of ridiculous to start that way. So, my core expertise is once in a while being correct about meeting someone who\u2019s 19 years old or 25 years old or an immigrant that\u2019s never done anything, has no traditional credentials, and saying, \u201cYou know what? This person actually may be able to do that, and I\u2019m gonna give them my time, my money, and my credibility, lend them it, and see if they can pull it off.\u201d And I\u2019ve been right somewhere between 30 percent to 40 percent of the time, which is actually pretty good in investing.", "So, when you\u2019re thinking about sort of this scene right now, from when you started to today, talk a little bit about the landscape now, because a lot of things have happened. You had Andreessen Horowitz, which sort of burst onto the scene, and Khosla have been around for a long time, but still, you had ... Vinod has a huge personality and also a huge reputation, but it was mostly business as usual until just recently with SoftBank\u2019s entrance with the Vision Fund, the giant, massive fund that they brought in.", "Well, I think SoftBank\u2019s had radical implications on the late-stage, the growth round, so to speak. What we do at Khosla is more early-stage, what I think of as traditional venture capital, which is a seed financing or a Series A round, where obviously, SoftBank\u2019s been deploying a ", "lot", " of capital in big bets, in mostly late-stage investments, and it has had significant impact in the entire ecosystem.", "So, talk about that.", "I think it\u2019s deferred some companies\u2019 aspirations of going public. I think it\u2019s created a crutch for other companies that really don\u2019t have an economic model that\u2019s working, and it\u2019s created a bank account that people can tap into and not have to solve their business problems. ", "I personally believe that scarcity to capital is a good thing, that desperation breeds innovation, and that you need constraints to actually execute well and innovate. If someone gives you this pile of money, I think it creates a lot of excuses and soft thinking. To some extent, this is what happened to us at Slide. We raised one of the first monster growth rounds.", "What was it? It was enormous, right?", "Well, it was basically Fidelity and T. Rowe.", "That\u2019s right. It was Henry Ellenbogen.", "Yeah. We raised a $50 million round in 2008, and that was kind of unprecedented, actually, for a private company, for public-stage investors, and I think it made us a little sloppy in several ways. We thought we had sort of infinite resources and infinite time, and it didn\u2019t force us to solve our fundamental issues right away. ", "So, I think that that is likely to happen with a lot of companies that SoftBank invests in. I think they\u2019ve invested in some very good companies that are clearly gonna be successful, and they\u2019ve invested in a lot of companies that probably have some fundamental sort of root-cause problems, and giving them a lot of money isn\u2019t probably going to solve them.", "Right. So, with the theory behind it, what do you think of this theory of just throwing hundreds of millions of dollars and those kind ... because it does create, even if it doesn\u2019t affect you, it does create a mentality up and down the system.", "I agree with that on two fronts. So, I think the mentality of throwing money at companies and making them successful just doesn\u2019t work. I\u2019ve never seen real examples of just, you take money and you crown a winner. That\u2019s the philosophy, which I don\u2019t believe that works. I think that\u2019s the whole history of Silicon Valley, is that these upstarts with very limited resources and a bunch of misfits have rearranged every single industry, and they\u2019ve done it over and over again. ", "Every time someone thinks somebody in Silicon Valley is dominant, whether it\u2019s Yahoo, or before that, AOL or whoever, they get upended by a new startup that\u2019s a bunch of your dropouts that have a very limited amount of dollars, and so I just don\u2019t believe that money is the ... It\u2019s not the panacea, and it\u2019s certainly not the keys to the kingdom. I think there are ", "some", " companies, very selective few, where they have an engine that is polished and ready to rev, and you\u2019re just giving gasoline to an engine that works really well.", "Like a Slack, for example. Slack, I mean.", "But there\u2019s very few of those.", "Right.", "Those are very rare, and so I don\u2019t think ... If SoftBank makes 50 investments, maybe five at most are those kind of companies. The disciplined companies that really get product-market fit without a lot of capital are almost surely gonna do better than the ones that chase hundreds of millions of dollars.", "So, how do you diffuse that in this ... How do you compete in this system when you\u2019re in this system, just in general?", "I think sometimes it takes time. It\u2019s hard. I mean, a lot of my job is really explaining things to entrepreneurs. I don\u2019t have any power. All I have is influence, and so I try to explain the trade-offs, and sometimes it just takes a cycle for people to see other people get burned by experience before things make sense to them, even if you can explain things rationally without the emotional context. ", "So, for example, we grew up in Silicon Valley that went through 2000 to 2002, so to us it\u2019s ...", "Right, and then 2008, right?", "Yeah.", "Yeah.", "But 2008 was a blip. It was very short.", "Right, but 2002 was ... Yeah.", "2000 to 2003 was like a ... It was called like a nuclear winter here, and almost everybody you met didn\u2019t have a job. They were out of work. I think those who went through that searing experience, and you can see it on Twitter, things that someone like Bill Gurley tweets... It just frames your perspective in a way that you realize not everything\u2019s always up and to the right, and that you need to have control of the leverage in your company and control of your destiny so when the world does change, you\u2019re not caught blindsided. But if you\u2019ve never been through that kind of experience ... I work with a lot of young entrepreneurs that are basically post-2008, and they\u2019ve been through ...", "Zero, right.", "... 10 years of uninterrupted growth, and this doesn\u2019t make any sense to them. When you talk about, \u201cWell, the world can change. Capital is not always gonna be free or very cheap.\u201d", "Like this week.", "Yeah, this week is gonna potentially shake things up, but I can see a little bit of nervousness on some entrepreneurial friends of mine\u2019s faces this week, the ones that are in town, and they\u2019re asking questions for the first time, the kind of questions that three years ago and five years ago they were completely ignoring. ", "So, I think the benefits of some experience are that you can see how the world shifts and that you can be prepared for it. But I think in total, the world of SoftBank goes through an evolution. I think it\u2019s gonna be very hard to teach, in quotes, people the downsides of taking SoftBank capital, which are many.", "Right, and we\u2019ll talk about other issues there in the next sections.", "Oh, there\u2019s lots of issues there.", "... around the Saudis and everything else. So, to finish our segment, what is the state of venture capital right now, as we\u2019re going into 2019? How would you describe it right now?", "Interestingly enough, I think in the last month or two it\u2019s really cooled down. I think you can see that certainly Series B and later level, a fair amount of hesitation on pulling the trigger on monster investments. At the seed level, it\u2019s not as obvious how much impact we\u2019ve seen in the last six to eight weeks. It\u2019s also a little difficult because venture capitalists canonically go on vacation in December, and it was very busy, a shockingly busy December, but I think that was the run on the bank sort of experience.", "Because? What do you mean?", "Everybody, I think, felt a little bit of unease, so every company that could and every founder that could and every VC that could was raising money ahead of the curve before 2019 started. So, typically, December slows down for investors and for companies because they\u2019re sort of derivative from the venture capitalist schedule. I felt like December was the busiest of my venture career by far, and I suspect ...", "In terms of investment or raising?", "Raising.", "Raising.", "Raising, and I think it was because people felt that the world could be changing and shifting, and they\u2019re all trying to fuel up with money as fast as possible so that they weren\u2019t caught last in the last chair standing kind of problem. ", "So, we\u2019ll see what happens in January when everybody comes back to work. Everybody\u2019s in the same place, but with the market turbulence, it\u2019s certainly gonna exacerbate and amplify some of those feelings, but whether it\u2019s a real correction or a temporary blip, I don\u2019t think anybody absolutely knows. ", "As Peter Thiel likes to say, the only thing he really knows is we\u2019re 10 years closer to the end of this bubble than we were, but that no one can predict the timing.", "So, when you look out at 2019, are you optimistic, pessimistic, or do you just gonna keep ...", "I\u2019m pessimistic at the later-stage version of Silicon Valley.", "We\u2019ll talk about IPOs also in the next section.", "I think there\u2019s going to be a ... There\u2019s already been a 30 percent correction of public market prices for technology stocks, which is a reasonable amount already, but I suspect there\u2019s a little bit more there. ", "I\u2019m very optimistic about the innovation in Silicon Valley, that the fundamental building blocks of technology are accelerating. The innovation at the root level is exciting. Every partner meeting on Monday, we typically have companies present, and because we invest early ...", "You see early trends.", "... we see the future, and the future is great on all kinds of dimensions. We see fascinating innovation every week, so I\u2019m incredibly optimistic, and these companies are gonna bake over the next three to five years, so what happens in January doesn\u2019t really matter to them.", "Doesn\u2019t matter, yeah.", "It\u2019s like having a baby, in a sense. It takes a couple years to grow up before you even know much about the child.", "That is true. I have children. Do you have children, Keith?", "Not yet.", "It takes a long time. Can you give me a five-minute idea of what that is? What do you mean? What is coming that you find so intriguing?", "Sure. So, a couple of areas. In healthcare, the use of data to improve outcomes is really starting to happen, where math actually does a very good job correcting for the errors and mistakes humans make. We\u2019re starting to see the FDA actually approve technologies and products that use math instead of humans, and that\u2019s encouraging a positive feedback loop where people are more willing to invest in companies that are gonna displace human judgment and make either access more affordable or more immediate.", "So, diagnostics, for example.", "Yeah. Diagnostics are a good example. The treatment\u2019s a little bit more tricky. We don\u2019t do biotech, per se. I mean, the actual drugs we wouldn\u2019t do. There is a nice trend of using software instead of pharma, which is interesting.", "To test things.", "Where you can produce the same outcome by using an application to retrain your brain in different ways, and the FDA\u2019s also blessed that. So actually, one of the benefits of the Trump administration, insofar as there are any... I think most people would find that the FDA\u2019s been much more both rigorous but also innovation-friendly.", "Yeah. I have heard that. Yeah. That\u2019s what a lot of people are telling me. Anne Wojcicki just said that.", "It\u2019s leading to positive outcomes. I mean, these are real people that need new treatments, and I think the FDA, the new FDA is very consciously aware that they have to ruthlessly enforce principles.", "For safety.", "But they also should look for new ways of doing things.", "Most people feel the FDA was way behind Europe or any other, which is unusual, we\u2019re being behind Europe in terms of regular ...", "Yeah. No, extremely unusual that a US agency is more heavy-handed and more intensively regulating than the equivalent in Europe. That was probably going on for a while, but it has been corrected in the Trump administration, so that\u2019s one of the best areas of the Trump administration, particularly vis-a-vis Silicon Valley.", "All right. So, healthcare. What else? What other areas for innovation?", "We\u2019ve had some investments in satellites and in rocket companies. One that\u2019s already sort of pretty public is Rocket Lab, which is producing very low-cost rockets that will put satellites into orbit quickly and regularly with the ...", "It\u2019s low-hanging satellites, right? I\u2019ve talked to ... Jerry Yang is also in a bunch of those.", "Yeah. This one\u2019s actually ... We\u2019ll put it into orbit for less than the cost of SpaceX, and the goal is to actually be putting rockets into space as frequently as we expect airlines to take off. I mean, if you think about when planes were invented, the idea that planes would be flying every hour everywhere was probably pretty crazy. There will be a point probably in your kid\u2019s lifetime where rockets are taking off just like we expect planes to take off, and that will change a lot of things.", "The cost of putting a satellite into orbit and the delay associated with putting a satellite in orbit handicaps and hampers innovation, and so when people realize that they\u2019ll be able to put a dedicated launch into orbit for less than $5 million, ", "and", " that they can bank on the predictability of putting that into orbit and replacing it, there\u2019s gonna be a lot of innovation that can be done in space. So, I think the Space Race is back. ", "I spent a little bit of time this year reading about Apollo 8. There\u2019s a great new book called ", "Rocket Man", ".

It depends a little bit, and we\u2019ll talk about this, these are the other policy issues. But it depends if your baseline is absolute perfection or your baseline is how many humans die every day.

So I absolutely really reject the idea that new technology should be perfect.", " ", "That\u2019s not the milestone. The milestone is, is it better than what we do every day?

Whenever I gave a speech two years ago and I said, \u201cSomeday owning a car is gonna be like owning a horse.\u201d You\u2019ll have it at your ranch and you\u2019ll drive it around, or you\u2019ll ...

The way I think about AI is maybe a little bit different, which is, I actually believe in AI and I believe there\u2019s a lot of innovation that\u2019s already happened and still accelerating.

Which is a rogue thing.", "So they use AI to draft their patent filings with some human labor.", "Yeah.", "But the customer is delighted because instead of going to a patent firm and paying an exorbitant cost to write a patent filing and waiting three to four weeks, we can do it in one to two weeks for a third of the cost.", "Mm-hmm.", "So you\u2019re gonna see a lot of stuff like that.", "Absolutely, absolutely.", "And then more people will be able to consume it.", "Lawyers, diagnostics, there\u2019s all kinds of things that are higher-level jobs that are ...

But there\u2019s jobs that allegedly entail human judgment that are a lot more like manufacturing than people realize. I mean, I was a lawyer. A lot of what lawyers do is a hell of a lot like working in a factory.", "Right.", "That\u2019s one of the reasons why I escaped.", "Right, right, exactly. All right, so we talked about innovation going on, but how do you assess this year? Let\u2019s talk about some of the ethical issues with Facebook and with Khashoggi and this investment by the Saudis. Do you think this group of people is equipped, with all these exciting things that are ahead, to deal with it? How do you assess sort of the ethical health of Silicon Valley right now?", "Well, I would also frame this very differently.", "Okay.", "Which is, compared to who and compared to what?", "All right. Okay, these are people who did go on and on about how good they are.", "Yeah, that\u2019s fair.", "This is a group of people ... Wall Street people never said, \u201cWe\u2019re not evil.\u201d", "No, but people do come to Silicon Valley with a mission.", "Right.", "And the mission is to improve some element of society that\u2019s probably broken or inaccessible.", " ", "And I think that\u2019s what\u2019s powered the best companies in the history of Silicon Valley forever. So I believe that that\u2019s true and that\u2019s the missionary zeal.", "Mm-hmm.", "Silicon Valley\u2019s become more important. It\u2019s a bit like the old Steve Jobs quote of the pirates and the Navy: \u201cEverybody roots for the pirates until they\u2019re successful, then you have to act like the Navy.\u201d And Silicon Valley has historically been the pirates, upending and improving archaic industries.", "Which is an old meme, let\u2019s be honest.", "Yeah. No, but it\u2019s actually quite relevant. I actually think I coined this, in terms of the change. I did an interview with Travis about five years ago.", "Kalanick.", "Yeah, onstage. And as he was talking, it occurred to me that basically what was happening was the technology companies were becoming so important that they were really more like the Navy.", "Mm-hmm.", "And when you\u2019re the Navy, you have to act like the Navy. You can\u2019t act like the pirate anymore. And then that transformation probably lagged a bit, especially at some companies like Uber, but maybe even across Silicon Valley. But to me, humans are humans, and they\u2019ve been humans ... If you read Shakespeare, there\u2019s nothing that\u2019s happening in Silicon Valley that you can\u2019t find in Shakespeare.", "No?", "Because humans have always been humans. Or, if you read Sapiens, you get a feel for this, too, going back not just centuries, but eons. And so to me, when you talk about an ethical debate, the question is, are we doing things better than we used to, better than other humans, better than 100 years ago, better than 1,000 years ago? And the answer to most of those questions is yes, yes, and yes.", "Mm-hmm.", "And so yes, people can improve. Yes, Silicon Valley can improve. But if you compare it on any benchmark and yardstick to humans in history, it\u2019s usually pretty damn good.", "Okay.", "So we can talk about this very specifically on any of these topics, but I don\u2019t start with the premise that Silicon Valley should be so bulletproof and so perfect, or it\u2019s fair to criticize Silicon Valley.", "Right. Okay, so what do you think of the criticism? It\u2019s mostly focused on Facebook, of course, as you know.", "Yeah, which I think, in some sense, is also a little unfair.", "Mm-hmm.", "I think some things Facebook has done are unique to Facebook, and that\u2019s a legitimate topic to discuss and criticize. I think a lot of things Facebook has done are actually things other technology companies or other non-technology companies have done, and the media\u2019s been fairly inconsistent in singling out Facebook.", "Sure.", "Let\u2019s take a classic example. People talk about using certain data to target ads on Facebook. And they can complain about, you can target on this way or that way, and they find nefarious examples of such, allegedly. I would posit that anything you\u2019ve seen on Facebook in terms of targeted ads can be done on steroids, i.e. more targeted with more data that\u2019s more personally sensitive, using direct mail. And direct mail\u2019s been around at least since the 1940s.", "Right, right.", "But I don\u2019t read that the New York Times is writing expos\u00e9s on direct mail.", "They have written stories on direct mail.", "They probably have, but then they drop it.", "Yeah. So why do you think this way? Is it the size of it? The massive impact, it\u2019s the numbers, I think, is probably why.", "I think it\u2019s jealousy, truthfully.", "Oh, interesting.", "I actually think a lot of journalists are jealous of tech. They have colleagues that are ... They have comparable people that went to school with them at Harvard, Yale, etc. that went into tech companies that are saying they age and make a lot more money.", "Oh, I\u2019m gonna push back on that. I have ... No.", "Secondly, the biggest issue is gatekeeping. It\u2019s the removal of the gatekeeper role. So when I was growing up, which isn\u2019t that long ago, the media had massive gatekeeping obligations and impact. So if CBS news didn\u2019t wanna cover your story, there really wasn\u2019t a way to communicate directly to the American people. Or, even when I started in Silicon Valley in 2000, basically if the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Fast Company, Wired, or maybe one or two other publications wouldn\u2019t write about you, there was nothing you could do. That\u2019s changed with a proliferation of Twitter, Reddit, Facebook. There\u2019s so many channels to communicate your ideas that the role of the media has been eviscerated. The media cannot stop ideas from spreading anymore, and I think that frustrates a lot of people in the media and they kinda wanna put the genie back in the bottle. And you see that in a lot of the coverage. It\u2019s either explicit or implicit. ", "Naval was the first one to ... Naval Ravikant was the first one to really point this out. In a blog post he wrote in 2012, I believe, he basically predicted this whole trend that the media would push back on the lack of gatekeeping that they\u2019ve historically performed.", "Well, lack of gatekeeping. What about, you\u2019ve gotta ... Keith, you can\u2019t utterly dismiss some of their sloppy management at Facebook. Over and over again, there\u2019s instances of not being gatekeepers being problematic.", "Yeah, that\u2019s fair. But compared to what? I mean, again, the printing ... As Tyler Cowen has written, I don\u2019t know any criticism of Facebook that wouldn\u2019t have been written about the printing press. When the printing press first was ...", "Which there was. There was, yes.", "Yes, but the printing press was obviously one of the most important things in the history of the human race. And it created revolutions. Before, religious sects could control the dissemination of ideas.", "Right. Yes, monks. I\u2019ve heard of it, right.", "And after the printing press, they couldn\u2019t. And so there were lots of new religions, so they created revolutions. And that\u2019s exactly what social platforms are doing. They\u2019re creating revolutions. But the printing press was clearly a ...", "Now, the printing press was available to lots of people. Facebook is run by one person, if you really ... Pretty much.", "Yeah, but they\u2019re ... If not Facebook, there\u2019s Twitter. And if not Twitter, there\u2019s Reddit.", "But Facebook, by far, is the biggest.", "I don\u2019t believe that, actually.", "All right, okay.", "I think Twitter has more impact on policy.", "Yeah. No, that\u2019s ... I wrote a column about that this week.", "Yeah. I actually don\u2019t think Facebook has nearly as much impact as people think. For example, Google\u2019s pretty influential. It\u2019s hard to live without Google. I don\u2019t find it hard to live without Facebook. It doesn\u2019t perform a utilitarian function for me. Twitter does perform a utilitarian function.", "For news, newspaper. Right.", "It\u2019s like my newspaper. It\u2019s like my New York Times.", "Right.", "When I was growing up, on Sundays I would sit at my table, have a bagel, and consume the New York Times.", "Right.", "Now I wake up in the morning, I don\u2019t have a bagel anymore, I have eggs instead. But I also read Twitter all morning, and then I click through other links that are interesting.", "Right. Including New York Times articles, yeah.", "So it\u2019s this ... Yeah, absolutely. It\u2019s a reasonable fraction of stuff I may click through. But fundamentally, my go-to constellation is Twitter.", "What would you criticize Facebook for?", "Well I think they ... So I think their communication strategy has been intellectually bankrupt.", "Mm-hmm.", "I think they\u2019ve been incredibly defensive. They should be framing some of these debates instead of waiting for the expos\u00e9 and then reacting to it. I think they\u2019ve struggled with whether they really want to embrace a censorship role or not, which is a complicated topic. I think, for example, if you take their mission seriously, which is to serve all humans and certainly all Americans, they really shouldn\u2019t be censoring content unless libelous, obscene, that\u2019s about it. Pornographic.", "Violent, violent. Promoting violence.", "Yeah, maybe directly inciting violence, which is the standard from the Supreme Court in 1969, but anything else, I don\u2019t think you can serve the needs ...", "And what about their performance around political advertising in the Russian ... Having it ...", "Well, let\u2019s talk about that. So there ", "are", " some laws that apply to the purchase of ads by foreign entities that have been the law of the United States for a while. And Facebook, like any other media, should observe those laws.", "Right.", "So if you can\u2019t buy a TV ad if you\u2019re a Russian entity, you shouldn\u2019t be allowed to buy an ad on Facebook. It should be consistent across channels. But if you can buy a TV ad, then you should absolutely be able to buy the same ad on Facebook.", "Sure, yep.", "So I think they were negligent in some of that. Now that said, a lot of the complaints ... Because the total expense ...", "Was around the content. I understand that advertising wasn\u2019t quite ...", "Yeah, the advertising was a small component.", "It\u2019s the use of it, it\u2019s the content, it\u2019s the distribution.", "But the content, if those people are allowed to publish a book in the United States, why can\u2019t they share the content on Facebook?", "It\u2019s amplified, it\u2019s problematic.", "Yeah, but ...", "I know, but I\u2019m just saying it puts them in the zero seed.", "Right, but if I publish a book, I can buy ads for the book. I can run an ad in the New York Times for my book.", "Yes.", "I can go on radio and talk about my book, I can do a book tour.", "But look at the difference. Say I ... It was interesting, this sort of pushback of Alice Walker at the New York Times, just even mentioning a book, and the New York Times responding, versus Facebook and being used by the ... Without explaining that these were Russians that are trying to influence the election. You know what I mean? There was ... Until lately, that wasn\u2019t the case.", "Well, I think that influencing elections is something every government in history has tried to do.", "Right, and this just is a great platform to do it.", "The American government on down.", "Yes, of course.", "So I think the biggest issue was the American government was not wary enough about the agenda of certain other countries. Russia, particularly. But also, you could argue, China. And the tech companies, in some ways, were following the lead of their government. I mean, Obama famously ridiculed Mitt Romney for calling out Russia as a potential threat.", "Right.", "And why Facebook should be more prescient than Obama about the threat of Russia, to me, makes no sense. I think Obama was wrong.", "Well, a bit more. Yes, absolutely. But they have a lot of information of what\u2019s moving on their system. Or maybe they don\u2019t.", "Well, presumably Obama had a lot of information, I hope.", "Probably Facebook and ...", "From the CIA and other people.", "Yes, yes, yes. And definitely, I think people within Facebook said ... We warned them. Certain people said we did warn them. Others say we didn\u2019t warn them enough. You know.", "Let me come back to the metaphor of a book, though.", "Okay.", "I think if you can publish a book in the United States, then you should be absolutely free to share that content on Facebook or Twitter.", "Even if you can hide who you are.", "Well, what are the rules around publishing a book? This country was founded on anonymous or pseudonymous pamphlets.", "With cool names, like Alexander Hamilton had...", "Well, some were true names, some were not.", "No, I know that. I know that. I was ...", "I mean, it\u2019s classic American history. This is the reason why we teach American history. It\u2019s not just for obscure facts, it\u2019s so that the debates and principles can apply to now, to today\u2019s world. I don\u2019t see why there should be a rule that says you have to publish under your own name.", "Mm-hmm.", "I think if you buy ads, there\u2019s a legitimate paradigm that\u2019s been established that only some people can buy ads.", "So does it worry you, as an American citizen, that this is allowed to happen?", "Not really. But here\u2019s why.", "Okay.", "So the one study I\u2019ve been waiting for someone to show me is a survey of some type \u2014 and you can debate the methodology; put aside the exact methodology for a second \u2014 that the voters in 2016, in some net way, were less informed.", "They will never be able to figure it out.", "Yeah. But there were ... I actually would argue that in 2016, the average voter knew more about society and life than in any time in American history. If you think about how much the average American knew in 1906 ...", "Yeah, so they had more information.", "Yeah. So show me a study, in some way that there was more confusion, more misrepresentation, more misunderstandings than any time in any other election. I actually think that\u2019s impossible to prove.", "Yeah.", "Because it\u2019s actually factually wrong.", "It\u2019s ... Well, perhaps.", "The average American was pretty manipulated by a lot of media.", "Mm-hmm.", "And actually wasn\u2019t that well educated. I mean, until the 1960s, \u201870s, \u201880s, even the idea of going to college was sort of the preserve of the elite. Now, everybody debates whether everybody should go to college for free.", "All right, so we have to finish this section, but what would you imagine will happen to Facebook now?", "Well, I think Facebook has generally played some of their political cards pretty well. They\u2019re pretty deft about using their connections through Peter.", "Mm-hmm, Peter Thiel, who\u2019s on the board.", "Peter on the board, they\u2019re pretty careful. They listen to Joel Kaplan, who\u2019s getting a lot of coverage. I think Google\u2019s a lot less careful about their perception in Washington. And there\u2019s an interesting problem that these tech companies, the major tech companies, particularly Facebook and Google, to some extent, Amazon may have ...", "And Twitter.", "Which is, the left wants to regulate tech companies.", "Yes, they do.", "Because the left doesn\u2019t like accumulated power.", "Right.", "Traditional left view. And the right, who should be the natural defender of not using the government and regulation to interfere in private businesses actually feels that these companies are monocultures of liberalism and doesn\u2019t really wanna lift a finger to defend these companies that are sort of left-wing institutions. So the tech companies have this fundamental problem, which is their natural ideological defenders don\u2019t really like the culture and the employee-based views and the contributions, the political contributions of these companies. So they\u2019re not very excited about defending from the left, the regulation.", "Yeah, they\u2019re not going to. Yeah.", "I mean, I talk to my friends all the time on the right, and they understand the views about why they should be opposed to what the left wants to do, but they have scarce time in their life and they have scarce political capital. They\u2019re like, \u201cWhy would I defend Google? Why would I use my capital for that?\u201d", "Do you feel like regulation is coming? Antitrust, correct?", "Well, antitrust is complicated because ...", "It\u2019s changing.", "Well, it may change. But the fundamental principle of consumer harm is pretty deeply embedded in antitrust philosophy in the United States, and it\u2019s very difficult, if not impossible, to show consumer harm, but these ...", "To prove customer harm. People love Amazon, right?", "Yeah. Well, they\u2019re free products.", "They\u2019re great.", "For the most part.", "They work.", "So it\u2019s hard to show raising prices and monopoly profits. Secondly, Amazon tends to have a fairly low price, but not below marginal cost, so it\u2019s been traditionally very difficult in the United States to show anti-consumer behavior when that\u2019s true.", "Same thing with Google and Facebook.", "Exactly.", "So what do you imagine the regulation ...", "I think the regulation, certainly out of Europe, will continue to increase because they have a different history of antitrust regulation where it\u2019s more of a policy and politics decision. Secondly, I think that until 2020, the administration is gonna be in the hands of mostly people who buy the Borkian view of antitrust policy, which is unique consumer harm. If Trump were to lose and the Democrats to win, then I think you could see a head of the FTC or head of the antitrust division that really tries to rewrite American antitrust doctrine.", "Yeah, and that\u2019s been talked about.", "Before that, yeah, you see occasional academic journals ... I mean, this is what I used to do for a living, I was a lawyer, I was an antitrust litigator. And the problem you have \u2014 and I\u2019ve thought about this a lot and debated it with some of my colleagues on the right \u2014 is coming up with a neutral principle. A principle that would apply to tech companies but that wouldn\u2019t completely undermine all of the antitrust history. And it\u2019s very difficult to find.", "It is.", "I can think of a few, but it\u2019s not easy at all. And at least if I were in government, I\u2019d want a neutral principle that I could defend as ... Would work for every industry.", "This is ", "what Makan Delrahim was talking about", " when I interviewed him, the same thing. ", "Yeah. No, absolutely. You need neutral principles. And if you don\u2019t have a neutral principle, I don\u2019t think you want to a start a process where you\u2019re just scapegoating people. That\u2019s kind of Nixonian, actually, in some ways. And I think that\u2019s a very bad precedent.", "So what do you expect? If you ... Probably ...", "I think you\u2019re gonna see a lot more hearings. So certainly the gavel, the fact that the Democrats have control of the gavel is ...", "So privacy.", "Some of the nuances of being the majority in the House is you can call hearings whenever you want.", "Right.", "Only the majority can schedule hearings, so I think you\u2019re gonna see Sundar onstage a lot more. And maybe Mark onstage and Sheryl onstage. ", "Any use to those things, or just ...", "Well, occasionally those things backfire. So when you\u2019re onstage, one misstatement can really create a firestorm.", "Right.", "And most of these tech leaders have not been under pressure like that. It\u2019s not like doing a journalist interview.", "Right.", "It\u2019s more like doing a TV interview.", "And you\u2019re under oath.", "And TV interviews are really difficult, as you ... When you interviewed Mark onstage, for example, years ago, it was very difficult for him.", "Yeah, he didn\u2019t do very well in the podcast, though, either.", "I think podcasts are easier than TV interviews, because it\u2019s your ... Nixon and the famous Kennedy-Nixon problem.", "Right, yeah.", "Argumentatively, American history was changed.", "Yeah, they don\u2019t like to be on TV anyway.", "So in any event, I suspect you\u2019re gonna see them onstage a lot. And that will cause someone to screw up, where they say something inappropriate, not ideally framed, that leads to an investigation, which may uncover some evidence. I think, for example, if you were to subpoena Facebook and Google, you would find documents that are not particularly exciting.", "Oh, yeah. My god, their emails have gotta be awful.", "They have to be awful.", "They have to be awful.", "Yeah. And they\u2019d be embarrassing.", "Even the small ones that\u2019ve come out, I\u2019m like, \u201cOh.\u201d", "Yeah, well, imagine ... You lived through the Microsoft litigation.", "Mm-hmm, oh yeah, that\u2019s exactly right. That\u2019s ", "exactly", " where they\u2019re gonna get them, with the emails. Because they\u2019re so careless and also on their ... They all have these internal message boards.", "It\u2019s impossible to police those perfectly.", "Right.", "As someone who used to run companies, you can try to remind people that one day someone may look at this out of context and, \u201cPlease be careful what you write,\u201d but you need people to do their jobs too, which is to communicate directly, succinctly, powerfully, off the cuff, on the fly.", "Oh no, Slack and the message boards alone ...", "Slack, message boards, this stuff\u2019s gonna be very embarrassing. So the question is what\u2019s the legal doctrine and legal hook that allows someone to subpoena this evidence and get their hands on this treasure trove? Once they have the treasure trove, all hell\u2019s gonna break loose because it\u2019s gonna be very embarrassing.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s gonna be emails, it\u2019s Slack.", "You have Slack, what people think of is instantaneous. The more instantaneous something is, the less they edit.", "Right, text, oh God. There\u2019s just so much.", "It\u2019s gonna be really ... Facebook Messenger.", "So let\u2019s move on really quickly to \u2014 Messenger, absolutely \u2014 Khashoggi. You and I share the same opinion about this in terms of ... So talk about that.", "Yes. Well, to me it wasn\u2019t surprising. Saudi Arabia has been ...", "A big investor via SoftBank and others.", "Saudi Arabia has discriminated against gays, women, Jews, officially, explicitly, for decades. It executes people who are gay. It executes people who are Jewish. So the idea that they would murder someone isn\u2019t surprising to me. To me, it\u2019s surprising that more people weren\u2019t paying attention to the evils of Saudi Arabia for the last 30 years. Now there\u2019s a reason why they\u2019ve been politically helpful with some other battles that the United States has had in the Middle East, so it\u2019s a marriage of convenience. But that doesn\u2019t mean that Silicon Valley should be participating in this. ", "We talked on your show, your podcast, two-and-a-half years ago \u2014 maybe three years ago, actually \u2014 that people boycotting Silicon Valley \u2014 North Carolina or Georgia \u2014 for somewhat mundane legal changes, whether it\u2019s the bathroom labeling or something equivalent, yet they take money from Saudi Arabia, where it\u2019s illegal to be gay. It\u2019s illegal, like a crime. It\u2019s not just like you can\u2019t go to the bathroom that you choose, it\u2019s like \u201cWe\u2019re gonna shoot you.\u201d Or if you\u2019re Jewish, you could be discriminated against in any possible amount of ways. So I think people are incredibly hypocritical here.", "I am with you on this. So what will happen? Will they keep taking the money?", "Over time, probably not. In the short term, yes, because especially as the economy gets softer in Silicon Valley, the desperation for money among late-stage companies is gonna be higher. But a lot of entrepreneurs are definitely having these debates. And some have been hesitant. I know some entrepreneurs who could have taken SoftBank money that have decided ...", "SoftBank, half of its fund is from Saudi Arabia, just to be clear.", "It\u2019s more than half, it\u2019s more like 90 percent. It\u2019s half if you allow them to do accounting gimmicks.", "It\u2019s a lot.", "It\u2019s 80-90 percent if you don\u2019t.", "It\u2019s the big funder.", "There is no Vision Fund without Saudi Arabia.", "Is there any clean money? I mean, where it comes from. They were stack ranking at a party I was at recently which is why ...", "Yeah, I know, that\u2019s true. You do have this issue of late-stage money rate. A lot of money comes from Russia, which is no longer acceptable. You have money coming from Saudi Arabia, which, at least to me, should be unacceptable. And you have money from China, which has its own set of issues in that actually the money from China may not be coming for other reasons internal to China anyway. So yeah, you can get money from T. Rowe Price or Lee Fixel or Fidelity.", "And where do they get the money from?", "They get the money from more traditional sources. Doesn\u2019t mean that all Americans are good or all American money is clean, but fundamentally, if you\u2019re taking money from an investor that trying to effectively launder the money, which is what a lot of countries have been doing, and that\u2019s been propping up some of these late-stage financings. ", "To me, I think that means you go public, and if you go public you take money from normal, everyday Americans. You have the disclosure obligations and the serious scrutiny and accounting requirements that is associated with taking money from normal Americans, but that degree of disclosure and credibility and scrutiny and transparency is actually a good thing. I think it\u2019s a good thing for your company, actually, to be subject to auditors and subject to reporting.", "And where you\u2019re getting the money from.", "Well, not just where you\u2019re getting the money from but how you\u2019re performing.", "Right, exactly.", "I think people are trying to insulate themselves from accountability. ", "Well that\u2019s true. That\u2019s 100 percent true. Right, I\u2019m gonna ask some ... I asked a question of what I should ask you on Twitter and of course Antonio \u2014 he\u2019s such a pain in the ass \u2014 Antonio Garcia Martinez, who was also very argumentative person on Twitter, and I enjoy him doing that, \u201cI think we want a video of the probable fistfight.\u201d We don\u2019t fistfight. The gays don\u2019t fistfight, Antonio.", "No. Fistfight, that\u2019s so archaic.", "So here\u2019s one from Jason Del Rey, actually: \u201cWhat\u2019s the definition of contrarian in 2019?\u201d Because you\u2019re known as a contrarian.", "Well, I like to think from first principles and I like to think for myself, which means occasionally I align with you and occasionally I don\u2019t. I like to be a non-derivative thinker. It\u2019s not always possible. Everybody lives in concentric circles \u2014 your professional circles, your social circles \u2014 and that obviously influences you.", "Right.", "But I try to have my own perspective. I like to read, for example, in my free time, I read books.", "What?", "And occasionally it changes my thinking. Yeah, I read old-school books. That\u2019s what I was doing yesterday: Most of yesterday, being Jewish, was not celebrating a holiday, I was reading, I read like three books yesterday. ", "Which ones?", "So I read this really great book on cancer innovation called ", "Breakthrough", ", which is incredibly impressive in terms of its ability to tell the story of how using your own immune system to fight cancer is better than radiology or chemotherapy. But it had been suppressed by the medical community for a century.", "Wow.", "So this has been known since the 1890s that you can, at least in some kinds of cancer, use your own immune system to fight cancer. But a lot of medical people and experts didn\u2019t believe this, and so they actively suppressed this knowledge. And people were dying as they were suppressing this knowledge. ", "It\u2019s now becoming more mainstream cause there\u2019s now enough data to overcome all the suppression but it reminds you that even \u201cscience and medicine\u201d isn\u2019t immune from political fights. And these political fights cost many people their lives because we spent a century not innovating on how to use your immune system to \u201ccure\u201d cancer. ", "Second one was Mike Ovitz\u2019s autobiography, which I highly recommend. It\u2019s a great tale in many ways.", "Why is that? Why do you like it?", "So, the thing I liked is, first of all, it\u2019s very candid. It\u2019s intellectually honest, it\u2019s personally honest. I\u2019m kind of an amateur observer of Hollywood and I found it fascinating, how fine the line is between success and failure. How many of these famous movies that won Academy Awards or that I grew up watching and were culture icons were ", "just", " barely made. Like, how much heroic effort went into packaging them and making them happen, and that the world could be completely different without a couple of very clever maneuvers. And so sometimes you take this success and work some technology just the same way.", "That\u2019s a really good point.", "You take these successful companies and assume that of course this was gonna succeed. But behind the scenes there was a hell of a lot of work and exploration and tenacity that went into these things.", "Oh, especially by him. He was a knuckle-breaker, right?", "Yeah.", "He\u2019s not well-liked in Hollywood because of that. All right, I\u2019m gonna ask another ... What\u2019s the third one?", "So the third one is this new one-volume biography of Churchill. So, I\u2019ve read Churchill biographies before. This may be the best one-volume. I mean obviously, if you really wanna read about Churchill you have to read more than one volume because his history, his life was full of so many ...", "Who\u2019s that by? He was ... Twists and turns ...", "So many dimensions, yeah. But this is a very good one.", "Who\u2019s it by?", "Oh man, I\u2019m spacing on the author\u2019s name. It was just published.", "Okay.", "It\u2019s doing very well. It\u2019s selling quite well, which is pretty impressive in its own right because it\u2019s still  \u2014 one volume means 900 pages, you know, in Churchill.", "Right.", "But I really enjoy it so far. I\u2019m only about 100 pages in.", "Speaking of contrarians ...", "Yes. I mean Churchill changed parties three times, he changed his views on several topics, but on the biggest issues and the biggest moments of his life, he was right.", "He was right, okay. So this is another question now. There\u2019s a lot around your politics, because Keith is conservative. Would you call yourself a conservative?", "Yeah, I consider myself conservative more than I consider myself a Republican.", "Okay, all right. What does that mean?", "To me, conservative means there\u2019s right and wrong and that there\u2019s a meritocratic benchmark that one can use to look at ideas.", "Okay, now this is a question: \u201cDo you feel loyalty to the USA when so many Libertarians are so anti-government and seemingly pro-Russia?\u201d Okay. And then there\u2019s another one about your friendship with Peter Thiel, who was obviously controversial because of his links with Donald Trump. \u201cDoes he think that Thiel is implicated in Cambridge Analytica scandal and will be interviewed by Mueller, go to federal prison, be deported to Germany?\u201d", "Twitter\u2019s up to its usual nonsense.", "He does have \u2026 That\u2019s all right.", "I mean, Cambridge Analytica is pretty funny.", "Away from Cambridge Analytica, what about your status as a conservative? How do you ...", "Well, I think it\u2019s hard to be conservative sometimes, not just in Silicon Valley, because it frustrates me often when conservatives don\u2019t do the hard work of coming up with innovative solutions to real problems. Being conservative doesn\u2019t mean not having a solution, it means having a different solution, often one that\u2019s not based upon government intervention. ", "So for example, in healthcare. The US government solution to healthcare is very counterproductive in many ways, but it doesn\u2019t excuse conservatives from having better answers. But it sometimes frustrates me that when we\u2019re out of power, that we weren\u2019t developing better answers to a lot of these problems. So I get annoyed once in a while.", "Every like 10 years, you see an up-and-coming conservative who has some fresh perspective and ideas and it\u2019s invigorating. Sometimes they do well in the political world, sometimes they get elected, sometimes they get elected and they disappoint you because they\u2019re like any other politician. So it\u2019s like a sine wave of emotions, being a conservative, because you get optimistic about somebody or something.", "Who were you optimistic about? Are you optimistic about Trump? Right now?", "Oh hell no, I think I called him a sociopath.", "Yeah. So you\u2019re not a Republican as the current Republican Party stands.", "And I also believe, I think I was the first person perhaps who funded Never Trump.", "Right.", "If you do some research you\u2019ll see that. So no, not the biggest fan.", "Do you debate with Peter about that?", "Yeah, a little bit. So Peter\u2019s view on Trump ...", "He was interested in lack of regulation, like the FDA getting ...", "Well, I think some of that area is very much ... Trump\u2019s been actually good at some of that. I think Peter\u2019s view on Trump is pretty simple to describe, which is, if you believe the US was on the wrong trajectory and wrong course, and it was gonna get worse, not better, the idea of rolling the dice with some random person might be better than staying the course.", "So, insert a disease.", "Yeah, it was a little bit like roll the dice, anything could be better. And you know, to some extent, that\u2019s what Trump\u2019s actually done. On some policies, for example, I believe his policy on China is actually probably more right than wrong. And I think that actually it\u2019s about 50-50 perspective on this in Silicon Valley at the moment. There\u2019s a lot of people who are very liberal who are actually applauding him for challenging China. So I think on some policies he\u2019s been willing to take a perspective.", "You know what, sometimes his directionally \u2026 absolutely, topically wrong, directionally correct about China but every single thing he says about it is the wrong way.", "Well, part of it is I think he has instincts but doesn\u2019t do the work. ", "I think many of them are racist or ill-informed or something, but usually these opinions are not based in any kind of research whatsoever, it\u2019s just off the top of his fucking head.", "Yeah, but his instincts sometimes are right. The foreign policy establishment, for example, can be wrong about a lot of things in the US.", "Certainly.", "And his willingness to challenge them and not just take for granted what they say ... So, for example, one of the things I applaud him a lot on is moving our embassy in Israel. Very controversial, everybody who\u2019s running for President for 40 years declared that they would do it, and every single one, whether they were Republican or Democrat, wimped out. So it was in the Democrat platform to move the embassy to Jerusalem, it was in the Republican platform since 1980 to move it. But every time someone became President they found every excuse under the book to not move it. He actually promised it and he actually did it. ", "And it turns out he was right. There weren\u2019t riots, it actually was supporting our ally, who is democratic. People in Israel, by the way, I was in Tel Aviv in August, they love Trump. Even the liberal part of the Israeli population love Trump because they finally found an American President who actually did what he said.", "Did the one thing that he said.", "He did one thing, one thing he promised.", "But you called him a sociopath, what do you imagine is gonna happen right now?", "That is a great question. I think he\u2019s running to a box where the people who are most talented really don\u2019t wanna work for him. And that\u2019s a fatal problem with a company ... We deal with this sort of board all the time: We have a CEO who has some talent but it is destructive and all of a sudden that company can\u2019t recruit talented designers, engineers, etc. And the company itself is in jeopardy because of that. I think he has now burned through so much of his administration ... ", "These are people he hired, by the way. One of the points that\u2019s hard to be forgiving to him \u2014 and people should really be attacking him on \u2014 is all these people he\u2019s fired for alleged flaws. He hired them all. So someone made the mistake on the way in. If you inherit someone as a CEO, it\u2019s perfectly fine to fire them when you realize they\u2019re not capable of doing the job. But if you\u2019re the one who hired them, too, you can\u2019t be hiring and firing people all day long.", "And there\u2019s a lot of them.", "It shows you don\u2019t know how to hire.", "Right, exactly. So where do you imagine this going?", "I think he holds on, and barring a health issue which \u2014 he is 72 years old and under stress all the time and doesn\u2019t have all the healthiest habits \u2014 I suspect that he runs for re-election. And if he runs for re-election, I think the odds of him winning are actually more than 50 percent. And the reason why is, obviously his favorable/unfavorable rating is poor, it\u2019s one of the worst in American history. But most of the Democrats who are gonna challenge him are very flawed themselves.", "It\u2019s been organizational...", "So abstractly, you can say, \u201cOh I can beat Trump,\u201d but when there\u2019s a very tangible, concrete person who has their own character flaws, that\u2019s gonna be very interesting.", "It\u2019ll be an interesting organizational challenge for the Democrats, because they managed to pull it off in the midterms, they managed to pull it off in places like Alabama...", "But they didn\u2019t have to nominate ", "one", " person for the midterms.", "Right, I know. But in Alabama, for example, there were lots of different places where they\u2019ve won in ...", "Some of that was self-inflicted Republican stupidity.", "Yes, but self-inflicted is the description of Trump, isn\u2019t it?", "Alabama particularly. Oh no, he commits ... The way I describe Trump is he commits the most unforced errors of anybody I\u2019ve ever seen. He finds a way to put defeat in the place of victory. He attacks his own supporters. Democrats ... In some ways, liberals are very lucky because you could have someone with Trump\u2019s views but without his personal character flaws. And that person, if he or she were elected President, would be phenomenally successful. Trump gets in his own way and probably is accomplishing one-third of what he probably could have accomplished.", "Same time, it was interesting when I was talking about today, when I was talking about my piece on how he uses Twitter as a government style, they were like, \u201cWell the next President will use it.\u201d Can anyone use it as well? That\u2019s a question of someone who can actually employ it. He employs it really well, not well, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s well, but it\u2019s kinda sociopathic, but it works for him.", "It\u2019s inconsistent, so I think he uses it brilliantly sometimes and it backfires on him sometimes. ", "But in general, I\u2019m saying I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s another candidate who can use it, it can\u2019t be just all of a sudden everyone\u2019s gonna use it well, because everyone can\u2019t. ", "No, I agree with that. People either, we have these waves, I alluded to the famous Nixon-Kennedy debate where many historians think Nixon lost the election, which was the first Presidential debate televised. Every new technology platform will empower a different type of person. Franklin Roosevelt famously used the radio. Trump is the first Twitter President. There will be a new platform at some point. A different way of sharing information and debating things.", "VR? What\u2019s it gonna be?", "The person who runs for President and uses that platform natively will probably do very well.", "What is it gonna be? VR? AR?", "I don\u2019t believe in VR, personally. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a thing other than maybe gaming. AR possibly but there\u2019ll be some new channel and some political candidate will pioneer how to use it. ", "There\u2019s a great book, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve read Neil Postman\u2019s book, ", "Amusing Ourselves to Death", ", from 1984. I think it perfectly predicted the Trump administration. But the main point of the book and the main arc of the book is that every medium of communication creates a different type of content that succeeds in that medium of communication.", "Absolutely.", "And Twitter is ideally suited for someone like Trump. There\u2019ll be a new platform at some point and there\u2019ll be a different candidate that takes advantage of that.", "Who\u2019s the best Democratic candidate to run against him? Off the top of your head. And for Silicon Valley, who\u2019s the best?", "The one who would give him the most trouble is Michelle Obama. I don\u2019t think she wants to run, but she would cause him real problems. Most of the other candidates won\u2019t. There\u2019s a couple of things that are implicit in Trump that don\u2019t get enough attention. One is he received a reasonable fraction of the African-American votes for a Republican. And the Democrats cannot win the President\u2019s seat if he gets double-digit African-American votes. ", "So the basic swing between Obama and Hillary summed up a lot. There\u2019s a lot of complexity. You can talk about anything you want, but fundamentally, it was that he got more African-American voters than she did. Obama got more than she did. And so someone who naturally appeals to the African-American community will do very well and cause him problems. ", "Secondly, someone who doesn\u2019t need the media attention, but will get it. Meaning someone who\u2019s above a certain status.", "I get it, Michelle and Oprah.", "Oprah could, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m more nervous, I mean, Howard Schulz and people like that are probably gonna run. But I think those people who\u2019ve never been tested tend to backfire a lot. It\u2019s very difficult when you\u2019re not used to this level of scrutiny and stress. Meg Whitman, for example, was a horrific political candidate. All of her races, all of the things she\u2019s done in politics, have backfired.", "She\u2019s uncomfortable.", "It\u2019s just a different skill. Trump you could tell had some skill in marketing from the day he announced his candidacy, when he came down the escalator. I remember sitting at home, it was a Sunday morning and I was watching it here with the guy I was dating at the time and he looked at me and he said, \u201cThis guy\u2019s gonna do well.\u201d And I was like, \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Cause it\u2019s Trump and I grew up in New York City, Trump in the \u201980s. ", "And he said, \u201cYou have to watch his speech.\u201d And I watched it and I was like, \u201cYou\u2019re right, he\u2019s definitely got a way of appealing to people and framing things that make people nod their head.\u201d And if you have that you can go far in politics, but that\u2019s a skill that most CEOs don\u2019t have.", "Nope, you\u2019re 100 percent right. I said the same thing when I was watching him, and I believe I\u2019m the only person who watched the entire seasons of \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d of the people we know.", "Oh God, I feel bad for you.", "Oh no! I loved it, I\u2019m just saying that ... the gays knew, the gays knew.", "Well I used to listen to him on the New York talk shows when I was growing up and one of the things I\u2019d do in high school and junior high school was we\u2019d listen to talk shows on the radio. It was kind of a common way to entertain ourselves, sports radio and other talk shows. And he\u2019d call in all the time. He was a very significant celebrity.", "Presence. ", "All right, we have to finish up. We didn\u2019t get to talk about Opendoor, but very briefly, where is it headed?

During World War II, people started using ball bearings instead of brass, because they roll around and reduce the points of contact between the moving parts. World War II is also when construction started using welding instead of rivets. But this machine is from 1939, before World War II.

It\u2019s at the peak of the arc and it is likely to happen. I think that\u2019s great and I welcome all the new voices and players at the table.

When I say the difference is the differentiation the different companies are trying to make among themselves on how they treat consumer data in a respectful way versus not, or versus the perceived not.

I am, again, short-term, a little pessimistic, but long-term, optimistic that there\u2019ll be enough public pressure, and thanks to good journalism and good writing about it, enough public pressure from civil society, and ultimately government action to constrain some of the worst uses.", "All right.

Wasser charges her normal clients $850/hour for her services, but those who can\u2019t afford that rate can check out the online divorce company she has started, It\u2019s Over Easy.", "\u201cPeople are shopping online,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are dating online. People are banking online. Why wouldn\u2019t they want to get divorced online?\u201d", "Currently, It\u2019s Over Easy only operates fully in New York and California, where she said 18 to 20 percent of the nation\u2019s divorces happen. Wasser hopes to be in all 50 states by the end of the year, but conceded it may not make business sense to invest in smaller states like Rhode Island.", "In addition to providing users with the necessary forms to get legally divorced in their state, she said It\u2019s Over Easy will provide other services to separating couples, relating to moving on and continuing to take care of their children.", "\u201cYou\u2019re going to be dealing with that person, particularly if you have kids, for a long time. So there are certain things that we could add to this,\u201d Wasser said. \u201cRight now, we have a co-parenting calendar. ... Let\u2019s put it all in one place, do it all in an app. Get the nanny looped in if she needs to be looped in.

", "Today in the red chair is Laura Wasser, a very famous divorce attorney who has become unusually famous for someone in her line of work. That\u2019s because she\u2019s worked with some of the biggest Hollywood stars in their divorces. We can talk about that in a minute. Laura, welcome to ", "Recode Decode", ".", "Laura Wasser: ", "Thank you for having me.", "I know it seems unusual that I might have a divorce attorney \u2014 I\u2019m not looking to divorce, I have been divorced \u2014 on my show. But you were moving into tech space, correct?", "Slowly.", "Slowly.", "Crawling, yes.", "Crawling.", "As us over-50s are wont to do, into the tech world.", "The legal profession has been slow, too.", "We have been very slow.", "Besides using various documents, stuff and things like that. We\u2019re going to talk about that and more with Laura. Give me your background. Give your background. You started where? How did you get into this line of work?", "I started here. I\u2019m from Southern California. My dad is a family law attorney. Although, if you had asked me when I was a teenager, \u201cDo you think you\u2019ll ever be A) a lawyer, B) a family law attorney?\u201d I would have just said, \u201cOh, god. Never, never, never, never.\u201d I actually got divorced after about 14 months of marriage when I was 25. I was waiting for my bar results and I needed the dough. I went to my dad. I said, \u201cCan I clerk for your firm while I\u2019m waiting for my bar results?\u201d and I never left. ", "It\u2019s actually a fascinating field of law. You really get to know about somebody, about human nature, about how somebody is. When you do it in this industry, the entertainment industry, you get to learn about a lot of people that you never would have any occasion to meet. Stevie Wonder\u2019s someone I call a close friend. Whether it\u2019s political, whether it\u2019s financial, whether it\u2019s entertainment-based, you really delve into these people\u2019s lives for about six to 12 months, and then you\u2019re out. It\u2019s super cool. ", "I found a niche and I liked it. I\u2019ve done it for about 25 years. At the beginning of last year, I realized ... or, before that, I realized ... Last year, we launched It\u2019s Over Easy, which is an online divorce site, which I am hoping will change not only the way people go through their divorces but how we approach divorce itself.", "Let\u2019s talk about how we approached it previously. Talk about that a little bit, about what the ...", "Crappily. ", "Crappily, okay.", "It\u2019s one of these ...", "Is that a ...", "Is that a word?", "It\u2019s an adverb, but go ahead. Crappily.", "Poorly. ", "Craptastic.", "The way that we look at it is this horrible taboo, failure, miserable. Look, it\u2019s not fun and it\u2019s not easy, as I say, even though the company\u2019s called It\u2019s Over Easy. What it is is something that\u2019s happened to about half of the people we know who are married, in which case we kind of have to accept that it is happening. ", "How can we do it better for ourselves and most particularly for our kids? Looking at it in a way as, \u201cHey, this was a time period of my life. I was romantically and intimately involved with this person. I got to know him or her very well. We had children. Now what do we do to not necessarily be sleeping in the same bed every night but to continue being partners as co-parents, perhaps with some of our financial issues as well?\u201d", "The reason it\u2019s done so well is because it\u2019s done in a way that\u2019s so analog. It\u2019s lugubrious and slow and takes years. Talk a little bit about that.", "Again, this is a system that is broken. It\u2019s broken in the legal system. When I was turning 50 and I was looking at my career and how it had gone and really having enjoyed it, I thought, \u201cYou have two choices: you go legislature or you go to some kind of tech app that can hopefully fix it.\u201d The first way seemed also rather slow.", "Talk about how long does it take to get divorced? Getting my divorce was ridiculous, and we had no problems. It was a ridiculously long time.", "California, which is where you guys got divorced, it takes six months. We have a six-month waiting period. Even if you walk in, file the paperwork, and say, \u201cThis is our deal. It\u2019s done,\u201d you still have to wait six months before a judicial officer will stamp it and it\u2019ll be done. I often tell clients and users of It\u2019s Over Easy, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about that. Get it done. Unless you\u2019re planning to marry somebody else so quick, in your mind, you\u2019re done and you\u2019ve gotten it done.\u201d ", "Other states are much quicker. New York State is 30 days from the day that you sign the final papers. As we\u2019ve all heard, Nevada\u2019s super quick. What I want it to be more about is what the parties have decided that they want to do. There has to be an exchange of information that makes sense. The forms are super complicated. We\u2019ve tried to make them less complicated. If you use a mediator or somebody that\u2019s doing collaborative divorce, somebody that can help you get through it and explain what all of these very complicated forms basically mean, the bottom line is, it\u2019s not that difficult. What people have to remember is that family law attorneys make money from conflict.", "That\u2019s right. ", "I say that to people all the time. \u201cGuys, I make more money if you can\u2019t agree who has Wednesday nights. If you can agree on who has Wednesday nights, come to me. I\u2019ll write it up. It\u2019s not going to cost a lot of money. Or better yet, write it up yourselves. I\u2019ll show you where to put it on the form. Submit it to the court. Done.\u201d ", "One of the ways that it had been done with innovations in legal was mostly just, \u201cHere are forms,\u201d and it\u2019s still incomprehensible. You get, \u201cHere are the easy forms for a contract. Here\u2019s the easy forms for a lease.\u201d Divorce, it\u2019d be something nobody would think of doing in an online space.", "I think people have thought of doing it, but it\u2019s been too difficult. There is also that human touch aspect. Most people want to know that there\u2019s somebody on the other end of the phone line, computer pad, whatever it is. That doesn\u2019t mean that they necessarily want to pay to valet park and come up to a consultation in my office for $800 or $900 per hour. There has to be a happy medium. When we came up with It\u2019s Over Easy, rather than just being a form provider, we also have a whole education site with people that write blogs and contribute and talk about things that have happened to them and professionals that do financial planning or co-parenting planning, all that kind of stuff. You can actually get a little educated about it. ", "Then we have people on the other end that can talk you through it if you need some help. We don\u2019t give legal advice, but we can say, \u201cThis is what this form means. Here\u2019s what date of separation means in your state.\u201d All kinds of pop-ups of me talking, YouTube video ask-style explaining things. Then we also have a third component to the site, which is a referral directory called The Index. The other thing that I have found doing this is it doesn\u2019t end when you\u2019re divorced and I signed my thing saying, \u201cBye-bye. Thanks for the money.\u201d They need people to help them with nannying. They need people to help them with moving. They need people with helping them ...", "Related.", "... figuring out their budget. Then they need people to help them get back into the dating world again.", "Oh, you have dating things? ", "We provide all of that.", "Walk someone through using your site for a divorce. Again, this is not something people think of as a digital area.", "I think they are thinking of it more, though. We have a partnership with LegalZoom. People go on LegalZoom in New York and California right now and they just are automatically redirected.", "Explain what LegalZoom is for ...", "LegalZoom is a site that is the biggest, I think, tech law site. If you need a will, you can go on. It provides templates. You fill it in, you submit it. Employment contracts, LLCs. It has been very difficult for them to get into the family law world, because, as you said, it is really complicated. There does need to be a little bit more of an educational element to it. So, we gave that. Like I say all the time, people are shopping online. People are dating online. People are banking online. Why wouldn\u2019t they want to get divorced online? You come on our site, and we don\u2019t make you sign up or pay us right away.", "What do you do? You get on the site ... explain the walkthrough.", "You get on the site and you play around a little bit. You want to read about a blog, you want to read about somebody that had ...", "Like what? What would you have on?", "There\u2019s one that I wrote. Content. One of the things I wrote is \u201cCo-Parenting With an Asshole,\u201d basically. Because people, even whether they\u2019ve already ...", "Asshole is a good topic.", "Whether they\u2019ve been divorced or not, if somebody\u2019s not doing things the way ", "you", " do them, then it doesn\u2019t seem right to you. I find that happens especially with us moms. We want to do it the way we want to do it, we want to control it. Then we want to complain about the fact that they\u2019re not doing it the right way. They don\u2019t drink their milk at his house. They don\u2019t brush their teeth at his house. Okay, but they\u2019re still having a relationship with their other parent. That\u2019s probably more important. There\u2019s a blog about that.", "Then I\u2019ve got people that are financial wizards who have said ... I said, \u201cDumb it down for normal people. They\u2019re not going to pay your all-day rate. Write me an article about what you should be doing to prepare for getting divorced. What you should be putting aside, what you should be thinking about, how much you should be spending, etc.\u201d Anyway, they can read about it. They get familiar. They want to do it. Fine, whatever. Then they will fill out their petition, which is the first step. They invite their partner to join. This really is a mediation site.", "Wait, you invite ... like, \u201cCome divorce with me\u201d?", "Yes. My guess is they probably already knew things weren\u2019t going well and had decided to get divorced. I have people call my office at my firm all the time and say, \u201cLook. I love you, but you\u2019re too expensive for my assistant or my sister or my whoever. Do you have ...\u201d", "May I ask what you charge? What is a typical high-level divorce lawyer? I mean, not the Angelina Jolie price.", "No, everybody has the same price. Everybody has the same price. It\u2019s an hourly rate. I believe that for the past seven years, I\u2019ve been $850 an hour, and I was told by my partners that they really think I need to up it to $900. I think, \u201cGod, I hope I say something that\u2019s really fucking smart for $900 an hour.\u201d", "$900 an hour. You\u2019re trying to destroy this fantastic business you ...", "I\u2019m not trying to destroy it. There will always be a need for people who can handle complex litigation, complicated if there\u2019s a move-away case. You can\u2019t just work that out.", "Rich people are different than you and I.", "No, no, no. In fact, they\u2019re ...", "You\u2019re a rich person. Wait a minute. ", "What it is is, again, if you have more money, more problems. If you have more assets, if you have a very complicated income stream of companies or commingling assets or even child custody stuff, it\u2019s not easy to figure out what\u2019s going to happen if you\u2019ve got two kids in California and the other parent wants to live in New York. You can\u2019t just split the baby, so to speak. Those are going to be complicated. ", "To the extent that people ", "can", " figure it out themselves, they should. I\u2019m not worried about continuing the legacy of this family law firm. We\u2019re going to be fine. I do believe that the majority of people, rich and poor ...", "A lot of what happens in digital is people taking advantage of getting rid of the friction that was always there, whether it\u2019s music or anything else.", "Like you discovered when you guys went through mediation, if you have to come to the table and solve your problems on your own ... which, in divorce, you\u2019re best-equipped to do. You know your kids better than any judge is going to know them. You know your finances better or you will get to know your finances better. Sit down with a legal pad, figure it out, plug it into the site, move on.", "You can read about a variety of topics, and then what happens?", "Then you can actually download ...", "You invite your ex-partner to join.", "Then you will exchange the information, which in all states is absolutely mandatory. You must disclose. You have declarations of disclosure. \u201cHere\u2019s what I have or what we have. Here\u2019s what I owe or what we owe. Here\u2019s what I make, and here\u2019s what I spend, or we.\u201d There\u2019s four corners of it. That has to happen in any divorce. You have to exchange that information. ", "Long-term marriages, it\u2019s all the same. You\u2019ve been married this long, you have this much money, you have this many assets, you owe this much to the bank. Here\u2019s what we make. Here\u2019s what we spend. You exchange that information. You come to terms with it. Some person says, \u201cNo, there\u2019s no way that that house is your house. We got that house together.\u201d \u201cNo, we got that house when I was about to marry you, but we hadn\u2019t married.\u201d You hash that out.", "On the site. All digital.", "All digital. I mean, you could be in person and do it together, but you can literally do it when one person\u2019s here and another person\u2019s in Dubai. I don\u2019t care.", "Taking notes on it.", "Exactly. You can flag if you didn\u2019t get the same answers, and then you can talk to ...", "\u201dIf one person\u2019s in Dubai,\u201d did you just say that?", "Well, yeah.", "Why Dubai?", "I don\u2019t know. I picked a really far place that I\u2019ve never been to before.", "How about New Jersey?", "Or New Jersey. Or incarcerated. We have some of those, which is good. It\u2019s hard to get together with a mediator if they\u2019re in prison. ", "It\u2019d work well for prison divorces.", "Anyway, and then you come to terms with something and you come up with a deal.", "Then you\u2019re editing it like a Google Doc, essentially?", "Yes. ", "Right?", "Yes.", "Then you do what? You finally come to an agreement about it and then what?", "Depending on which package. We have a $750 package, a $1,500 package, and a $2,500 package.", "Explain.", "The more you pay, and again, none of them\u2019s more than $2,500, the more we do for you in terms of taking your documents, taking them to the courthouse, getting them filed, paying your court fees. You want to do it yourself? Give us the $750. We\u2019ll give you the forms. You still have access to the full site, but you\u2019re going to be going to court, you\u2019re going to be serving the documents, etc. For the full premier package, the $2,500, we pay those court fees, we serve your spouse. Again, it\u2019s not going to be jumping out of the bushes, \u201cHa ha, you\u2019re served,\u201d because he or she\u2019s going to know we\u2019re coming because you\u2019re on the same page. Then it gets done, and then you\u2019re divorced.", "Then that\u2019s it?", "You never leave your couch.", "Then that\u2019s it? You don\u2019t have to visit anyone and stuff like that? Why did you think this was a area ripe\u2026? Just because it\u2019s such an onerous way to live, essentially, or to divorce?", "Because I do believe that there is an easier way to do it. I wrote a book in 2013. I guess that was my foray. I have so many friends that have nowhere near the money that my clients have, who\u2019ve said to me, \u201cWhat have you seen? What have you learned? What do you know?\u201d This has always been my theory, which is, this isn\u2019t a fender-bender. You\u2019re going to know this person, probably, for the rest of your life. Better figure out a way to get along with he or she, because you\u2019re going to walk down the aisle, go to college graduations, be in the delivery room. I watched my parents do it in the most respectful, civilized, wonderful way. I\u2019ve watched them, as an adult, with my kids and what I\u2019ve done. ", "That\u2019s what I preach, and that\u2019s what I practice. I have two kids with two different dads. We don\u2019t have a piece of paper between us. Now, again, I don\u2019t recommend that. I can do it, because I\u2019m a family law attorney and because the relationships we have are very special. But I know it\u2019s possible. I know it\u2019s possible to get through this, raise really well-adjusted kids, handle financial matters, have everybody for Thanksgiving, sometimes do a bit of a family vacation crossover together, and have a really good, meaningful life where your kids have a lot of people that love them and care about them.", "I mean, I think the way it\u2019s been done, I want to talk about it in the next section, has been ... the analog way it\u2019s been done does promote not getting along. It\u2019s interesting that tech could be a solution for that. Are there any glitches that happen on this site, then? People just have to agree, and then you have to click together?", "If you hit a wall, because of The Index, which is our referral, you can go meet a mediator that you hire that has nothing to do with our site, but we\u2019ll refer you to him or her. Spend an hour or two with somebody really talking through the benefits of parochial school versus public school versus private, non-denominational, whatever. Go through that. See if you can figure it out. If you can, great. Then you go back to the site, you figure out what you\u2019ve put in there, where the kids are going, legal custody, etc., and you file it.", "You all put it into the legalese that\u2019s necessary?", "Yes. Really, most of the states have boiled it down on forms. There is a couple of pages that we\u2019ll have to help you write up in some states. For the most part, yes.", "How many people do it this way now? I mean, talk about the numbers, because people don\u2019t think of divorce in that fashion. ", "Well, it\u2019s coming along. We launched in January. We have completed, I think, over 300 divorces thus far, so that\u2019s 11 months. I know that\u2019s ...", "This is just in California. ", "No, no. This is in New York and California. ", "Oh, okay. So this is ... you all have to have the ability to do it in those states, right? You can\u2019t do 50 states. ", "Well, we will do 50 states by the end, hopefully, of 2019. ", "Okay. But talk about ... you can only do it in two states now why?", "Because out of everything else that I\u2019m very good at, tech is not one of those things. So I\u2019ve had to hire outside people to come up with the tech and get us up to speed so that we can download the forms from other states. I also don\u2019t know the law in all the other states.", "But you can practice in all the other states.", "I can\u2019t. I can only practice in California, but you don\u2019t need a lawyer to get divorced on It\u2019s Over Easy. So you don\u2019t have to have any interaction with me at all, at least not as an attorney. Because it\u2019s kind of a mom-and-pop shop, I will sometimes be up in the middle of the night on the phone with somebody going, \u201cNo, you need to push this and this is how you can get back into the system,\u201d or whatever, but not as a lawyer. We don\u2019t give legal advice. ", "Mm-hmm. Talk a little about getting to more states and globally, because presumably, you\u2019ve got to get people to get used to the idea of doing it digitally, which they do everything else digitally.", "Right. And it\u2019s been pretty quick to pick up. Again, I think some of that has been the help of our friends at LegalZoom. But also, it\u2019s been quick to pick up because people ... look, they\u2019re not leaving their houses. They\u2019re doing everything online. So when you order all your Christmas gifts online and they show up ...", "Which the people used...", "Exactly. And you do your banking, and so then you\u2019re like, \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I just do this? I don\u2019t have to see him in person. I don\u2019t have to go to a lawyer.\u201d Most of the time at my firm ...", "And do the sit across the table thing.", "Yeah, the thing like from ", "Wedding Crashers", " where Rebecca De Mornay says, \u201cDon\u2019t you open your mouth. Don\u2019t you talk to me.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cWait, what?\u201d Greatest scene ever.", "Divorce lawyers are always really awful in movies.", "They are.", "It\u2019s really speaking about the media.", "By the way, a lot of us are awful in person, too. ", "Okay, good to know, good to know.", "Think about the kind of person that wants to become a divorce lawyer.", "That\u2019s true.", "It\u2019s like a meter maid, divorce lawyer.", "Yeah, exactly, okay. Are they the same thing?", "I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know that many meter maids, actually, but they could be nicer. There is a problem inherent to the fact and, like I said, I say it all the time, with somebody who makes money from conflict. Now, there are fabulous family law attorneys that I have met in this process, not only that I\u2019ve known most of my life here in Southern California, but in Northern California, in New York, and then the other states that I\u2019m branching out to, I have called on people that are kind of at the top of their field and said, \u201cHey, this is my thing. Check it out. There\u2019s a video. What do you think?\u201d And without exception, every single person that I\u2019ve approached has said, \u201cOh my God, this is amazing.\u201d Now, if they were all horrible people that were just trying to turn their fees, they wouldn\u2019t be saying that. We all want some change. We all want people to approach things better. We all want to be problem solvers and get it done. ", "Are there people that have gone to the dark side? Yeah, there are. But most of the people I came up knowing, because again, my dad did this, and so I met his colleagues. And the people that have been in our community are really great people, smart, wise ...", "But still, inherently, the analog version is conflict.", "Yeah, or settling conflict. You can have a client that is just absolutely so difficult to deal with. Those people are not going to be the people that use It\u2019s Over Easy, they won\u2019t be able to.", "Okay, so you have 300 just in New York, how do you ...", "No, California and New York.", "California and New York, I\u2019m sorry. And they have to just download the forms. That\u2019s all you have to do to get people to use it in the different states.", "And know a little bit about the law there because even if we\u2019re not giving legal advice, we have to be able to tell them you\u2019ve got six months before this, or here\u2019s the courthouse that we\u2019re going to file your documents in. One of the big problems and why it\u2019s been so hard to get arms around this is, even in California, there\u2019s so many different counties and each county has its own different, not forms, but the courtrooms have a different way of doing things. Los Angeles Superior hasn\u2019t even gotten electronic filing yet. That\u2019s how difficult it\u2019s been. So it\u2019s really, really a big project.", "So you actually physically bring it down there?", "Yeah. Now, that\u2019s not the case in Santa Barbara, I mean you can electronically file in several other departments in several other outgoing courts. But the biggest one in Southern California is Stanley Mosk downtown, and we\u2019ve been working on it for a long time. It\u2019s a huge project.", "So why is that? Talk about that because part of your business is filing. You\u2019re going to lose money if you have to hand-deliver documents to courts and get them Bate stamped or whatever.", "That is true.", "Is that what it\u2019s called, Bate stamp?", "Yeah. Well, no, that\u2019s not Bate stamping. You\u2019re getting confirmed copies. Bate stamps is the number so that you can say, \u201cI gave you 47562.\u201d", "Yeah, I once dated one of those people who does that.", "A Bate stamper?", "Yeah, a long time ago.", "How boring.", "It didn\u2019t go well.", "It was like somebody that works in a toll booth.", "Yeah, exactly.", "Maybe they had a really good imagination.", "What is it called when people work or law firms but they\u2019re not a lawyer?", "Paralegal.", "Paralegal, that\u2019s what they did.", "They were a Bate stamper?", "Yeah. Do they do that anymore?", "Yes.", "Oh my god.", "Yes.", "We\u2019re going to talk about why law is so behind, in general. You have to physically bring things down still for your business?", "But we have process servers. We have guys that we work with on motorcycles and \u2014 ", "zzzt", " \u2014 they get down there, they do it. But yes, eventually you will do electronic filing everywhere and that will make things simpler for everybody.", "What\u2019s been the slowdown for that?", "There\u2019s just so many and we don\u2019t have a ton of funding for it, federally or state-wide. And so we\u2019re just getting up to speed.", "Right, getting up to speed in terms of what we\u2019re going to do. All right. What states are going to? All of them this year?", "No. ", "Or where the most divorces are.", "Interestingly, 18 to 20 percent of the divorces in the US happen in New York and California.", "Oh, man.", "California is, absolutely, by far the highest.", "Wow.", "Then New York.", "And at least six of those are Donald Trump\u2019s, but go ahead.", "And then it drops. Then the rest of the states, you\u2019ve got like, I think, Florida, Chicago, Texas ...", "That\u2019s because that\u2019s where the people are, right?", "Right. Well, that\u2019s where the people are and that\u2019s where higher divorce rates are. We may never be fully operational in Rhode Island because it may not necessarily make sense. We will probably have a downloadable version of it that we can still help people. So right now, it\u2019s just kind of getting up to speed. So I believe that in January ... and we have also done a bit of an Uber. We won\u2019t go statewide in some of those, we\u2019ll do cities.", "\u201cA bit of an Uber.\u201d", "A bit of an Uber on that. Rather than going all of Massachusetts, we\u2019re going to do Boston. We won\u2019t do all of Florida just yet, we\u2019ll do Dade County, which is Miami. We\u2019ll do probably Chicago in Illinois and, I think, Denver, Colorado. The biggest cities that get divorce in. We\u2019re doing Houston in Texas, we decided, because they have the biggest divorce rate, even bigger than Austin or Dallas.", "Wow.", "So we\u2019ll launch in those and then we\u2019ll kind of slowly, word of mouth, grow, outward growth. It is kind of a grassroots advertising. We\u2019re using the brand that is me to do some of it. And again, we\u2019re small, we\u2019re a startup. A lot of this has been bootstrapped, the funding for it.", "What funding have you gotten? Just you?", "Not just me. Friends and family that I\u2019ve either known for a long time, did good work on their divorces, and they really see a need for change and wanting to help. But it\u2019s been pretty much on a shoestring so far, and we\u2019ve done well with it.", "Have you approached venture capitalists? You\u2019ve got Mark Schuster here, you\u2019ve got a lot of people.", "I even went up to your neck of the woods and had some meetings. They said at the beginning I was too small. I may go out again. I also don\u2019t want to lose too much control over it.", "When you say you\u2019re too small, it\u2019s not a big enough ...", "At the time, yeah. I mean look, there\u2019s only a certain amount of divorces every year. I do believe that there is kind of a lead gen revenue opportunity on some of the index stuff that we\u2019ve done. And then, certainly, the content, as well. It\u2019s interesting. ", "When I did my book in 2013, I have never had a publicist before in my career. The publishing house actually got a PR person and so many of the television shows and print media said, \u201cOoh, we don\u2019t like divorce. This sounds like a really good idea\u2026\u201d It was called ", "It Doesn\u2019t Have to Be That Way", ". \u201cBut, yeah\u2026\u201d And that was \u201813. Now, fast-forward five years to 2018 when we launched It\u2019s Over Easy, ", "everybody", " wanted to have me on their show, in their ad or whatever because it was interesting and they realized that legal tech is going to eat the world and this is a really good way of approaching it. ", "So things are changing, but again, I think people were a little bit like, \u201cWell, how do I go home and tell my wife over dinner in my Silicon Valley mansion that I\u2019m putting money into a divorce website?\u201d So they\u2019re waiting to see how we do. And again, smart people that you and I mutually know have said to me, if you can afford to keep this small for now and do it the way you want to do it, then do, because you don\u2019t want to have somebody acquire so much of you that you don\u2019t have the control, that you can\u2019t still give people the kind of content that you really want to give them, and also give them the referrals that you want to give them if that\u2019s what\u2019s important to you.", "At the same time, this is very typical for what a startup does. It attacks an industry that\u2019s overpriced and over-bloated, essentially, and hard, purposely hard, makes it easy and cuts prices. That\u2019s the whole point.", "Yes.", "That\u2019s how all of them do it, essentially. So when you were talking about an Uber, an Uber for divorce, essentially, how do you look at it?", "I think it\u2019s more of a TurboTax for divorce, but the launching, what I was told \u2014 and again, I don\u2019t know much about any of this, but I like Uber, I take Ubers \u2014 is that when they launched, they would do a city as opposed to an entire state.", "Yes, they did. Yes, that\u2019s true.", "So that was my point, that I would do Miami as opposed to all of Florida.", "Talk about the broader sort of legal environment when you\u2019re thinking ... There is TurboTax for accounting, you have that company doing that. You have LegalZoom doing documents and stuff like that. Talk about the legal profession and its slowness. Like Los Angeles, I didn\u2019t realize it doesn\u2019t have electronic filing. It\u2019s really kind of astonishing.", "It is astonishing. Why is the law the last thing to change? Why is it that same-sex couples couldn\u2019t get married until a couple of years ago?", "Well, that\u2019s another issue, that has nothing to do with tech or anything.", "It has nothing to do with tech, but it is an inability to kind of wrap our heads around what issues are important and make those issues to push forward. And again, divorce has always kind of been the ugly stepchild of law. When my dad first started practicing divorce here in Southern California in the \u201960s, it was because young Jewish men, forget women, couldn\u2019t get jobs doing anything but family law, matrimonial, or personal injury. They couldn\u2019t get hired at the white-collar law firms that do taxes and all that downtown.", "White shoe, I think they call it white shoe.", "So that\u2019s what he went into because it was the schlepper version. And then he rose to the top of his field and he actually represented Billie Jean King in what was the first galimony/palimony case.", "I remember that.", "So there is a field, but we\u2019re not curing cancer or anything, we are doing something that I believe that will make it easier for people. And I talk to so many people that are our age that said, \u201cOh, my parents went through a horrible divorce and now I\u2019m going to go through a horrible divorce.\u201d Why should that be? Breaking up sucks, there\u2019s no question about it. But we\u2019ve all been in a relationship and broken up and we\u2019ve prevailed, and withstood, and moved on. Why are we so reluctant to change the way we approach this and do it the way it sounds like you and your ex did it, me and my exes have done it. It\u2019s not fun, but it is certainly something that we need to figure out how to get through for our kids.", "If you think about it, if you insert a screen between you, even though now screens are so decried, that\u2019s the latest thing is to...", "Oh, believe me.", "It does create a distance that is probably appropriate, potentially appropriate. ", "Yes. I tell people to handle their divorces like a business transaction, because they often don\u2019t. There\u2019s one partner that says, \u201cI\u2019ve got nothing to lose, here she\u2019s paying the fees. I\u2019m going to run this up. I\u2019m going to be hysterical. I\u2019m going to argue about that coffee cup all day long because I can.\u201d Taking that out of the equation and saying, \u201cWait a minute, get all of the emotional and therapeutic help you need. Pay somebody else that\u2019s really good at that, don\u2019t pay your lawyers.\u201d ", "Because most of us, frankly, don\u2019t know what it takes to get through the grieving process and what the tips and tools are to communicate effectively with your ex. I\u2019ve picked up some stuff over 25 years professionally and personally, but wouldn\u2019t you want to be paying, even at the very highest, $350 to somebody who\u2019s actually got a degree in this as opposed to $850 to me who doesn\u2019t know anything and just keeps having kids with people and breaking up?", "When you think about the overall idea of it, you go international? Or is that just too difficult?", "Well, no, people have approached me, and actually, this morning I got a letter from a woman in England saying, \u201cI really want to bring this. Can you help us with the app?\u201d I mean, absolutely. It\u2019s ...", "So you give an app too? It\u2019s an app and ...", "I always say it\u2019s very difficult to get divorced on your phone on the subway, but you can sign up, you can certainly go through the content. You can get the referrals, but you don\u2019t want to fill out an income and expense declaration on your phone.", "That would be great. You can date on an app on your phone.", "Well, it is an app. When you join, we ping you. The other thing that we\u2019ve had issues with in terms of glitches, you asked, it\u2019s kind of weird to get a ping. Maybe you haven\u2019t told your partner yet that you\u2019re getting divorced and it\u2019s, \u201cHey, it\u2019s the Over Easy, just checking in. How are you doing?\u201d So we want to be very sensitive to that because it\u2019s private and personal and we don\u2019t cold call. We send emails, but it always has kind of a weird re: line so that people can feel comfortable getting comfortable with us and getting to know us just like you would a divorce lawyer.", "Right. In terms of notifications and things like that.", "Yes, yes.", "Why couldn\u2019t you get to an app divorce?", "You could.", "The level of information.", "It\u2019s just that the forms that the state still mandates that you complete would be really small. You\u2019d have to have a bigger phone. I mean, again, you could totally do it. We have the app available, but probably filling them out, you\u2019re going to need to see them a little bigger.", "Right, exactly. So where do you want to take it? So you have 300, you want to get bigger. That\u2019s too small.", "Oh, it\u2019s too small. And again, it does take a little while, but we want to make it bigger. I also want to have something that will have a tail on it. Once the divorce is over, we\u2019re done. You can still be part of our community. I\u2019d love it to be that we\u2019ve got a banking app on there so that people can share their expenses and reconcile the accounts together. A communication portal for parents to be able to talk to each other. I have all kinds of great founder ideas and all of my tech engineers are like, \u201cSlow your roll, lady. Let\u2019s just see if we can get into Florida, okay?\u201d", "We\u2019re here with divorce attorney Laura Wasser. We\u2019ve been talking about getting divorced online. I think it\u2019s fantastic. I think never seeing people again is a great idea for people who don\u2019t get along. But you do share children and things like that. ", "You were talking about where it goes because I think one of the things is how we live our lives digitally so much more. And it replaces a lot of what has been sort of onerous scheduling and onerous and dis-coordinated and stuff like that. So you could have a scheduling ... you\u2019re talking about a post-divorce life?", "Yeah, sure.", "That you all also conduct that. ", "Yes.", "Because one of the problems with your business is you only get divorced once, maybe a couple. Again, if you\u2019re Donald Trump, you get one several times. But you only have a few of them in you. And so it\u2019s a problem. It\u2019s the same thing with a lot of businesses.", "But you\u2019re going to be dealing with that person, particularly if you have kids, for a long time. So there are certain things that we could add to this. Right now, we have a co-parenting calendar. There could be something that allows the user to continue using that co-parenting calendar. And again, the law is always there. You can always, as a backup, run down to court and argue about who had winter vacation 2018 or whatever.", "Right.", "But if you have that somewhere in your phone or computer and you\u2019ve kept the app and here\u2019s where she said \u201cNo, no, no, I want this year because it\u2019s my mother\u2019s 80th birthday,\u201d or whatever.", "So it creates a trail.", "Yeah, so that\u2019s helpful too. ", "Oh, a text trail.", "I think you and I do that even without being conscious of it because I am horrible and I don\u2019t erase my texts, not to have any kind of a trail, just because that\u2019s how I am. So when I say to my ex, \u201cHey, I\u2019m going to pick him up at 3:00 after his first day of school on Thursday.\u201d And then I forget that I said I was going to do that and the kid is waiting at the school and my ex goes, \u201cDude, you said you were picking them up. Here\u2019s the text.\u201d If you had all that in one place, wouldn\u2019t that be great?", "Yeah.", "So it\u2019s that kind of stuff that we use, that we don\u2019t even consciously use it. Let\u2019s put it all in one place, do it all in an app. Get the nanny looped in if she needs to be looped in. Get the grandparents looped in if they need to be looped in, and at some point even loop the judge in if you end up in front of him or her. ", "It\u2019s not a ... Like there\u2019s been a lot of companies that are trying to do this with elder care and things like this. ", "Yes.", "Like, the idea. The legal problems around elder care, and then also the care problems of the idea of living your life online.", "Can you talk ... I want to go into ... and the last part is talking about the legal profession and it\u2019s sort of ... It\u2019s been one of the few professions that has been resistant to digital, more so than others. Now, there\u2019s obviously LegalZoom, there\u2019s Documents, and things like that, but in general, there still is an analog relationship... I just hired a lawyer for something, and I was like, \u201cDo I need a lawyer?\u201d I guess I did, and I didn\u2019t ", "want", " to need a lawyer, you know what I mean?", "Part of it is ... And I\u2019m not advocating for people to give up on lawyers. At some point, you may need somebody who really is a specialist in their field to be able to give you sound advice. And furthermore, represent you and be your advocate in front of a judicial officer. That may be important. ", "And you don\u2019t want to mess it up at the early stages by going, \u201cOh, I can do this myself.\u201d I get clients sometimes at my firm who are like, \u201cI represented myself and I did this, then I did this, then I did this,\u201d and I was like, \u201cOh, I don\u2019t want to have anything to do with you. Let me send you somewhere else, because you totally messed it up.\u201d", "I think there will always be a place for people to get representation that they need and have advocates. That\u2019s important. But I think for some of the smaller, simpler things ... My goal is to make the divorce process simpler for people. And to force people to educate themselves and learn about it for the benefit of their families.", "I\u2019ve had so many famous people come to me ... They don\u2019t come to me, they send their assistants. \u201cCan you meet with my assistant?\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know, is your assistant the legal guardian of your kids?\u201d \u201cWell no, but I\u2019m really busy, and I\u2019ve got a blowout, and I\u2019ve got a lip plump,\u201d and whatever.", "I said, \u201cWell then, let me give you the name of one of my colleagues who\u2019s great, but if we\u2019re dealing with kids, I kind of need to meet you. You don\u2019t need to come to my office. I\u2019ll come to you. But you need to be part of the process.\u201d I think everybody should be part of the process. I think everybody should have the opportunity. And so many people that don\u2019t have a ton of money really want to know, and then you\u2019ve got the lawyers that are like, \u201cI\u2019ve got this for you. Let me throw some legalese in here and confuse you, and then I\u2019ll do it.\u201d That shouldn\u2019t be the case, either.", "There has to be a happy medium where people own what they\u2019re going through, take some responsibility. We simplify the law and the forms and get it done. And I\u2019m not saying, \u201cOh, laissez faire, isn\u2019t it casual, let\u2019s get divorced and move on,\u201d and whatever, but let\u2019s realize that if it\u2019s not working out, isn\u2019t it better for kids to see two happy parents alone or in relationships with new people than it is to see miserable parents that hate each other?", "Yes, 100 percent. Getting to the larger thing of legal, do you ever imagine ... Because some people are thinking, people talk about the impact of AI, the impact of all kinds of the things. One of the things I always say is, anything that can be digitized will be digitized. And so much of law, including divorce law, seems so digitizable and so not in need of ... Given how complex it is, but these advanced computer and machine learning systems can really anticipate everything and offer things...", "Do you imagine that the law, people in the law understand that so much of what they do is going to be replaced?", "I am definitely seeing that in ...", "And I\u2019m not talking robots, yet. Robot lawyers, why not.", "No, no. But I\u2019m seeing ... Look, even my older colleagues. My dad just turned 76. He has been forced to figure out how to use his iPhone. He spent an hour with my kids on New Year\u2019s Day learning how to do the cartoon emojis that talk, of himself, so we get that every once in a while blasting into our house.", "When we first all got computers and desktops at our office, there were two or three of the older partners who said, \u201cI don\u2019t want a computer.\u201d", "There\u2019s beyond that. So much of what you do -", "No, I get it. But even that resistance. So much of what we do, it\u2019s like therapy online. Can people really do therapy online? Can you really have a digital app that explains, \u201cOkay, calm down. Take four deep breaths. Now respond to your partner,\u201d or whatever. Could the same thing happen?", "For a lot of it, I think it could happen in law. Are people afraid of that? Some of them are afraid of it and some of them are in complete denial about it. Or figure, I only got this many years left. I don\u2019t care if that happens, because I\u2019m going to be on the golf course by that time, so it doesn\u2019t matter.", "Right, and so when you think about law, like law in general, is it ... To me, it\u2019s completely ripe for utter disruption and hasn\u2019t been yet. It has been, a little bit, largely because the legislatures are controlled by lawyers. And they create complex situations. But when you bring in machine learning and self-learning computers, it becomes different. Because you can see a robotic lawyer. You can see a ... So many of these things are so pattern-based.", "Totally. And yet ... I mean, look. There has been a bit of a shift over the past 20 years in terms of custody, at least in Southern California. Not so many other states, but even Southern more than Northern. Going, why would it be that the mom should have the kids?", "So we have, but slow. So slow. Come on, it\u2019s 2019. Are we really even having that conversation anymore? Why would a father, male, not be as good of a parent as a female, if both of them were raising the kids before they split up? So, that stuff has shifted.", "Look, I think there\u2019s always going to need to be a bit of a human touch, and I think that\u2019s important. Rather than disrupting the legal field, which is what so many people have told me that I\u2019m doing, I want to disrupt the family field. I want people, parties, to come to the table from a different perspective, and then say to them, \u201cIf you need a lawyer because it\u2019s complex, you say to your lawyer, \u2018I\u2019m watching you. And I\u2019m watching your letters, and I\u2019m watching how you interact with the other attorney. Don\u2019t you spend my money getting into a pissing contest with that person.\u2019\u201d", "Right. What\u2019s been the reaction to this?", "Mostly great.", "Other lawyers, too?", "Other lawyers have said ... Either they\u2019ve kind of patted me and said, \u201cThat\u2019s nice. Go help the poor people. We\u2019ll take the rich people.\u201d I haven\u2019t had anybody overtly say to me, \u201cYou\u2019re killing our practice,\u201d because the people that I\u2019ve spoken to ... Look, you kind of have to jump on board. You can\u2019t say like, \u201cHey, you\u2019re pulling back the curtain in Emerald City.\u201d", "For the most part, I believe that family law practitioners want to simplify and make it easier for people. There have been a few people that have said, \u201cIt\u2019ll never work. People are always going to need somebody there to hold their hands. People are always going to need advocates.\u201d", "I think it\u2019s because it\u2019s complex.", "It is needlessly complex, and hopefully ... Maybe I\u2019m the tail wagging the dog here, but hopefully the legislature will go, \u201cMaybe we could simplify this. Maybe we could make it easier for people to get through this part of what they\u2019re going through, and then on to the next.\u201d Canada\u2019s completely revamping their system. Alberta. From the inside. From the family, outward.", "Doing?", "Making it kid-based. I don\u2019t even think they call it family law. I think they call it children\u2019s rights law, or something like that. But this is for the money aspect, too. They\u2019ve broken down the system. They\u2019re changing the legislature, and they\u2019re taking it from the inside out. All based on kids and what their needs are.", "So, I\u2019d like to have our system follow that somehow. My main thing is bringing it to light. Giving people an education. Letting people see how it can be done better. And then, the rest of it I think will fall in line. I\u2019m not as interested in legal tech eating the world as I am ...", "You said that, though. You said legal tech eating the world.", "I think it will. People have told me ...", "What did you mean by that?", "I think that eventually you will probably be able to do just about everything legally online. I think people will embrace it and I think that the technology will be better, and so people will do it.", "And the litigation that we have in the United States, I hope, will be reduced, and only the really important things will be the things that are tried in front of judicial officers. Because there\u2019s an impossible glut in our courtrooms, too.", "Right. Right. Do you imagine there will be AI judges? That would be ...", "Some of them actually kind of are. It\u2019s very artificial intelligence.", "No, but it\u2019s interesting. Like, I think about it in medicine. I think about it in law. There\u2019s diagnostics. Doctors are just not any good at it. Lots of doctors are. But do you know what I mean? Like, the way that we think of them?", "Well, yeah. Wasn\u2019t the first thing when none of us were willing to get into a computerized car to drive us somewhere? I mean, then wouldn\u2019t we let somebody take out our kidney if it was a robot? And then, wouldn\u2019t we let somebody make that decision from a judicial standpoint? That makes me a little bit nervous, frankly.", "Why?", "Because I feel like I would want a real human taking out my kidney and I would want a real human deciding issues ... Important issues regarding custody. Not Wednesday nights, but if my kid had some kind of a disease and I wanted to have some treatment, and then his other parent wanted to have a different kind of treatment, I would want a real person. ", "But why?", "I don\u2019t know.", "What if it\u2019s a better decision?", "What if it\u2019s a better ... Because I don\u2019t know what a better decision is. But I don\u2019t know that I\u2019m willing to trust ... Again, I was born in \u201868. I grew up seeing a person in a black robe that was a judge and he or she was smart and educated and had a heart and did the right thing. That\u2019s what we see in the movies. That\u2019s what we\u2019re supposed to think. Can a robot do that? I don\u2019t know.", "It\u2019s really interesting when you think about it, because we have allowed ... We used to wander through stores. And now, the shift is so dramatic, among young people, especially. In terms of how they don\u2019t. And I do not like to. I wrote a whole column. This is what it took to get me in a store.", "Don\u2019t talk to me, don\u2019t offer me ...

So far, they seem to be delivering some relief to employees affected by cuts. But unions have their limits.", "In theory, the most important power unions offer employees in times of turmoil is a seat at the table. That means that in the case of downsizing, merger or sale, management is obligated to negotiate in good faith with members of the union\u2019s bargaining committee to minimize the impact to workers. ", "That committee is typically comprised of a group of unionized employees at the company who negotiate on behalf of their colleagues.

Similarly, Vox Media\u2019s bargaining committee has made negotiations with management over terms of layoffs, even though the union does not yet have a contract in place with the company.", "In Mic\u2019s case, since the company was short on cash and therefore sold at a fraction of its valuation, there\u2019s only so much financial compensation for employees the union can bargain for.", "Nastaran Mohit, an official with the NewsGuild of New York, which represents former Mic employees, wrote in an email to ", "Recode", ", \u201cThe financial situation at the company was even worse than was reported, and the Guild has spent the last several weeks extracting every dollar possible.\u201d ", "The union has also publicly criticized the company\u2019s handling of the sale to ", "Bustle Digital Group", ", accusing Mic of union busting since it ", "laid off all of its unionized staff", ". If that claim has merit, the union could file a charge with the National Labor Relations Board, the NLRB, which could take punitive measures against Mic, including forcing the media company back to the bargaining table with the union. ", "Sometimes, in best-case scenarios for employees, unions can help avoid layoffs altogether by negotiating organizational restructuring or voluntary buyouts instead. ", "When Gizmodo Media\u2019s new parent company, Univision, initially wanted to lay off 30 percent of the editorial staff, the union successfully bargained for voluntary exits instead. The parties agreed on buyout packages for close to 20 percent of editorial staff members. Those packages included 18 weeks of pay and healthcare.", "\u201cIt\u2019s a great tangible example of what your union can do, and it\u2019s important that people know we were able to do this just because we put our minds to it,\u201d said Hamilton Nolan, senior writer at Splinter, a Gizmodo site. \u201cGiven the fact we\u2019re living in an era where there\u2019s going to be a lot more media consolidation, sales and spinoffs, a union contract is going to go a long way toward making your life easier if you do find yourself in that position.\u201d", "But there are limits to unions\u2019 powers. A union can\u2019t prevent a media company from going under or stop a merger from happening. In the case of a merger between two companies, usually the buyer will recognize an existing union, but in the case of an asset sale they might have to renegotiate a contract from scratch, according to Lowell Peterson, executive director of WGAE. Peterson said, however, that in the cases of digital media mergers his union has helped negotiate so far, the contract has stayed in place.", "And in the case of an asset sale where the company meaningfully changes its business \u2014 like a spinoff to a company in a different industry \u2014 there\u2019s a chance the union could be dissolved altogether. What\u2019s worse, there\u2019s virtually no union protection if a company completely shuts down.

But anyways, let\u2019s bust into some of the biggest stories of the week. And I\u2019d love to get your thoughts.", "Amazon passes Apple and Microsoft to become the most valuable company in the world. So some boasting here, I\u2019ve been predicting this for several years and finally, it\u2019s happening. I would argue that it\u2019s kind of the baton been handed off from the iPhone to voice. Have you thought at all, Professor, about voice and what it might, how it might actually impact some of the things you talk about? The pervasiveness of technology in our lives and in our homes and our kids kind of growing up with this always-on technology?", "I haven\u2019t thought much about it. We only just got our first device, somebody gave us the Google, little Google thing. The only thought I have on it is that I\u2019m very concerned, as we\u2019ll talk about later, about the way that the touch technologies, I think, are a ", "lot", " more addictive than, say, television screens that you and I grew up with. They\u2019re interactive in a way, the way that slot machines are. And so far, I think voice is probably not going to be like that. I mean, conversation with the thing is, you know, kind of fun, kind of frustrating. But it doesn\u2019t make people turn into, you know, the person sitting at the slot machine for hours on end.", "So you think it\u2019s less insidious than the touch stuff. And our colleague, Adam Alter, has written a great book on this, ", "Irresistible", ". ", "Next big story, I don\u2019t know if you saw this, but Bezos, or MacKenzie Bezos, is about to become the fifth-wealthiest person in the world, as they\u2019re splitting up. And a private matter, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that newsworthy. But the thing that I thought was kind of interesting was the press release. And I just want to read a line from it. \u201cWe feel incredibly lucky to have found each other and deeply grateful every one of the years we\u2019ve been married,\u201d blah, blah, blah... \u201cWe\u2019ve had such a great life together as a married couple.

And by the way, and I\u2019m pretty sure Bezos listens to this, that procedure he\u2019s about to have every three years called a colonoscopy isn\u2019t an invasive piece of metal inside, it\u2019s a hot stone massage of his innards. Who writes this shit? Seriously. And if I, okay. ", "So moving on\u2026 Zuckerberg says his \u201819 resolution is to host a series of public discussions about the future of technology and society. What do you think of Mark Zuckerberg going on tour to talk about this stuff?", "Well, I think the fundamental problem that you and I are gonna be talking about is that social media and technology have put us all into a social space where whatever we say, various strangers with assumed names are going to say incredibly nasty things about us. Which makes us all reluctant to speak in public and which kind of decimates trust and a speak-up culture within companies and within the public square. So I would say that Facebook and other social media companies are part of the very reason why the idea of a public conversation is rather unpleasant to most people. I don\u2019t think we can really have public conversations anymore. ", "It feels as if there\u2019s an entire industry that\u2019s developed in shaming and being a victim. Or that the moment you say, and actually I think I stole this line from you, the moment you\u2019re offended, you\u2019re automatically right. ", "That\u2019s right. ", "So there\u2019s, go ahead. ", "Yeah, I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s an industry. It\u2019s rather more that you have to look at any conversation in terms of what people are trying to do. And people are always concerned about getting prestige. And to the extent that technology changes social dynamics so that when two people are talking, they\u2019re not necessarily talking to each other. They\u2019re talking to the, possibly a very large audience. That changes the nature of interaction, and generally, in bad ways.", "Yeah, and what would you say, what platform embodies the worst of that? Is it Twitter? Is it Facebook? If you spend time looking at the different platforms... ", "Yeah, I\u2019m on Twitter. And that is certainly terrible for this. I mean, Twitter does a lot of good things, I\u2019ll get a lot of information. But the dynamics, and I see it myself too, we don\u2019t speak up openly and honestly and fully, at least hardly any of us do. Facebook I\u2019m not really on. I have an account, but I don\u2019t use it much. I think, you know, longer form, more emphasis on interacting with friends is not as bad. But it\u2019s so pervasive that I think Facebook, Instagram, I think all of them change the dynamics and put us in this prestige economy, you could say, where we\u2019re really concerned about how others will read", "This is a segue into your book, but I think it\u2019s an important one. You write a lot about this, some of the wealthier universities or some of the areas, wealthier areas that are popular with the universities, kind of the vibe has changed. What\u2019s happened there, Jon?", "So beginning of 2015, we saw some, or 2014 really, we began to see some funny things on campus. We began to see students protesting over speakers. Now they\u2019ve done that since the 60s, on and off. But it was always protesting \u201cthis person\u2019s offensive, we don\u2019t want this person here, because we hate their ideas.\u201d But for the first time, around 2014, we started getting students protesting because a speaker would be \u201cdangerous,\u201d or a book would be \u201cdangerous.\u201d And so they would request a trigger warning. So there was this new idea that students are fragile and that adults need to protect students from books, words, ideas, and speakers. And this completely confounded most of us. What are they talking about? Like violence, how is reading a book violence? And so there was this new moral culture that we didn\u2019t understand in 2014, 2015. And then it spread very widely in late 2015, beginning with, there were protests at Yale and then it spread to dozens and dozens of other schools.", "So there\u2019s a kind of a moral incoherence on campus now, where a lot of us are in the older culture in which we think what we\u2019re doing is pursuing truth and transmitting it. But a lot of students, not most, but some students in certain departments think that the point of us being together I campus is to fight for certain kinds of justice and to battle oppression. And so we have incoherence in the classroom, where people are pursuing different goals. And there are mechanisms by which people can prosecute each other.", "And you mentioned that there are six factors that have given rise to this generation of kind of fragility, if you will. What were some of the other factors?", "Yeah, so the fragility part, so we\u2019ll get into the mental health in a moment, but there\u2019s a huge rise of anxiety and depression in students born after 1995. And that actually is one of the six contributing factors. When you suddenly have a big influx of students who have anxiety disorders and depression, they are prone to see things as dangerous, threatening. You know, basic experiments, you bring people in the lab, if someone has an anxiety disorder and you show them random pictures, they\u2019re going to see more lions and tigers and bears and ambiguous situations. And so if the speaker comes to campus or if a book is assigned and most people are like, \u201cOkay. The Great Gatsby. Okay, we can read that.\u201d But somebody says, \u201cOh my god, there\u2019s, you know, there\u2019s violence against women in it. There\u2019s classism, there\u2019s all kinds of bad stuff. You know, we can\u2019t read that.\u201d So the idea of seeing books and words and ideas as threatening, dangerous, violence, it\u2019s hard for most people to see that. But for people who are depressed or anxious, it\u2019s easier to believe that. So that\u2019s one, the rise of depression, anxiety.", "The other really big ones are the ", "huge", " overprotection that Americans began doing in the 1990s. And so when I travel around the country talking about the book, I always ask people, how old were you when you were let out? That is when you could go outside, walk to a friend\u2019s house, you and your friend go to a park or, you know, go to a store or something. And I always say, \u201cOkay, people born before 1982,\u201d so Gen X and older. And the answer is always six, plus or minus one or two, nobody says 10. It was always first grade or maybe second or third at latest. And then I say, \u201cNow just students, just people born after 1995.\u201d So that\u2019s Gen Z. And the answer is never below 10, it\u2019s anywhere from 10 to 14.", "And so what we did in the 90s, so this is kind of crazy, but, you know, when you and I were growing up, I\u2019m 54, 55 or something like that and when we were growing up, there was a huge crime wave. I mean, it was actually kind of dangerous to be outside. ", "Yeah there was real crime. ", "Yeah. Now, you know, the criminals rarely would hurt kids, but there ", "was", " a lot of crime. And then just as the crime rate is plummeting in the 1990s, Americans get this idea that if a kid is ever unsupervised, that kid will be snatched. And so we start hearing, not so much in the 90s, but in the early 2000s, we start hearing the first reports of parents who are arrested because their kid was found playing in a park and that\u2019s child endangerment. We have to, you know, are you a fit parent? And so, once that begins happening, Americans further their freakout and raise their kids in a paranoid, defensive way. And what we\u2019ve done to people, deprived kids of the main nutrient that they need to become adults, which is they have to have practice being autonomous. And we said, \u201cNo, no. No practice until you\u2019re 14 or 15.\u201d", "Jon, there\u2019s a lot of discussion around this kind of expectant millennial generation in the workforce that is, I would argue, expectant but also incredibly talented. What do you expect from or what will the impact be on corporate America as this sort of fragile generation, if you will, starts to enter the workforce?", "Yeah. So first we have to be very, very clear that the kids born in 1995 and after are ", "not", " millennials. So the last millennials graduated from college \u2014 I mean, those who are at least going for four years \u2014 they graduated from college around 2015, 2016. Everyone who\u2019s graduating after that is Gen Z, and they had a substantially different childhood. If you were born in 1996, you had a substantially different childhood than if you were born say in 1993, in that you got social media at a much younger age, you were more overprotected.", "So let\u2019s be very clear: Millennials are actually doing fine. Millennials are creative, they go out and start businesses. You know, every generation loves to rag on the one behind it, but when you look at the mental health stats, the millennials are doing fine. The next generation, Gen Z, is not. Gen Z, there\u2019s a really sharp spike around 2012/2013. If you look at all the data on teen mental health, you see that nothing is changing except for depression and anxiety, and those are going up very fast; going up in boys somewhat, and going up in girls much faster. And so the campus ... So this is what hit us on campus around 2013/2014, when Gen Z arrived on campus and brought their norms of safety-ism and fragility, and asked for more protection.", "Once they began graduating, getting hired, now in the last year, only in the last year, I\u2019m now ... Whenever I talk to someone in business ... Well, I very often hear a story like, \u201cYou know, we were in a sales meeting and somebody used a metaphor or told a joke, and next thing I know, there\u2019s a complaint to HR.\u201d And as one said to me, \u201cWe\u2019re all just exhausted from dealing with this stuff.\u201d It\u2019s like we have a job to do here and we\u2019re spending all our time policing speech and responding, how do we respond to ...", "And it\u2019s not, you know ... If it was obviously racist stuff, that would be one thing. But like one story was in a meeting, somebody said, \u201cYeah, but that would be like selling ice to Eskimos,\u201d and a recent college grad objected, and went to HR and complained. Now you might say is this an anti-Eskimo joke? But this is what call-out culture is all about; it\u2019s not about did you intend ... Did you say something bad about Eskimos, that they have a lot of ice up there? No, it\u2019s if you can possibly interpret someone else\u2019s words in the worst possible way, you should do so because that\u2019s how you get prestige points.", "And so this campus call-out culture, which is completely antithetical to cooperation ... I mean, people who do this, it\u2019s very hard to cooperate with them; you have to walk on eggshells around them. So it\u2019s gonna have a ... This is my prediction. I know you like predictions on this show. My prediction is that all the problems that we have on campus, the endless conflicts over words, and clothing, and food, these endless conflicts are coming to you in corporate America. Depends on the industry; I hear they\u2019re already there in journalism and tech actually, but I think they\u2019re gonna enter just about every industry. I mean, maybe not mining or something, but any industry that hires smart kids from the elite schools, especially in the northeast and west coast, is going to be importing this conflictual attitude.", "And what ... So I think we\u2019re already seeing it. We\u2019re already seeing that the moment you complain to HR, every complaint has to be taken very seriously, immediately; there\u2019s a general kind of gestalt where, all right, we have to investigate it and it can\u2019t be dismissed out of hand. In my sense is occasionally, it\u2019s probably appropriate to say, \u201cWell that\u2019s just stupid. Get back to work,\u201d and show that there are some boundaries around what qualifies as a complaint. And also to the extent that if someone is really brave coming forward, you create a supportive environment where they can reach out. But also to acknowledge, in certain instances, that someone ... You know, this isn\u2019t a valid complaint. ", "So you advised our headmaster; how would you advise managers in these companies as they start to see this rise in fragility?", "That\u2019s right. So yeah, so this is gonna be huge. And yeah, I should work up an inspiring speech and approach that leaders can give.", "So I think the key thing is, with all these conflicts, you always have to start by looking at what are they right about? What\u2019s the other side right about? And so I think a company where you just sort of say, \u201cCome on! Get thick skin,\u201d or \u201cGet back to work,\u201d you know, you might be masking some problems. And obviously with #MeToo and other things, there ", "are", " real problems; there are culture problems that have to be addressed. So I think the first step is a company has to show that it is serious about creating a welcoming, inclusive culture, that it\u2019s serious about cracking down on any displays of racism or sexism. So you can\u2019t just give a speech; you have to really show that your heart\u2019s in the right place and you\u2019re working on it.", "Once you do that, ", "then", " I think you can give a speech more along the lines that you are suggesting ... Something like, \u201cLook, we\u2019re all together here to do something, together. We think we have a great product, we think we serve our customers well. We\u2019re in a competitive environment and if we don\u2019t pull together and hold together, we\u2019re going down. So we gotta work as a team.\u201d And if you invoke a noble purpose, if you invoke encompassing identities, then I think within that, you can say okay, now how are we gonna resolve our disputes? There\u2019s going to be endless misunderstandings. We\u2019re human beings, for god sakes; we\u2019re always gonna make mistakes, we\u2019re gonna have slips of the tongue, we\u2019re gonna misinterpret each other\u2019s words. That\u2019s always gonna happen. So let\u2019s decide, how are we gonna do this? Are we going to initiate a bureaucratic procedure every time? If so, we\u2019re going down and we\u2019ll be out of business in a year or two. Or are we gonna try to give each other the benefit of the doubt and try to work this out?", "So I think the more a company has rigid bureaucratic procedures to handle grievances, the more it\u2019s gonna resemble a modern college campus; just with endless, endless bureaucracy. And as you know, in our bathrooms ... Have you noticed the signs in the bathrooms at Stern?", "Mm-hmm, yep.", "So yeah. It basically says if you see something, say something. We have a bias response team, and students are told, here are three ways you can report anyone who you think has shown bias, and the data ... I mean, what they\u2019re basically responding to, most of the cases are students reporting professors for something the professor has said in class. So you know, we\u2019re all teaching on eggshells, and I think the corporate world ... Obviously, you always have to be politic, you always have to be careful, but I think it\u2019s gonna get a lot worse.", "Yeah. Yeah, you\u2019d like to think universities would be a safe place where we\u2019d be a little bit more generous with each other, and if someone, in an attempt to be provocative or push the boundaries of your comfort zone around learning, that we\u2019d be generous with one another. And I find that that generosity is disappearing.", "Exactly. That\u2019s-", "It assigns ... Go ahead, Jon.", "And that\u2019s the heart of the problem. So as a professor, as an academic, we trace our lineage back to Socrates; he is our patron saint, and what did he do for a living? He provoked. That was the whole style. So you had ... He couldn\u2019t really do it in downtown Athens, and what they did was they were moved out to a grove of olive trees just outside of Athens, where they had different norms, and they created the kind of community in which people challenge each other. And out of those challenges and conflicts, the truth emerges. So that\u2019s our foundation myth, that\u2019s our origin story, and that\u2019s the way I experienced the academy until 2014. And 2014/2015, everything changed, and now I am not provocative, I don\u2019t tell jokes; you know, because I have to teach to the most sensitive student in the room. Not the average student, not the-", "100 percent.", "And that must be impossible for you. I don\u2019t know how you hold your tongue; your tongue seems to be on a very loose leash.", "Oh no. I\u2019m always five minutes away from losing my keys and being unceremoniously kicked out of NYU, because you can just see these kids ... They\u2019re actually ... So far, I\u2019ve been pretty lucky, and they\u2019re usually pretty generous with me. And I think a lot of it is ", "you", " walk in with a reputation for being thoughtful around these issues; I walk in with a reputation for not being thoughtful around these issues. So there\u2019s a bias that people who take my course are prepared to be a little bit offended.", "Well, that could be.", "But it is out of control, and the signs. You know, the signs have graduated from we\u2019re on the 9th floor at Stern, which is the top floor, and the sign on the door to the roof is, \u201cIf you are feeling depressed, please call this number.\u201d And I think that\u2019s a worthwhile sign, and now there\u2019s signs in the bathroom saying, \u201cIf something has bothered you, report it.\u201d I mean, pretty soon it\u2019s gonna be signs saying, \u201cIf you\u2019re having a bad day-\u201d", "If you\u2019re unhappy for any reason.", "Yeah, \u201cit\u2019s someone else\u2019s fault, and call this number.\u201d It feels kinda really over the top. So let\u2019s get back to corporate America. It feels as if ... You teach a lot about ethics in leadership, and focus on these issues, and how, the intersection between thought leadership and the corporate world. And I\u2019ve always thought, having spent the majority of my career in the private sector, that if you don\u2019t assign ... You know, what gets measured, what gets done, and someone has to be responsible for something. Who in a company is responsible for what you would call moral or ethical leadership? Is it the chairman of the board, is it the CEO? Because it seems like unless these things bubble up ... Who\u2019s responsible for framing these issues and making decisions around them?", "The CEO.", "The CEO.", "Yeah. The way leadership works psychologically ... You know, humans evolved in this interesting way, where we\u2019re a primate species so we\u2019re hierarchical, but yet we lived for a long time in hunter-gatherer groups that are very egalitarian. But then as soon as we get agriculture and surplus, we go right back to being hierarchical. So we\u2019re designed for hierarchy and we look to the leader to provide leadership, and especially to resolve conflicts; that\u2019s something that even chimpanzee leaders. And they\u2019re generally bullies and not good leaders, but they are expected to resolve certain kinds of conflicts. ", "So we don\u2019t look to the chairman of the board. We naturally look to the person who is in charge, and that generally is the CEO. And so if the tone at the top is not good, it\u2019s almost impossible to improve things elsewhere. It\u2019s very difficult. Tone at the top is not sufficient; people are as much or more affected by what those around them are doing. But you have to try to get alignment between the messages and the actions given by those at the top, those in the middle, those all around you.", "So I co-founded a site called EthicalSystems.org, and the idea was there\u2019s all this research out there on how you can improve your ethical culture, but it\u2019s scattered across like all these different disciplines, and I didn\u2019t know it when I came to Stern, even though I study morality. So if listeners go to EthicalSystems.org, we have a lot of advice there for how to measure your ethical culture. We\u2019re especially working on a speak-up culture project; how do you measure who is afraid to speak up about what and why? And there are huge generational differences. You know, older people will kind of assume, \u201cWell, if people have a problem, they\u2019re gonna come tell me,\u201d and younger people are saying, \u201cNo way, I\u2019m not doing that.\u201d", "So the executive, the leader, the CEO, is responsible for putting out inspiring message, for making clear that he or she cares about ethics; rewarding for it, hiring and firing and promoting for it. So there\u2019s a lot that you can do, but it\u2019s gotten a lot trickier in the last couple of years because of the spectacular collapse of trust due to the call-out culture enabled by social media.", "So what do you do if it\u2019s ... Let\u2019s just take an example, Facebook. I\u2019m curious to get your viewpoint on this. It feels like there was negligence in terms of not putting in place the safeguards to ensure this platform wasn\u2019t weaponized, a lot of evidence showing that the product they put out results in teen depression, our elections may have been contaminated. And the CEO sets a tone, but the CEO, a lot of people would argue, can\u2019t be removed from office. Does the responsibility fall to someone else, shareholders or us as voters, to put in place people who can regulate these companies? Because it seems as if in tech right now, there\u2019s a lot of what could loosely be deemed unethical behavior. ", "What\u2019s your viewpoint? How do we address the problems that Facebook ... You\u2019re saying it\u2019s the CEO.", "Well, I am saying that the CEO has the ultimate ... He\u2019s the point person-", "Sets the tone.", "... who sets the tone. That\u2019s what I said. Now if the CEO is being unethical, irresponsible, then I think it is the board\u2019s job. Typically, as in the case of Zuckerberg, he didn\u2019t do anything illegal; it\u2019s not so clear that there are grounds for removing him. But Facebook, I think, has changed so rapidly and has become so powerful, they really have to do a deep reckoning, and I\u2019m not sure how that\u2019s gonna come about. I\u2019ve spoken there a few times, I know a few Facebook employees. I think it\u2019s a company full of good people, full of idealistic people, and this is one of the basic things about business ethics: Bad things happen not so much because of bad people, necessarily, but because systems are in place that allow things to happen that, in retrospect, are terrible.", "So one example is I nearly deleted my Facebook account. There\u2019s this steady drip of problems, but when I read that New York Times thing a few months ago that the phone number that I had provided for two- step verification, that those phone numbers are now part of the network of information, I felt so betrayed. And I asked a friend who was a former employee, and he said well, nobody set out to do that; that certainly wasn\u2019t ... The goal wasn\u2019t to do that, but you know, we\u2019re trying to grow the network as fast as we can. We have to make it ... The bigger it gets, the more valuable it gets, exponentially. And so once the information was in there, it just somehow kinda got pulled in.", "And so I think an important point about Facebook is that it now has so much power and is doing so many things that if its employees aren\u2019t all looking out for problems, then problems are gonna just keep growing and multiplying. And so you have to have a speak-up culture; you have to have a culture where people feel that they have the good of the company at heart, they want the company to be successful, and if they see a potential problem, they\u2019re gonna say something. I just read something, I can\u2019t remember where it was, a few days ago, about some science that there is not such a culture at Facebook, or that employees are afraid to speak up.", "So I think Facebook has to do ... Like most big companies, they have to do a lot more to encourage employees to feel secure speaking up. I think an ombudsperson ... The research seems to show that having an ombudsperson is generally very helpful. That person can resolve problems more informally, often. So I don\u2019t know enough about Facebook to give very specific advice, but you have to have a culture in which everyone is looking out for problems and has a way to bring them up.", "Yeah Jon, so the general reputation of Facebook is they\u2019re incredibly, and this is Kara\u2019s word, \u201cdocile\u201d whereas Google has very much that speak-up culture. Just real quickly, another what I would argue is sort of an ethical lapse was this kinda shitshow con, not contest, of HQ2, where it feels to me in retrospect that there\u2019s a lot of evidence that this was never really a contest; that the cake was baked, the game was over, and this was just an elegant transfer of wealth from municipalities to the shareholders of Amazon. What\u2019s your take on that and who ... You know, do you think this is what you would describe as an ethical lapse, and how do we, as shareholders and as citizens, push back on a firm like Amazon? And is push back required, or are they just doing their job?", "Yeah. Well I\u2019m very influenced by Richard Florida here, I know that you\u2019ve spoken with him, and he was ", "very", " upset about this. He could see it coming. You know, he could see what Amazon was doing, and playing cities off each other to force them into a race to the bottom to make more concessions of taxpayer money. So yes, it was very manipulative; I think clearly it was a strategy to gain various advantages. It wasn\u2019t a sincere quest, I don\u2019t think.", "And was that ethically wrong? Well, from society\u2019s perspective, yes. Part of what happened to American capitalism in the 1970s was we had some clear ideas laid out about how the ethical responsibility, the fiduciary duty, the duties of executives and leaders, are to the shareholders; maximize shareholder value. And so as that idea of shareholder primacy took hold in the \u201870s, the idea ... And I see it in some of our MBA students, I\u2019m sure you see it too. The idea is that there\u2019s only one stakeholder that matters, and that is the shareholders, and to the extent that you ever care about employees or even customers, it\u2019s ", "only", " to the extent that doing so will increase shareholder value.", "That\u2019s a terrible way to think about business. It\u2019s not the way that it\u2019s thought about everywhere in the world, it\u2019s not the way that America used to think about it, necessarily. It might lead to more dynamism and I can\u2019t say that it\u2019s absolutely terrible overall, but I think that a stakeholder view ... This is what we\u2019re trying to teach in many business schools. Taking the stakeholder view, just telling people, look, good business means managing a lot of different relationships; you gotta keep your eye on all of them. And if you focus too much on the shareholders, you\u2019re gonna end up doing some bad things.", "So was Amazon doing the right thing? Well, you know, for its shareholders, it probably was. And so unless we get either more regulation or new norms that businesses have social responsibilities, we\u2019re going to keep getting this. And of course that\u2019s what Larry Fink\u2019s letter to investors last January was, was ... I don\u2019t know what came of it, I don\u2019t know whether businesses are listening, but the idea that we have to start judging businesses more by their social effect. It\u2019s the longest-running debate in business ethics, and I think a new chapter just opened up this year.", "So let\u2019s talk a little bit about winners and losers, and I\u2019ll ask you if you think that Apple is a winner? It seems to me that Apple has been very effective at starching their hat white in 2018, and trying to separate themselves from the rest of big tech and say that privacy is a basic human right. What are your observations on kinda Tim Cook\u2019s indignance tour, and basically trying to say, we\u2019re the good guys?", "So as a father who has been working on this for a couple years and trying to figure out, how do I put healthy limits on my kids without being too intrusive, I gotta say, the Apple controls work pretty well. And so I think Apple has responded. You know, they were taking some heat last year, I don\u2019t know how long these were in the works, but I think Facebook emerges as the one that has more ethical problems coming up. And Apple, as far as I know, has had fewer. So I think they are at least taking seriously this issue of tech addiction and the mental health effects that it may have.", "So loser Facebook, winner Apple. Any other winners and losers from the world of tech that you would think are doing an especially good or bad job trying to address these issues?", "Oh, let\u2019s see. I guess I don\u2019t know ... Yeah, I don\u2019t know the insides of the tech companies well enough to say. I\u2019ll leave that to you. What do you think?", "I think you summarized it. I think Apple, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s ... I mean, Tim Cook\u2019s sudden concern over privacy is similar to, if Larry and Sergey suddenly became very worried about device addiction; it\u2019s awfully convenient for him because he\u2019s basically sticking his finger on the soft tissue of companies that traffic in data, specifically Google and Facebook. So I think it\u2019s ... I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s not principled, but it is awfully convenient. And Google has had this incredible heat shield in the form of Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, who are arguably kinda the most photoshopped images in the history of business, and they have just been the bad guys here. And I think it\u2019s probably only gonna get worse.", "So as a dad, as a professor, what are the one or two things you\u2019re most optimistic about and most concerned about? And I\u2019ll broaden it up from technology to the world of politics that we\u2019re living in now; what you see in terms of our youth and ... You know, we\u2019re what I call one of the 15 top 10 business schools in America, arguably producing the leaders of tomorrow. If you were to ... Let\u2019s talk about predictions. If you were to try and predict one or two kind of real issues, concerning issues, over the next 10 years across everything you look at, what would those one or two things be, Jon?", "Well I think the number one thing is the mental health crisis of teenagers; the skyrocketing rates of anxiety, depression, self-harm, and suicide, which are especially affecting girls. The data wasn\u2019t so clear in 2015, when I was writing my article with Lukianoff, and now it\u2019s really clear. So I think we\u2019re gonna see, in the next year or two, a national reckoning ... And this is happening in Britain too, they have the same things. Canada, too. We\u2019re gonna see a national reckoning with the fact that we are in danger of losing a generation; that we\u2019re gonna the generation after the millennials, is gonna be much fearful, much less able to face risk. It\u2019s gonna impact the business world, it\u2019s gonna impact innovation.", "So I think the next year or two is gonna see a major reckoning with this, and a recognition that you know what, sometimes good intentions produce bad outcomes and we\u2019ve been overprotecting kids. So I think we\u2019re gonna make some big changes in how we raise and educate kids.", "The other thing that I\u2019m very encouraged about is we didn\u2019t really talk about identity politics here. There are two forms of identity politics: There\u2019s kind of a nasty common enemy identity politics where you say, you know, it\u2019s all the fault of the oppressive groups and the victims are the good people. And that\u2019s what we have mostly on campus, is this common enemy; everybody\u2019s supposed to unite against the straight white men who are the evil oppressors. And that can never lead to progress, inclusion, harmony, trust. That\u2019s the road to endless conflict.", "But what\u2019s encouraging to me is that just in the last year, and I think it\u2019s because as we\u2019ve seen right-wing racial identity politics and we\u2019ve seen white supremacy, and Nazis, and things like that, I think that\u2019s encouraged a lot of scholars who are not white men ... There are a lot of black, and Muslim, and LGBT professors who are suddenly saying, \u201cWow, we\u2019ve gotta stop doing this. This is not the way to promote harmony and inclusion.\u201d And so Amy Chua writing about political tribes, Francis Fukuyama about identity, Anthony Appiah. There\u2019s a whole bunch of really good books out in the last year or two.", "So I\u2019m optimistic that we\u2019re gonna break out of this sort of death spiral of mutual hatred and pitting groups against each other, and we\u2019re gonna try to use some more psychologically sophisticated and morally uplifting ways, more in the form of Martin Luther King, and many of the early civil rights leaders, we call this common humanity identity politics.", "I\u2019m optimistic that things are getting so bad, on campus at least, they\u2019re so bad that there\u2019s a rise in recognition that we got to change course.", "Wow, you\u2019re the optimist.
