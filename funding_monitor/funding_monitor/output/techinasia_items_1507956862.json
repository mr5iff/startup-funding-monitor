[\u2026] Some people need to take care of their families, and flexible working situations are not just a choice but also a necessity for them. [\u2026] And the new generation demands\u00a0a more flexible work lifestyle.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>But the system remains imperfect until now, as greater access to work and career opportunities comes with several drawbacks.</p>\n<p>For one, outsourcing platforms tend to charge high fees on both ends of the transaction. Also, veteran freelancers can push themselves to the forefront without real merit, thanks to unbalanced systems, making it harder for new entrants to stand out and win contracts.</p>\n<p>However, the blockchain technology and some companies that take advantage of the infrastructure\u2019s decentralized nature could change that reality for the better.</p>\n<h2><strong>A blockchain-based freelancing platform </strong></h2>\n<p>Australian startup\u00a0<a href=\"https://canya.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">CanYa</a> has created a platform that seeks to eliminate middlemen and many persisting issues facing greater freelancing adoption. The company offers freelancers and service seekers a simplified platform that highlights transparency and fairness.</p>\n<p>CanYa provides a peer-to-peer network that eliminates broker platforms and lets service providers interface directly with their clients. One of the biggest benefits for users is the automation of the ranking system, which doesn\u2019t reward those\u00a0with higher customer ratings. The non-merit-based system\u00a0closes loopholes that savvy users could exploit to increase their visibility at the expense of others.</p>\n<p>The company also offers a new payment system based on their cryptocurrency called CanYa Tokens or CAN. Service providers can handle all their transactions with CAN. The currency can be easily exchanged into other major cryptos such as bitcoin, ether, and even fiat currencies\u2014free of fees.</p>\n<p>CanYa is looking to grow, launching a token presale and ICO in the near future to meet their ambitions for expansion.</p>\n<h2><strong>Possible benefits to Asia<br></strong></h2>\n<p>Despite issues associated with existing platforms, <a href=\"https://asiafoundation.org/2014/07/09/online-work-the-game-changer-for-asias-entrepreneurs/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Asian countries</a> such as India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan still make up a sizable portion of the overall freelancing economy. Hence, they are uniquely positioned to take advantage of an ecosystem such as CanYa for their contracting needs.</p>\n<p>With end-to-end service, platforms like CanYa could simplify the way many external contractors in Asia seek work and receive payments. They can also empower service providers to take control of their workflow and earn money based on their potential. They are also not limited to tech-related industries, as providers can advertise anything from highly specialized jobs to per-hour services, making it easier for freelancers to participate and benefit.</p>\n<p>As the flaws of existing freelancing platforms become more obvious to Asian service providers, blockchain-based alternatives spell potential growth that will benefit all participants.</p>\n<h2><b>Apparent competition</b></h2>\n<p>CanYa displays immense potential. However, some hurdles stand in the way for wider adoption. While the company has built an intriguing model designed to disrupt online outsourcing, it must still compete with giants like Upwork and Freelancer, which already command a large percentage of the total market share. These companies have ample resources at their disposal to implement a similar system as CanYa should they choose to pivot and embrace blockchain.</p>\n<p>Moreover, some companies like <a href=\"https://www.coinlancer.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Coinlancer</a> have started offering similar services based on blockchain and compete directly with CanYa. To be effective, the Melbourne-based startup will need to spread the message quickly and encourage adoption to draw away market share from established competitors.</p>", "spider_name": "techinasia", "id": "techinasia_433882", "has_funding_news": 0.44095370173454285}

Finally, I\u2019m ready to put the lid on the tube and slide it into an envelope that comes with the test kit.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s my first personal DNA test, and I\u2019m doing it with Singapore startup <a href=\"https://www.imagenelabs.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Imagene Labs</a>.</p>\n<p>Once the startup has analyzed my genetic code \u2013 it takes two to three weeks \u2013 I will receive personalized wellness recommendations: What foods to avoid, what products are good for my skin, and how I should exercise.</p>\n<p>\u201cPrecision wellness\u201d is how Imagene Labs director Jia Yi Har describes her work.</p>\n<p>Personal DNA tests became popular in the US with companies like 23andMe and Ancestry.com, who tell you about your genetic heritage. The results are mostly fun discoveries \u2013 perhaps you have an unexpected strand of Native American ancestry in your family tree.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/N06g2kc1Dxo\" width=\"750\" height=\"420\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>Imagene Labs takes it further. Its main product, Ori, is a DNA testing platform and subscription business in one. Once Ori knows the genetic properties of your skin, digestive tract, and muscle tissue, it concocts tailor-made products that you can have shipped to your home.</p>\n<p>The skin serum comes in a slender white bottle with your name on it. This stuff is made to perfectly balance your skin type.</p>\n<p>Then there\u2019s a food supplement, a mixture of granules in different shades of green. It contains nutrients and vitamins which your body tends to lack due to genetic predispositions, all in the right percentage.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe exercise you have to do yourself,\u201d says Reza Harith, who joined Imagene\u2019s team after working as a brand manager at a fitness studio chain.</p>\n<p>The Ori results come with exercise recommendations, put together by fitness experts based on what your DNA says about your muscle growth capacity, metabolism, and other factors.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_434597\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-434597\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/imagene-labs-ori-products-750x563.jpg\" alt=\"imagene-labs-ori-products\" width=\"750\" height=\"563\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ori\u2019s products: A skin care serum and food supplement.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Price drop</h2>\n<p>Creating DNA-based products and services became possible because the cost of DNA sequencing has gone down, Har explains.</p>\n<p>The Human Genome Project, the first effort to fully identify and map human DNA, was completed in 2003 after more than a decade of research that cost billions of dollars. \u201cIt only costs about US$1,000 and takes considerably less time now,\u201d says Har. \u201cEverything about the process, the sequencing itself, the chemicals used, the processing power required, all of this has improved, resulting in the price drop.\u201d</p>\n<p>Another key innovation startups like Imagene Labs rely on is <a href=\"https://www.illumina.com/techniques/sequencing/dna-sequencing.html\" target=\"_blank\">Illumina</a>. The process allows researchers to isolate specific locations in the genetic code. These are called SNPS \u2013 pronounced snips.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe know which particular locations are proven to contribute to the traits we are interested in,\u201d Har says. Imagene includes only those snips in its analysis that have \u201cthousands of published scientific studies\u201d backing up their correlation with certain traits.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_210077\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-210077\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/NIPT-testing-startup-Prenetics-720x480.jpg\" alt=\"DNA-testing startup\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/snre/\" target=\"_blank\"> University of Michigan School of Natural Resources &amp; Environment</a></p>\n</div>\n<p>To make that more concrete: One of the genes tested in Ori\u2019s fitness analysis is called IGF2. It\u2019s proven to be associated with muscle soreness. My particular variation of this gene puts me into \u201c90th percentile\u201d of the average population \u2013 in other words, I have a higher than average likelihood of feeling sore after exercise.</p>\n<p>With Illumina, Imagene can focus on pre-selected snips. This doesn\u2019t only make it faster, it also helps avoid ethical and legal complications \u2013 if a startup had your full genome, it could potentially also know about critical diseases.</p>\n<p>Using DNA for medical diagnostics is its own discipline with a slew of regulations, explains Har.</p>\n<p>Imagene\u2019s parent company, Asia Genomics, is in this business. It runs medical diagnostics like prenatal tests, which look for abnormalities in babies before they are born. They are distributed through clinics and administered by professionals. Everything needs to be certified.</p>\n<p>Focusing on wellness means Imagene Labs isn\u2019t bound by the same requirements. Its association with Asia Genomics gives it a huge leg up\u00a0because it can share the parent firm\u2019s professional lab facilities and team resources.</p>\n<p>Asia Genomics has so far raised US$12 million from investors like Formation 8, Raffles Venture Partners, Spring Seeds, and some angel investors, Har says.</p>\n<h2>Extreme personalization</h2>\n<p>Asia Genomics started in 2014, and Imagine Labs spun out in 2016 as an attempt to spark consumer interest in DNA-based personalization.</p>\n<p>Ori was first available in Singapore, then in Malaysia, Thailand, Hong Kong, and Jakarta. There\u2019s also a second full lab in Beijing.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_434595\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-large wp-image-434595\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/imagene-labs-ori-team-750x563.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"563\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Imagene Labs team. <i>Tech in Asia spoke with director Jia Yi Har (3rd from right) and marketing manager Reza Harith (2nd from right).</i></p>\n</div>\n<p>Asia is a good place to start with these products because people are generally willing to experiment when it comes to wellness and beauty, Harith says. He is establishing relationships with spas and fitness centers as distribution channels for Ori.</p>\n<p>\u201cIntravenous vitamin drips, chemical peels, and fillers \u2013 in Thailand and Malaysia, it\u2019s common to try these,\u201d he says. While Singaporeans tend to be more skeptical about new trends, they do often get on board later once fringe trends trickle into the country from its neighbors.</p>\n<p>Even though DNA sequencing prices have gone down, Ori is still an investment many will think about twice. Just one of the tests, the skin test, costs US$184. This comes with a 30-day supply of your personalized facial serum. After it\u2019s done, you can get a new bottle for US$89.</p>\n<p>The number of tests run since Ori\u2019s launch in 2016 is \u201cin the thousands,\u201d Har says. There\u2019s not been a clinical trial on the effectiveness of recommendations and products provided, but client feedback, she adds, has been encouraging.</p>\n<p>Imagene Labs is at the cutting edge of the DNA personalization trend. Only a few other startups, mostly US-based, are exploring the opportunities.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s <a href=\"https://habit.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Habit</a>, which combines DNA analysis with a subscription-based food delivery program, and <a href=\"https://www.dnafit.com/\" target=\"_blank\">DNAFit</a>, which is similar to Imagene Labs\u2019 Fitness component.</p>\n<p>Science is not yet convinced that DNA-based fitness and wellness has massive benefits over regular practices.</p>\n<p>An <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/11/2/13453434/personalized-diet-nutrition-dna\" target=\"_blank\">article</a> by <em>Vox</em> quotes John Mathers, the director of the Human Nutrition Research Center at Newcastle University, on his interpretation of Habit\u2019s product. His group had done research comparing different types of personalized dietary advice to a control group.</p>\n<p>Those that received personalized advice did perform better, but \u201cthere was no evidence that including phenotypic and phenotypic plus genotypic information enhanced the effectiveness of the [personalized nutrition] advice,\u201d Mathers said.</p>\n<p>In other words, DNA-based personalization was not doing significantly better than other forms of personalized advice.</p>\n<h2>No going back</h2>\n<p>But with falling costs and fast-developing tech, Har believes it\u2019s only a matter of time until there are products that make the jump from the fringe to the mainstream.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s no going back,\u201d she says. \u201cPrecision medicine has started. President Obama set up an initiative in the US to sequence the population, looking for insights that help lower healthcare costs. Other countries are following suit.\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s the medical side, she points out. \u201cThe wellness market is actually three times larger than the medical market.\u201d</p>\n<p>Consumers in Asia spend massive amounts on beauty products. Ori\u2019s skin serum is so far its best-selling product.</p>\n<p>The Asia-Pacific beauty and healthcare market amounted to US$98.5 billion in 2015 and will grow to around US$127 billion by 2020, according to <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/550547/cosmetic-market-size-asia-pacific/\" target=\"_blank\">Statista</a>. Globally, Asia Pacific makes up the largest share of the market.</p>\n<p>The cosmetics industry is in constant need to innovate, Har says. This has led to an\u00a0immense variety of ingredients, design, and marketing messages. And according to Har, beauty brands have been watching Imagene Lab\u2019s work with great interest.</p>\n<p>As for my Ori test results, I found many interesting recommendations that often matched what I already knew about myself. The most helpful advice, perhaps, was in the nutrition analysis, which found a high genetic predisposition for COQ10 deficiency \u2013 a coenzyme that provides energy to cells for growth and maintenance. Instead of buying Ori\u2019s own supplement mix, I chose to get my own and follow the dietary recommendations. Which in my case, means adding plenty of liver and kidney to my diet.

Photo credit: Park N Parcel.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Online shopping is quickly turning into a favorite hobby for many people in Singapore these days \u2013 73 percent of adult Singaporean internet users shopped online in 2016 and spent close to US$2.2 billion in online purchases according to <a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/stories/sea/singaporeans-mobile-commerce-expenditure-expected-to-surge\" target=\"_blank\">a study by PayPal</a>. Several startups that deal with logistics and package delivery have jumped on the opportunity.</p>\n<p>Singapore\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.parknparcel.com.sg/\" target=\"_blank\">Park N Parcel</a> falls into the latter category and it\u2019s going all sharing economy on the problem of missing your delivery.</p>\n<p>In busy Singapore, people miss a ton of deliveries because they\u2019re not at home when their package arrives. That\u2019s how Bryan See Toh, co-founder and CEO of Park N Parcel, first came up with the idea for the startup. His fiancee, a flight attendant, had deliveries constantly diverted to her aunt\u2019s place where she could pick them up whenever she was back home.</p>\n<p>Together with co-founders and longtime co-workers Erik Cheong and Tan Gan Hong, he decided to give everyone an \u201caunt\u201d who could pick up deliveries for them.</p>\n<h2>A parking spot for your parcel</h2>\n<p>Shoppers find available \u201cparkers\u201d (as Park N Parcel calls them) on the startup\u2019s website, where they\u2019re displayed after a multi-step vetting process. Once matched with a parker that\u2019s closest to them, they can use their details as the shipping address on their online order. When the parker receives the item, the shopper is notified and can then go and pick it up.</p>\n<p>The shopper pays an extra fee (around US$1.80) to get access to the service. Parkers get a cut of that fee for their participation, and a review system helps spot any parkers who aren\u2019t helpful. Park N Parcel has received more than 6,000 applications from aspiring parkers across Singapore since starting out in January, but has only approved 1,200 of them, mostly in residential addresses.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">Park N Parcel decided to give everyone an \u2018aunt\u2019 who could pick up deliveries for them.</blockquote>\n<p>Cheong estimates that on average, a parker receives 10 parcels per month. The actual number depends on their location \u2013 if a parker is located close to a hub, like a train station, they can receive up to a hundred parcels per month while others may receive only a few, he says.</p>\n<p>The solution of drop-off locations for parcels isn\u2019t new. Singaporean logistics startup <a href=\"https://www.ninjavan.co\" target=\"_blank\">Ninja Van</a>, for example, has Ninja Collect \u2013 a service delivering items to either partner businesses that act as recipients for deliveries, or drop-off lockers. SingPost has its own lockers called POPStations, where people can pick up their parcels at their convenience.</p>\n<p>Cheong feels Park N Parcel\u2019s solution has a place in the market nonetheless. For one, it gives users a drop-off point no farther than 1 kilometer from where they are, while lockers tend to be around 2.5km  away. The startup also believes this fosters a sense of community between people who live close by.</p>\n<p>The team is now rolling out an additional service called Park N Deliver, which helps users send items from one point to another using on-demand drivers. The aim is to serve small businesses or individuals that sell online.</p>\n<p>To gain more momentum, Park N Parcel is exploring partnerships with small and medium-sized logistics companies as well as ecommerce platforms.</p>\n<p>The former face problems like no access to drop-off lockers, limited resources, and high costs of re-delivering parcels, according to Cheong. For the latter, an additional option for delivery doesn\u2019t hurt their business.

When I really needed to find a way out, I heard about ecommerce and drop shipping.</p>\n<p id=\"54de\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I decided to quit the job I had for only a month and focus on building my own online store with my friend, Nick, who was then living in Paris. What I loved the most about this type of business was:</p>\n<ul class=\"postList\">\n<li id=\"1d51\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">Managing everything remotely</li>\n<li id=\"d9a1\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Learning things that would always be useful afterward</li>\n<li id=\"8444\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Being able to exit the rat race I was in back then</li>\n</ul>\n<p id=\"6af5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">I have shared the complete story <a href=\"https://thomasdespin.com/6-months-from-homeless-in-debt-to-1-100-a-day-158aabe19423\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://thomasdespin.com/100k-per-month-3-things-we-fucked-up-bd9356255922\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, so feel free to read them if you want to.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1ffb\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf--leading\"><strong>The 3 most valuable things I\u2019ve learned</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"ebab\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Making money is one thing, but what we learn and who we become by doing so matters way more.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Starting the business was quite intense and steep in the beginning. Yet, the three most valuable things I\u2019ve learned are not about the business itself but more about the mindset I developed.</p>\n<h3 id=\"eb67\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\"><strong>1. I made money, and I can do it again</strong></h3>\n<p>It would often take you months or years to try to do something new. But once you\u2019re in it, it\u2019ll be easier next time. It\u2019s the same with doing business.</p>\n<p id=\"3e53\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I discovered that it\u2019s possible to make money by myself at a scale I never experienced before. I also discovered that other people who make money weren\u2019t that different from me, as they just do things that bring them results.</p>\n<p id=\"3943\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I started from zero and reached US$750,000 in sales within almost a year. I did something I had no clue of and started taking action. I unlocked something in my brain that made me realize, \u201cF*ck. It\u2019s actually possible!\u201d</p>\n<p>I opened my mind wider, connected with people who produce the same (or bigger) figures, and considered more opportunities. Then, I realized I can do it again. I can do way better in the future.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1f0c\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\"><strong>2. Hustling is overrated</strong></h3>\n<p id=\"8139\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">I\u2019m a big fan of serial entrepreneur\u00a0<a class=\"markup--user markup--p-user\" href=\"https://medium.com/@garyvee\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"https://medium.com/@garyvee\" data-anchor-type=\"2\" data-user-id=\"c4ec9163657c\" data-action-value=\"c4ec9163657c\" data-action=\"show-user-card\" data-action-type=\"hover\">Gary Vaynerchuk</a>, and I love his messages about hustling. But I only watch five minutes of his videos when I need an extra boost of motivation to get something done.</p>\n<p id=\"8630\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Eventually, this all-in thing about hustling hard and working 10 days a week/50 hours a day is the dumbest thing to do once you start \u201cmaking it.\u201d Once the business is running (aka profitable), you need to work smarter and not harder. There are millions of ways to be busy, working on several things for the business. But it doesn\u2019t mean that you should do all of them.</p>\n<p id=\"8290\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">At some point, the business will need more vision, and the execution might need to be outsourced. The business will need to be led by someone who can work smarter, not longer.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Clarity and quality over quantity\u2014I totally missed this point in the past 11 months.</p>\n<h3 id=\"77fa\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\"><strong>3. Being wrong is not fine, it\u2019s necessary</strong></h3>\n<p id=\"565d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">In this kind of business, it\u2019s all about testing. You test products, audiences, and new methods. There are some basic principles that are sensible to follow. But in some cases, the more you test, the more results you get. The more you learn from those results, the more you understand what works.</p>\n<p>And since you can be wrong most of the time, your mistakes can give you the most interesting insights. They can give you more data which can lead you to make better decisions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"daf4\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf--leading\"><strong>So, why did I\u00a0stop?</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"29b5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">The first lines of this article aren\u2019t the reasons why I decided to stop. They are triggers, and it\u2019s important to notice the difference. The triggers were just activating the deeper reasons of why I stopped.</p>\n<h3 id=\"d239\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\"><strong>\u201cI don\u2019t feel like we add any\u00a0value.\u201d</strong></h3>\n<p id=\"b23a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">This is what my store manager told me when he resigned\u2014and he was right. Knowing that the customers had access to AliExpress themselves and could get the same products from the same suppliers, there was no reason for them to pay three times more going to our store.</p>\n<p id=\"af21\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Yes, we did the marketing part, pushing the product in front of them while they were on Facebook. But this was a very poor idea in my opinion. We basically marked up a product anyone could find, shipped it slower than the major ecommerce players could, and we called it a business.</p>\n<p id=\"18ef\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Of course, there are many ways we could\u2019ve added value. We could\u2019ve done away with the 3x markup, found products elsewhere outside of AliExpress, used a warehouse in the country we\u2019re selling in to ship faster, or made our own brand (which in this business requires just sticking your logo on the product and still add zero value).</p>\n<p>But the real value I think we could\u2019ve added was creating the products ourselves and marketing them.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cb3e\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\"><strong>The business itself is quite boring</strong></h3>\n<p id=\"136f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Most of the drop shippers I know are spending their days alone in front of their laptop, trying to lower their cost per conversion, increase the website conversion rate, or find the latest and trending products.</p>\n<p id=\"2a93\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Of course, we have our independence, something I\u2019ve always valued. But at the end of the day, we just spend our time buying cheap products and selling them expensively. This is probably the most basic form of trading, and it\u2019s cool to be able to do it online. But it\u2019s not like we are innovating, solving any problem, or making people happier.</p>\n<p id=\"44b2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">However, the exciting part of all of this for me was learning the tools, knowledge, and concepts I didn\u2019t know before. All these skills are now part of me and I can use them again for something more meaningful.</p>\n<h3 id=\"d958\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\"><strong>A more exciting, long-term opportunity showed\u00a0up</strong></h3>\n<p id=\"74ca\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">A few months ago, the company I worked for a year ago contacted me. They offered me to work with them again, but not as an employee. They wanted me to be a partner.</p>\n<p id=\"7cb2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The company is a digital agency initially focused on creating websites, web design, and SEO. Now, they are growing fast, diversifying toward Facebook marketing, influencer marketing, and in-house \u201cstartup\u201d projects. They are based in Bali, and I intend to keep living in Indonesia for the coming years.</p>\n<p id=\"d53e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Also, the Indonesian market is growing like crazy and is still way undervalued by many, which leaves a huge spot for a digital agency like this one to flourish. I also think I\u2019ll learn many new things with them. Closing my online store would give me more time on helping this company grow.</p>\n<h2><strong>All part of the adventure</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"5a77\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf--leading\">Closing a business is often seen as a bad or sad\u00a0thing. In our situation, the only regret I have is seeing some people who worked with us end up jobless.\u00a0After working for months with these people, it\u2019s hard to leave them (by the way, if you are looking for a talented and experienced graphic designer or a French-speaking customer service rep, let me know).</p>\n<p id=\"1cdc\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">But all of this is part of the adventure. And when we embrace the benefits, we also have to embrace the risks.</p>\n<p id=\"3fa4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This experience takes time to learn from, accept, and process. But I am confident that tomorrow, the lessons learned today will help build more meaningful and impactful businesses.</p>\n<p><em>This article was first published on <a href=\"https://thecoffeelicious.com/11-months-and-750-000-later-i-decided-to-close-my-drop-shipping-business-heres-why-e4d96eb5cb83\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Medium</a>.</em></p>", "spider_name": "techinasia", "id": "techinasia_434336", "has_funding_news": 0.44546574354171753}

Photo credit: Springboard.</p>\n</div>\n<p>\u201cWe have not been flashy and all over the place. We have been quietly building. Now, we are in a good place and turned profitable months ago.\u201d</p>\n<p>A tiny \u201cwow\u201d escaped my lips when I heard Parul Gupta, co-founder of <a href=\"https://www.springboard.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Springboard</a>, say this as I don\u2019t know many startups in the online learning space who could make this claim. And it was just a little over a year-and-a-half since the edtech startup on a mission to \u201chelp millennials advance their careers through self-paced, mentored courses\u201d announced its seed funding round of US$1.7 million.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe hit US$6 million in annualized revenues and are growing. We have had students from 70 countries now. But almost 75 to 80 percent of them are from the US and Canada,\u201d Gupta adds.</p>\n<p>Changing the way people learn through technology has been a long time coming and not yet arrived. That\u2019s because it needs a shift in perspective for all stakeholders \u2013 teachers, students, parents, and others in the education space. It\u2019s not easy, as many edtech startups that plunged into online learning discovered.</p>\n<p>Despite US$15 million in funding and a seven-year run, for example, iProf never found a sustainable model and had to shut down. There have been others like Purple Squirrel who burned through millions in funding without ever finding the elusive keys to monetization and profitability in edtech. Carnegie Mellon University engineer Shabnam Aggarwal <a href=\"http://techcircle.vccircle.com/2016/12/30/ed-tech-startup-kleverkid-winds-up-operations/\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> after closing Kleverkid that she \u201ccame up short\u201d when she tried to answer the question why it was \u201cnot making enough money fast enough.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">Having a price point which actually factored in what we paid our mentors and our operational and marketing costs made sure that we proved the right market.</blockquote>\n<p>So what worked for Springboard?</p>\n<p>One of the most important decisions Gupta and co-founder Gautam Tambay took in the early days of their startup was to charge their users. In December 2014, they came up with their first paid learning programs. One course was priced at US$300 a month, and another at US$400.</p>\n<p>\u201cHaving a price point which actually factored in what we paid our mentors and a reasonable fraction of our operational and marketing costs made sure that we proved the right market. You could heavily subsidize it and sell those at US$100 to begin with but later when you actually raise the price to US$400, you might find that there are no takers for it,\u201d Gupta explains.</p>\n<p>If they had launched the courses at a much lower price, they might have signed up more students and miscalculated the market to be much larger. Remember this was in the time of \u2018irrational exuberance\u2019 in 2014 and 2015. \u201cWe might have gone down the wrong path, building something which wasn\u2019t viable,\u201d Gupta says.</p>\n<p>\u201cInstead, we proved that there are people who are willing to buy this offering at the pricing where we can be economically viable.\u201d</p>\n<p>A lot of consumer-facing startups in India went on a customer acquisition spree and made the mistake of luring in users with discounts. \u201cWhile the discounts lasted, consumers flocked to them. But when they rolled back the discounts, people became less interested in buying those offerings or shifted to other platforms which were offering discounts,\u201d Gupta says.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_434172\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Springboard-team.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1181\" height=\"579\" class=\"size-full wp-image-434172\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Springboard team. Photo credit: Springboard.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>The triple play</h2>\n<p>Gupta says Springboard got three things right after a few iterations: the verticals it launched courses in, its one-on-one mentoring model, and the community it built \u2013 both alumni and mentor networks. She elaborates on what worked for Springboard:</p>\n<p>1) \u201cIdentify a real pain-point. Yeah, I think that\u2019s the main thing,\u201d Gupta takes a minute to think about my question before saying this. \u201cSpot the right area to launch a product. Identify where people feel a pain they would be willing to pay for.\u201d</p>\n<p>Springboard picked data science, business analytics, and UX design as the subjects to focus on. \u201cNot only are these areas advancing very rapidly, a lot of companies want people with these skills. A lot of people want to learn these skills to get better jobs. But it\u2019s not overcrowded yet because it is still early enough,\u201d Gupta says.</p>\n<p>2) Springboard also fine-tuned its model to give more value for the learners. If you sign up for a course or workshop, besides study materials, you also get paired with an industry expert who will mentor you one-on-one. \u201cThat resonates a lot with our audience, who are mostly early to mid-career professionals between 25 and 35 years of age. They are more flexible and also derive value from interactions with experts. Personal mentoring, having somebody who can answer the questions that they have and give appropriate feedback or advice helps them in their career trajectory,\u201d Gupta says.</p>\n<p>According to her, this level of human interaction and accountability increases the effectiveness of online education. \u201cSpringboard has a completion rate up to 10X more than the traditional online courses,\u201d she says.</p>\n<p>3) Over the last two years, Springboard has built a mentor community of close to 350 industry professionals from some of the biggest tech companies in the world \u2013 Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, eBay, and so on. \u201cPeople who are learning new skills and trying to break into a new industry enroll with us, complete courses and find new jobs, and then they come back and help the community as alumni. It\u2019s almost like building your professional network in a new field, which is very valuable to these people,\u201d Gupta says.</p>\n<p>Learners on Springboard spend US$500 to US$2,000 a month. And they stay for three to six months, depending on the course they signed up for. \u201cThe lifetime value (LTV) is US$1,500 to US$6,000. It\u2019s pretty good LTV. Our gross margins are healthy even after paying our mentors,\u201d Gupta says.</p>\n<p>\u201cEven after you take out the marketing costs, we have enough left to support our operational costs.\u201d</p>\n<h2>The experimentation phase</h2>\n<p>Springboard began as SlideRule, an aggregator for online courses, way back in July 2013. Gupta and Gautam Tambay \u2013 a Wharton School alumnus who worked with adtech company InMobi \u2013 were fascinated by the MOOC (Massive Open Online Courses) movement in the US, wanted to be part of the transformation, and built SlideRule.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">If you are getting 20X more interest, there\u2019s clearly something here. We were a little slower than we should have been in pursuing that hypothesis.</blockquote>\n<p>SlideRule would collect data about all online courses and present it coherently for learners to compare and choose from. A few breaks \u2013 for example, a Wharton professor emailed his entire online class of around 40,000 students about SlideRule the day it launched \u2013 helped it nab users, mentors, and angel investors.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re in it for the long term,\u201d I remember Gupta telling me just after SlideRule got some angel investors in early 2014. SlideRule had just started curating sequences of online courses to help learners pick up tech skills like data analysis and web development back then.</p>\n<p>The team was already looking at introducing mentors to learners and connecting with employers when it got picked by Microsoft Accelerator. By the end of 2014, they launched mentoring as a key part of their curated learning programs.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe kept talking to our users about how each version was working and what their pain-points were. We were evolving and adapting our model based on their feedback, till we came to our current model, which is mentor-guided online learning,\u201d Gupta explains.</p>\n<h2>Lean, mean startup machine</h2>\n<p>For the first ten months, Gupta and Tambay bootstrapped with just interns, freelancers, and designers. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have specialized skills. Mostly, we were working with just our common sense. We were not paying ourselves. Our spouses were supporting us. We were paying very small salaries to interns. So the quality of work was poorer. Our product was quite shabby. But we kept at it, kept working harder, and working from first principles,\u201d Gupta recalls.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">Among the investors who backed it were co-founder of LinkedIn Allen Blue and founder of The Princeton Review John Katzman.</blockquote>\n<p>The team got emotionally attached to the first couple of versions of the product \u2013 the aggregator and the recommendation engine for online courses. \u201cWe continued to invest our engineering resources in building and maintaining it long after we had enough evidence that this is not the big opportunity that will make our business. There was a period of almost lack of focus and not utilizing our resources in the best manner. We should have moved on from it faster. I count it as my personal mistake,\u201d Gupta tells me.</p>\n<p>The company saw a surge in the number of users when it made its first pivot from just an online courses aggregator to offering curated learning paths.</p>\n<p>In the first six months, with the aggregator model, they saw about 50 users a day, which grew to a few hundred, and then peaked at around a few thousand users a month. \u201cBut when we launched our curated learning paths, we hit top of the charts on Hacker News and so on. In a single day,  we got 20,000 users and our servers crashed.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you are getting 20x more interest, there\u2019s clearly something here. We were a little slower than we should have been in pursuing that hypothesis. We should have completely pulled out all of our resources from the aggregator, gotten rid of it, and devoted our attention in the new direction.\u201d</p>\n<p>After a loose network of successful entrepreneurs angel-invested in SlideRule, Gupta and Tambay hired a CTO and an operations head in San Francisco. The angel money allowed them to launch their paid pilot. \u201cIf you are charging somebody US$300 or US$400 a month, you better give them quality and service that will make them want to pay for the product. So we couldn\u2019t be very scrappy and shabby anymore,\u201d Gupta says.</p>\n<p>Springboard shifted its headquarters from Bangalore to San Francisco shortly after it raised seed funding. Among the investors who backed it were co-founder of LinkedIn Allen Blue and founder of The Princeton Review John Katzman.</p>\n<p>Apart from Allen Blue and John Katzman, its backers include founder and CEO of InMobi Naveen Tewari, Wharton School professor Kartik Hosanagar, 500 Startups, and Blue Fog Capital. SlideRule rebranded as Springboard in December 2015, after pivoting to the current mentor-guided model of education online.</p>\n<p>All of Springboard\u2019s user-facing functions, including marketing and operations, are based in the US. Its engineering office is still in Bangalore.</p>\n<h2>Edtech landscape</h2>\n<p>Globally, funding for edtech companies fell sharply in 2016 after rising steadily for three years. But it has picked up again this year, according to data from <a href=\"https://www.cbinsights.com/research/ed-tech-startup-market-map/\" target=\"_blank\">CB Insights</a>.

The funding amount was not disclosed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Thai company said it will use the funds to introduce new products aimed at enhancing transparency in emerging property markets.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hipflat\u2019s portal aggregates real estate listings from multiple sources. The startup said that it currently hosts 260,000 properties, and receives more than 30,000 inquiries from prospective buyers and renters each month. While real estate agents can list properties on Hipflat for free, the startup charges them to receive enquiries from would-be buyers and renters.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Southeast Asia\u2019s online property portal space is a crowded one, with <a href=\"http://www.propertyguru.com.sg/\" target=\"_blank\">PropertyGuru</a>, <a href=\"https://www.99.co/\" target=\"_blank\">99.co</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.iproperty.com.sg/\" target=\"_blank\">iProperty</a> just a few of the bigger names angling for market share. Hipflat says that its main point of differentiation is a proprietary data mining solution \u2013 driven by natural language processing and machine learning technologies \u2013 which enables it to extract and process real estate pricing data from hundreds of unstructured sources.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This could prove of critical value in emerging markets where official records of property transactions may often be incomplete, missing, or otherwise unavailable to the public. It would appear that this is what piqued Aucfan\u2019s interest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The potential synergy arises because the technologies both companies apply for collecting, cleaning, analyzing and presenting pricing data are similar, Hipflat founder and CEO Denis Nemtsev tells <em>Tech in Asia</em>. \u201cOne of the things I am particularly interested is Aucfan\u2019s experience in packaging the data and offering it as a paid product,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re planning to introduce advanced data analysis as a paid subscription in the future. I see a lot of interest to this kind of solution, which is especially valuable in such a fragmented and opaque market like Thailand.\u201d </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nemtsev says that Hipflat has raised a total of roughly US$1.3 million since launching in 2013, including <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/thailands-real-estate-search-site-hipflat-secures-335k-funding-sets-eye-southeast-asia\">US$335,000 in angel investment</a> in September that year. Aucfan is not the startup\u2019s first Japanese backer; VC firms OPT SEA and REAPRA \u2013 which has stakes in several startup property portals \u2013 have previously invested. Other prominent Hipflat investors include 500 Durians and Xplorer Capital.</span></p>", "spider_name": "techinasia", "id": "techinasia_434263", "has_funding_news": 0.47035741806030273}

According to the study, 60 percent of startups in Singapore are selling internationally today.</p>\n<p>Not only that, but more than 35 percent of Singaporean ventures that started out within the past year are doing business outside the city-state\u2019s limits. Almost half of them expect to cross the borders within the next year.</p>\n<p>Local startups benefit from access to tools and resources like Amazon Web Services, Google Analytics, GitHub, Trello, Hubspot, Slack, and yes, Stripe. The study collectively identifies these services as the \u201cstartup stack,\u201d a suite of more than 150 software tools that are accessed by and operate on the cloud.</p>\n<p>For the study, Stripe heard from 235 venture-funded startups. 70 percent of them were early-stage startups \u2013 of those, almost half employed five people or fewer. The company partnered with SeedPlus, Jungle Ventures, Golden Gate Ventures, General Assembly, and 500 Startups to do the survey.</p>\n<p>This is how Singapore startups feel they benefit from the startup stack.</p>\n<h2>It\u2019s cheaper and easier than ever to get started</h2>\n<p>Most startups surveyed said it\u2019s cheaper and easier to start a business in Singapore using such tools.

With an average age of 27, its employees are not far removed from the children and teenagers that make up most of their users.</p>\n<p>Makeblock is a DIY robotics construction and education platform for STEM students and educators, as well as anyone who just wants to have fun with their products\u2014what CNN called \u201c<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/19/tech/robots-lego-adult-toys/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Lego for adults</a>.\u201d</p>\n<p>I recently visited their 31st \u201cMakerthon,\u201d a regular company event where teams take two days off from their daily work to prepare creative applications for the company and present them to a panel of judges.</p>\n<p>The company\u2019s culture of fun, experimentation, and innovation has helped it become a popular startup in China. Here\u2019s an overview:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>From 2015 to 2016, their revenue went from US$6 million to US$17.5 million.</li>\n<li>They\u2019ve sold their products in over 140 countries.</li>\n<li>Earlier this year, they raised US$30 million in series B funding (total valuation of US$200 million).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Perhaps more meaningfully, they represent a generation of tech firms in China that are shedding the low-quality, copycat image of the past.</p>\n<p>The spiritual leader of Makeblock is their founder and CEO, Jasen Wang. A soft-spoken 32-year-old from a small village in the Anhui province, his vision for the company involves a hands-on, collaborative, and creative attitude.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_433730\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter text-center\">\n<img class=\" wp-image-433730\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/CEO-image.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"322\" height=\"478\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Makeblock CEO Jasen Wang.</p>\n</div>\n<p>How to best foster this kind of culture is clearly something that Wang spends a lot of time thinking about. In a meeting room next to his desk in the company\u2019s open-office floor plan, the two of us discussed his approach and challenges. Here\u2019s what I learned.</p>\n<h2><b>Invest time, energy, and money in incubating ideas</b></h2>\n<p>\u201cI always want to create new things. I really hate copying,\u201d says Wang. \u201cThat means we always need a lot of ideas.\u201d This need for ideas is what inspired the company\u2019s Makerthons in the first place, as it\u2019s a way to encourage, evaluate, and organize ideas from the company\u2019s staff. \u201cWe need to create an environment where our people can innovate and [\u2026] see their ideas used in our products.\u201d</p>\n<p>Creating this environment is not without cost. The company spends an average of US$7,500 on each Makerthon, not to mention the labor cost, as the events draw employees away from their daily work.</p>\n<p>Despite what some might view as an inefficient practice, Wang thinks it produces far more long-term value due to the product improvements it produces and the cultural and morale-building effect the events have.</p>\n<h2>Look for and encourage intrinsic motivation in employees</h2>\n<p>According to Wang:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to build a free culture, where employees can express and pursue their ideas. But I know that not everyone fits that kind of culture, so I look for people who are self-driven. That way, we just need to provide the environment where these people can succeed.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>This approach in cultivating <i>intrinsic</i>\u00a0rather than <i>extrinsic </i>motivation is grounded in behavioral science. Writer Dan Pink says in his book,\u00a0<i>Drive: The Surprise Truth About What Motivates Us,\u00a0</i>that while motivating people with rewards and punishments is fine for 20th-century tasks, it is now counterintuitive. According to him, a new people-management operation system is required, one that is based on \u201cautonomy, mastery, and purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe motivation of our employees can\u2019t come from the boss\u00a0but has to come from the employee and their relationship with the customer,\u201d<b>\u00a0</b>says Wang.</p>\n<h2><b>Filter out the takers</b></h2>\n<p>As the company has scaled, Wang has found it increasingly difficult to foster the company\u2019s culture of freedom while also maintaining control to ensure that things get done.</p>\n<p>In the past year, Makeblock has grown to over 400 employees. The money and media attention has attracted employees who are less interested in the company\u2019s mission and vision and more so in the prestige, career advancement, and financial rewards.</p>\n<p>\u201cI often fear that the culture is not as strong as before [\u2026]. Since we have a free culture and don\u2019t put so much pressure on people, some people actually will be lazy,\u201d says Wang. \u201cIn China, sometimes if the manager stops applying pressure, people stop working. Then, that makes the ones who do work hard feel that it is unfair.\u201d</p>\n<p>This means that they needed to create a recruitment and performance evaluation system which rewards those who positively contribute to the company\u2019s culture, while filtering out the behavior that takes from this environment.</p>\n<p>One way Wang does this is through values-based interviewing. He makes sure that the candidates he interviews truly understand and believe in what the company is trying to accomplish.\u00a0However, this makes the recruitment process very difficult, and Wang admits that he sometimes has to make compromises, especially with more junior-level employees. \u201cIf you keep your standards too high, you won\u2019t have enough people to do the work,\u201d he says.</p>\n<h2><b>Growth as a cultural lubricant</b></h2>\n<p>Wang recognizes that when trying to manage for innovation and collaboration, having a growing company provides a sort of \u201ccultural lubricant.\u201d People tend to be more motivated when they see growth and also often feel safer and more willing to share ideas and resources. \u201cIf the company grows fast, you don\u2019t need as much management,\u201d says Wang.</p>\n<h2><b>Think of managers as service providers</b></h2>\n<p>\u201cThe first role of the manager is as a service provider to their team,\u201d says Wang. He says that because the lower-level people are doing most of the work, then managers need to make sure these people have everything they need.</p>\n<p>This is a concept from the Google playbook. Their former HR senior vice president and architect of their current HR system, Laszlo Bock, explained the approach this way:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cIf you take that [need to control] away and instead tell managers, \u2018Your job is to make teams effective,\u2019 they\u2019re going to do the right thing. [\u2026] The effect is, as a manager, the only tool you\u2019re left with is, \u2018How can I help?\u2019 And when you come at it from that mindset, you actually make your teams better because what they\u2019re looking for from you is not control, but guidance and support and coaching.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<h2><b>Admitting imperfection and creating feedback channels</b></h2>\n<p>Wang is particularly open and reflective about his own weaknesses. \u201cI haven\u2019t been able to manage my direct reports very well,\u201d he admits. \u201cThis year, most of the department managers have been replaced. Some of these people were just unsuitable, but for some of the managers who left, I think it was my fault.\u201d</p>\n<p>As his business grows, Wang grapples with the complex nature of the problems he faces, which require him to lead more like a psychologist and less like an engineer. Wang shares that he used to solve problems in a very technical way\u2014see the problem, solve the problem\u2014and would ignore the people. But now, he is focusing more on \u201cmanaging people and emotions.\u201d</p>\n<p>One way he has done this is by holding regular AMA (Ask Me Anything) sessions, in which employees anonymously submit questions, suggestions, and complaints to Wang and the other leaders. They\u2019ll then address these in a public forum.</p>\n<p>\u201cSometimes, the questions can be very harsh. But they usually result in some kind of positive solution at the company,\u201d explains the company\u2019s HR business partner, Iris Lin.</p>\n<h2><b>Final thoughts</b></h2>\n<p>Wang and the folks at Makeblock are far from perfect. They are facing a struggle that will determine the future success of the culture that has driven their growth thus far: creating systems which avoid chaos and ensure fairness\u00a0but also reinforce the company\u2019s free environment, rather than stifle it. They must change the bathwater without throwing out the baby, but it is unclear whether this young company has the maturity and wisdom to do so effectively.</p>\n<p>However, seeing what they are trying to create and accomplish offers a very optimistic picture of how China\u2019s often-criticized millennial generation is moving away from the command-and-control workplaces of their parents and toward one that is more fun, collaborative, and innovative.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe older generations will criticize the <i>jiu ling hou </i>(post-nineties generation) and say they are very difficult to work with,\u201d Wang told me. \u201cBut if you provide a free environment, and if you can make them love what they do and feel the value, they will give you great results, often far more than you expect.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Converted from Chinese Yuan. 1 USD = 6.6 CNY.</em></p>\n<p><em>This article was first published on <a href=\"https://news.cgtn.com/news/77637a4d79597a6333566d54/share_p.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">CTGN</a>.</em></p>", "spider_name": "techinasia", "id": "techinasia_433366", "has_funding_news": 0.5433076620101929}

Facing thinning margins in Southeast Asia\u2019s heated online hotel booking space, it decided to pivot to a new business model, the startup\u2019s CEO Arjun Chopra told <em>Tech in Asia</em>.</p>\n<p>The company will now focus on developing management software for hotels, aiming to launch this new product under the name PrimeOptimax in about two to three months.</p>\n<p>As part of the pivot, Tinggal has had to let go if the\u00a0majority of its staff. The new business is very different from the old model, explains Chopra, which is why he will only retain a few employees with specific IT skills.</p>\n<p>The main reason for the pivot, he says, is dwindling profit margins. Up to 80 percent of the potential profits are soaked up by big online travel aggregators like Traveloka, PegiPegi, and Booking.com, who also market Tinggal\u2019s rooms.</p>\n<p>\u201cOne and a half years ago, we started this business targeting about 20 percent profit from each hotel room booking. But now a large part of that just gets turned into commission at larger online travel sites,\u201d says Chopra.\u201cWe realized this business is no longer promising in terms of its unit economics, comparing the expenditures and money gained.\u201d</p>\n<h2>Oyo\u2019s shadow</h2>\n<p>Tinggal launched in Indonesia in <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/uber-hotel-rooms-gaining-ground-indonesia-indian-support\">early 2016</a> in an already competitive market.</p>\n<p>It raised US$1 million in an investment round led by the founder and CEO of Tinggal\u2019s Indian sister site WudStay. Mangrove Capital Partners, Simile Venture Partners, and Vikas Saxena also participated.</p>\n<p>While Tinggal competitors Zenrooms and Nida Rooms appear to be sticking to the budget hotel booking model in Southeast Asia for now, Tinggal is not the only budget hotel aggregator looking for alternative revenue opportunities. Reddoorz and Zuzu Hotels have also developed management software for the hotels they work with. AiryRooms started to sell airplane tickets.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is also happening in India,\u201d says Chopra. \u201cBig startups like Oyo Rooms are starting to see that there is potential in\u00a0hotel software development.\u201d</p>\n<p>Oyo just picked up <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/softbank-leads-250m-funding-of-oyo\">US$250 million</a> in funding from SoftBank and others last month.

As a technology company, we\u2019d taken all the steps we knew to run and scale a company. However, one thing they don\u2019t teach you in \u201cThe Lean Startup\u201d is what to do when you start burning cash so hard it ignites a fire.</p>\n<p>Like any other founder, I launched my company with a dream in my heart and a glimmer in my eye. Or, at least I launched it with an MVP in the cloud and a sales deck on my laptop.</p>\n<p>Investors were intrigued by my idea. I can\u2019t confirm that\u2019s because it was any good, though. After all, haven\u2019t you heard about the vending machine company that just raised US$2.5 million? But after a few pitches and conversations, I got investors to buy into my vision.</p>\n<p>If I\u2019m being perfectly honest, I could have bootstrapped my company to greatness in 10 years, but I ain\u2019t got time for that shit. I convinced these investors to give me more money than my parents earned in their entire lifetimes so I could build a tool like Facebook, but better.</p>\n<p>Many people will tell you to take only as much money as you need\u00a0because investor expectations increase based on the amount of money you spend. But I was like, \u201cDaddy wants a new Cadillac and doesn\u2019t want to wait until the company\u2019s acquired, so open up your checkbooks, jerks!\u201d And somehow, these investors still gave me money, even though those are the words I literally said out loud in our final meeting.</p>\n<p>I figured that as a small company, we didn\u2019t need a CFO. Numbers? Who gives a damn about numbers when you have US$4 million in cold hard cash to spend on vintage arcade machines and state-of-the-art Japanese toilets?</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">We were on fire. Almost literally, by that point.</blockquote>\n<p>Our product was doing great! We were attracting 10,000 users a month with our obscenely large marketing budget. I mean, some of them only ever logged in once just so they could get the free meal coupon we were offering them, but 10,000 users! And 10,000 meals, all on us. We were on fire. Almost literally, by that point.</p>\n<p>Retention was difficult. But instead of testing and building the functions that might have made people use our product, I decided to instruct the team to build a feature that would allow my friend, DJ Coke Nose, to sync the colors of his iPhone notifications to the new Macklemore album. He loved the feature, at least until he had to give up his phone to pay off some of his gambling debts.</p>\n<p>I was also tasked with hiring our team. So, I personally recruited a friend from college who demanded a US$500,000 salary and the title of \u201cchief awesomeness officer\u201d (CAO). And he was awesome\u2026at everything <em>except</em> his job. In retrospect, I never really understood what I\u2019d hired him to do in the first place.</p>\n<p>Once we realized our product was tanking and that no one was willing to pay US$40 a month for color-syncing iPhone notifications, we were already feeling the heat. We asked our CAO to help, but he was away taking one of his ever-important weekly \u201cstrategy\u201d meetings on a sailboat in the Bahamas. Little did we know that we were about to ignite. Our once-promising startup was going to go down in a blaze of glory. And by glory, I mean agonizing defeat and devastating failure.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">By the end, we were quite literally pushing together stacks of money and lighting them on fire.</blockquote>\n<p>By the end, we were quite literally pushing together stacks of money and lighting them on fire. But that was only because we\u2019d burned through so much money that we couldn\u2019t pay the heating bill, so we had to keep ourselves warm.</p>\n<p>I know it\u2019s hard to believe that I burned through so much money the police had to send over four fire trucks when I caused a four alarm blaze. But, believe me when I say we needed that US$20,000 espresso machine, especially when we realized how quickly our cash was burning and poured espresso shots all over it to try to put it out.</p>\n<p>Once I realized our startup was going to explode, I instructed people to run for cover. Except, we didn\u2019t have much cover because we\u2019d spent all our money on augmented reality desks that didn\u2019t actually exist in the real world but looked really cool when you viewed them through our app. With that, Sheena from IT dialed 911 and we got out of there unscathed while our investors stood by and watched their money go up in smoke.</p>\n<p>So, let this be a lesson to you: If you get funding for your startup, be strategic. Don\u2019t let yourself get carried away spending on things you don\u2019t need. Keep your headcount low until it\u2019s absolutely necessary to grow. Focus on improving your product. If you hire a CAO, make sure you know what that person does. And if you find you do need to spend some of that investor money, make sure you spend some of it on a good sprinkler system, too.</p>\n<p><em>This article was first published on <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/i-burned-through-so-much-investor-cash-the-fire-department-showed-up-ea5a4dc8301b\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Medium</a>.</em></p>", "spider_name": "techinasia", "id": "techinasia_433014", "has_funding_news": 0.22321970760822296}

Photo credit: Michael Holmes Photo / Tech in Asia.</p>\n</div>\n<p>\u201cThe way I generally describe the seed round is that raising the money at that stage is pretty much 100 percent smoke and mirrors,\u201d says Michael Litt. \u201cSelling the vision, selling the dream.\u201d</p>\n<p>An entrepreneur at that stage has to communicate very clearly what he or she wants to do.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou have very little traction \u2013 it\u2019s just about the vision that you have. And it\u2019s not necessarily the size of the vision, it\u2019s your capability to communicate the reality of that vision which ultimately relates to your success in raising the seed round,\u201d adds Litt.</p>\n<p>The 30-year-old Canadian did all that six years ago when his startup, <a href=\"https://www.vidyard.com\" target=\"_blank\">Vidyard</a>, a sort of Youtube for businesses, got some seed money.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe series A is, like, 20 percent how your business is performing and 80 percent smoke and mirrors. \u2018Cause you might have that initial traction, some unit economics that make sense. It would indicate the size of your opportunity and your ability to scale.\u201d</p>\n<p>That all changes with the next injection of cash.</p>\n<p>\u201cSeries B, I think, is when that flips. It becomes 80 percent how your business is performing and 20 percent smoke and mirrors. And then finally the series C, for us, was like 100 percent what are the economics of the business,\u201d Litt explained onstage last week at Tech in Asia Tokyo 2017.</p>\n<p>Now his company employs 230 people across two offices in Canada and one in the US. It\u2019s grown from 100 staffers in just the last 18 months.</p>\n<h2>Reinventing me</h2>\n<p>In the past six years, the Vidyard founder has gone through many versions of himself.</p>\n<p>\u201cReinvention of yourself happens frequently \u2013 for me it\u2019s been kinda on a four or six-month cadence,\u201d he explains.</p>\n<p>Litt transformed into a sales rep for some time as his business, like all software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies, chased after crucial enterprise customers.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was the one who was cold-calling initially,\u201d the CEO chuckles. \u201cI was doing about 100 calls a day.\u201d</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_432865\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/TIA-TYO-2017-0928-Main-Stage-111115-0556_wm.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" class=\"size-full wp-image-432865\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Michael Litt (left) interviewed by James Riney. Photo credit: Michael Holmes Photo / Tech in Asia.</p>\n</div>\n<p>All startups similarly change form over time, which Litt visualizes in an imaginary chart as he talks onstage with host James Riney, the boss of 500 Startups Japan.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think there\u2019s this bell curve that you go through where you start a company, you have this vision for the problem you want to solve and how you want to take this thing to market, but then as you go through the rounds you get mired into operating the business,\u201d Litt elaborates. \u201cAt series A, you\u2019re one of the sales reps in the company, specifically as the CEO or the business lead. Series B is the same. And what happened to us at series C is that you come out of the operational mire and you have to think about the vision again. And it\u2019s just like it was when you started the company.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cYou wear all those hats in the early stages, but now you\u2019ve got people who wear those hats \u2013 so your job as CEO is to lead, dictate the vision, and obviously to work with the team and think about culture, scale, HR challenges, all sorts of things that you started the company for and thought about, but you hadn\u2019t thought for the past few years,\u201d he says.</p>\n<h2>Hiring and re-wiring</h2>\n<p>Aside from juggling investors and hats, Litt sees early technical hires as especially crucial to the success of a SaaS business.</p>\n<p>\u201cOur primary goal was in engineering specifically,\u201d says Litt, referring to when his startup graduated out of Y Combinator. \u201cBecause in what we do, an online video platform, we have to build scalable and complex technology which hosts and streams videos in a reliable fashion [\u2026] before we can add incremental value to what we do.\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s why he decided to make Waterloo the main HQ, as there was a YouTube office with lots of talent to swipe.</p>\n<p>Vidyard\u2019s first 10 hires were in engineering and sales.</p>\n<p>\u201cHeavy, heavy, heavy on the product engineering\u201d \u2013 that was the early mantra in order to grow.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_432869\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/TIA-TYO-2017-0928-Audience-135359-0884_wm.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" class=\"size-full wp-image-432869\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Audience. Photo credit: Michael Holmes Photo / Tech in Asia.</p>\n</div>\n<p>By the time of the 12th staffer, Litt felt he needed a CFO. \u201cI think it\u2019s early for a lot of companies to have a CFO when they\u2019re only 12 people,\u201d he concedes. But there was a cunning plan.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn Canada there\u2019s a ton of programs designed to fund research and development, new hire programs, etcetera. And so we made a deal with Matt, our CFO, that we would hire him if he could pay for himself in grants and bursaries and loans and stuff from the government. And he more than 2x paid for himself in that first year,\u201d Litt says. The startup has made use of Canadian grants in other ways to help with growth.</p>\n<p>In new hires he looks for candidates with \u201cgrit\u201d \u2013 \u201cthis concept that you have a vision and a goal and you\u2019ll do whatever it takes to achieve that goal.\u201d</p>\n<p>But it\u2019s not always easy to find that trait.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn North America specifically, this current generation of millennials a lot of people think lack that grit,\u201d he says, passing the buck onto the <em>vox populi</em>. \u201cA big part of my job now is inspiring that in people. But I think it\u2019s absolutely there.\u201d</p>\n<h2>Legwork</h2>\n<p>Litt recalls more of the legwork behind the rapid growth that investors demanded to see.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen you think about series A through C stage, if you\u2019re trying to triple your business year-on-year, it\u2019s actually really difficult. So once you get to US$1 million revenue you wanna go to US$3 million, then you have to go from three to nine \u2013 and three to nine is really tough. The way we did that was by forcing ourselves in the market through scaling this initial calling program I started.\u201d</p>\n<p>That meant more people on the phones \u2013 and also a lot of lead-generation came from going to events.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019d sometimes drive to the event, we\u2019d park the car covered in Vidyard stickers on the lawn to drive awareness. We\u2019d extrapolate every single lead we could from that show,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>But when the events started taking up too much time for insufficient returns, Litt began to regret not investing more in digital marketing and outreach at an earlier stage.</p>\n<p>Still, he cautions that SaaS startups can spend too much time in digital storytelling when they need to focus more on converting to actual sales.</p>\n<h2>\u2018Leaking at the seams\u2019</h2>\n<p>Litt says that building a good culture in a startup is always \u201ca work in progress,\u201d but in his experience it was at the 50-employee mark that his startup came into crisis.</p>\n<p>\u201cI started to feel things were leaking at the seams a little bit. Up until then, we did daily stand-ups at the company\u201d \u2013 literally every staffer standing up to explain briefly their objectives for the day \u2013 \u201cbut then it became a bit of a grind,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>So, with more than 50 people on the payroll, it changed to a weekly stand-up. He also drew up a \u201ccultural agreement\u201d that new hires must sign and added a ceremonial handprint ritual to make the agreement feel concrete.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s kinda weird as I describe it to an external group,\u201d he admits to the audience, but he finds it effective in stamping the firm\u2019s culture on employees.</p>\n<p>\u201cOne of the things told to me by a mentor is that when the 100th person joins your company, they do not give a crap with respect to what the previous 99 went through. They don\u2019t care about the lore of the company and some heroic move the CEO made, or when they closed some wicked deal. They care about their experience from that point forwards.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat really resonated with me,\u201d he says of that bit of advice.</p>\n<p>Now, a big part of his job is ensuring that the culture evolves whilst also preventing it from unravelling.</p>\n<p>\u201cI try to put every fire out myself,\u201d he says of his current incarnation as CEO of a startup that has raised series C. When he\u2019s not doing that, he\u2019s focusing on his team achieving three things: \u201cI think about revenue growth, I think about the net retention of our customers \u2013 we\u2019re a SaaS business so are we keeping our customers and are we growing them on a cohort basis, quarter over quarter? And I think about burn rate. That\u2019s really how I isolate my thinking.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>This is part of the coverage of <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/tag/tiatokyo2017\">Tech in Asia Tokyo 2017</a>, our conference which took place September 27 and 28.</em></p>", "spider_name": "techinasia", "id": "techinasia_432856", "has_funding_news": 0.5001941323280334}
{"article_id": "432754", "article_title": "Why Mobike and Ofo\u2019s bikes are like \u2018wolves in the wild\u2019", "story_url": "https://www.techinasia.com/talk/mobike-ofo-wolves-in-the-wild", "author": "Jeffrey Towson", "time": "2017-10-05T08:33:20", "content": "<p>In parts <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/talk/china-bike-sharing-powerful\" rel=\"nofollow\">one</a> and <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/talk/bikesharing-grows-fast-free\" rel=\"nofollow\">two</a>, I argued that we were witnessing something new and powerful with bike-sharing companies in China. These companies and their presence in consumers\u2019 lives have grown too fast.</p>\n<p>My explanation for this is the assets-in-the-wild scenario, i.e. the ability of bike-sharing companies to release large numbers of mostly independent assets into the wild. These assets are then able to exist and sell products and services mostly on their own and in spaces outside of traditional offline or online retail.</p>\n<p>My definition of a wild asset is the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They can exist mostly on their own in the world or in a controlled environment (an office or a park).<b>\u00a0</b>They don\u2019t need much support or maintenance.</li>\n<li>They can market, sell, and\u00a0deliver products or services mostly on their\u00a0own.<b>\u00a0</b>Their real power is that they are <em>points of sale</em>. Thus, they can sell in spaces that have never been \u201cretail spaces\u201d before (office hallways, subways, parks, and even the skies).</li>\n<li>They can be released in large numbers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That\u2019s my explanation for the startling power of bike-sharing. However, when you look at examples of existing and emerging wild assets, a few sets of questions pop up:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>How often does the asset need to be serviced or to come home?</b> How frequently does it need to replenish inventory, to charge up its batteries, to get maintenance, etc.? And how rugged and durable is the asset?</li>\n<li>\n<b>Does the asset market, sell, and\u00a0deliver the product or service in the wild?</b>\u00a0These functions usually determine how complicated the asset is. Bicycles are a really nice example because they do all three things in a pretty simple way. But smart vending machines and check-out free convenience stores are points of sale systems only and need their inventory to be replenished.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Is the asset\u00a0</b><b>stationary</b><b>, </b><b>mobile but requiring direction</b><b>, or </b><b>independently mobile</b><b>?</b> Vending machines are stationary. Bicycles are mobile but get their direction from the user. Autonomous taxis are going to be very mobile but will require directions when not in use. The asset\u2019s mobility matters.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The economics of the asset tends to follow the above questions. Just to make things simple, I\u2019ll explain these in terms of house cats vs wolves.</p>\n<h2><b>House cats vs wolves</b></h2>\n<h3>House cats</h3>\n<p>House cats mostly live in homes and backyards and get their food at home every day. They\u2019re not great at surviving on the streets on their own (raccoons tend to eat them).</p>\n<p>I use \u201chouse cats\u201d as a description of wild assets you would mostly release in offices, shopping malls, universities, homes, and local neighborhoods. These are assets that need a boundary or some degree of protection or support, often needing a lot of support (new inventories, recharges, or a launching/maintenance pad).</p>\n<p>A lot of new retail systems are close to this. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The new smart vending machines by companies like Citybox are somewhat independent. These small staff-less convenience kiosks are being placed in offices and business parks and are delivering things like snacks and fresh fruits. But they are stationary and need a lot of support.</li>\n<li>The new check-out free convenience stores being deployed by companies like Bingobox and Guoxiaomei are also not mobile and require restocking and electricity.</li>\n<li>We are increasingly seeing smart vending machines for new niche products and services such as high-tech coffee machines, fresh squeezed orange juice machines, video games, and standalone karaoke kiosks.</li>\n</ul>\n<div id=\"attachment_432831\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter text-center\">\n<img class=\" wp-image-432831\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAomAAAAJDUyMTEzNzE0LWM3ODAtNDAwYS1hZTMzLTM0YWVlMDRkZDlkMg-1024x845.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"523\" height=\"432\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A father buys from a new orange juice machine while his daughters wait.</p>\n</div>\n<div id=\"attachment_432834\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter text-center\">\n<img class=\" wp-image-432834\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAvlAAAAJDE1MzQ2ODY4LTUxYzgtNGQ5Zi04NGM1LTdmOGYyOTJiMDE1Yw-1024x771.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"522\" height=\"393\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Karaoke booths in a Chinese shopping mall.</p>\n</div>\n<p>But couldn\u2019t these new retail assets become more and more independent? Couldn\u2019t they become more mobile? Could coffee machines roam the hallways of a business park?</p>\n<p>There are types of house cats that differ from this. What about security monitors you could deploy around your neighborhood or school? How about electric scooters you could freely use at a university or in the office park? How about mobile advertisements?</p>\n<h3>Wolves</h3>\n<p>At the other end of the spectrum are the wolves. You release them into the wild and you don\u2019t really see them much again. These are the wild assets that can exist in public spaces because they don\u2019t need staffing, support, or to be returned to the shop, office, or garage often. They are durable and can be mobile or mostly stationary.</p>\n<p>Mobike\u2019s smart bikes are the perfect example for this. They are designed not to need maintenance or any other support for three to four years. They have airless tires, their chains have been replaced by shaft transmissions, they are made of anti-rust aluminum, and they don\u2019t need external electricity to power their smart locks and GPS.</p>\n<p>Here are some examples of wolves:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Transportation assets that are advancing rapidly. On-demand bikes have been joined by electric bicycles, electric bicycles have been joined by on-demand\u00a0scooters, and autonomous taxis and shared cars are coming soon.</li>\n</ul>\n<div id=\"attachment_432832\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter text-center\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-432832\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAoQAAAAJGIxZDU1MjY4LWI1YmUtNGZmYS1hNGRjLWUyMjliYjI4OWQyMQ-1024x681.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"575\" height=\"382\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A Mango electric scooter.</p>\n</div>\n<div id=\"attachment_432833\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter text-center\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-432833 \" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/AAEAAQAAAAAAAArYAAAAJGIxYzg5MjFkLTVmNzEtNDViNC04NDE4LTE4MDlhNmZhZGM3OA.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"571\" height=\"539\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Chinese electric and gas karts are constantly being upgraded.</p>\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li>Micro-rentals have also been appearing in China this year. These include basketballs kiosks, umbrellas on railings around the city, and batteries you can just pick up and use.</li>\n<li>Security cameras and other security assets are types of wolves as well. They are mostly independent as monitors. Whether they start patrolling roads, office parks, universities, and borders will be interesting to see.</li>\n<li>Drones are another example. In China, pilotless drones can now be hired to spray farms while other drones circle and check for pollution. These drones already operate out in the world with a surprising degree of independence.</li>\n<li>More traditional wild assets like outdoor signage (print and digital), park benches, vending machines, police speeding cameras, and post office boxes. These assets are all getting smarter.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><b>Capital costs vs operating costs</b></h2>\n<p>Smart bikes have upfront capital costs that depreciate over several years but don\u2019t need a lot of maintenance and operating costs. You do have some operating costs, as the locations of the bicycles need to be rebalanced over time (bikes tend to accumulate at the bottoms of hills).</p>\n<p>Compare this to shared electric bikes (like the Xiangqi bike in the\u00a0photo below) which have greater capital, maintenance, and operating costs. You have to replenish these bikes\u2019 electricity about every 24 hours, so they require battery charging or battery swapping stations.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_432835\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter text-center\">\n<img class=\" wp-image-432835\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAvrAAAAJGVkNjJkMTM0LWFhYzQtNDc0Yi1iNzVjLTI0YThmMDQzNjBmNw-1024x765.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"623\" height=\"465\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A Xiangqi electric bike.</p>\n</div>\n<p>New smart vending machines, retail pods, stand-alone kiosks, and other house cats may or may not have greater capital costs. Assets in more controlled environments don\u2019t have to be as durable, and their depreciation expense will depend on how long they last. But these assets usually have greater operating costs. You need to replenish the inventory of the retail spaces frequently. They also might use a lot of electricity depending on what they do, how mobile they are, and how far they roam.</p>\n<p>So, it varies asset by asset. But the economics come down to five numbers, which gets you an average profitability per asset over time:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Price of good or service</li>\n<li>Capital costs and depreciation schedule</li>\n<li>Idle costs\u2014maintenance, inventory, and other fixed operating costs per asset deployed</li>\n<li>Usage costs\u2014cost of goods sold (COGS), wear-and-tear, and other variable operating costs per asset deployed</li>\n<li>Utilization per asset</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><b>Final point</b></h3>\n<p>Ok, this article was a lot of theory. So, let me make just one final point. In the above cost picture, you aren\u2019t seeing marketing spend, distribution or retail costs, sales staff costs, and rental costs.</p>\n<p>It turns out, the economics are almost all about utilization. Utilization ultimately determines profitability and is the factor nobody seems to be talking about in bike-sharing. But it is actually the thing that determines the success of companies like Mobike and Ofo. Utilization also raises the fascinating question of herd size vs herd intelligence, which I will discuss more in part four.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading.</p>\n<p><em>This article was first published on the <a href=\"http://jefftowson.com/2017/09/how-new-retail-is-colliding-with-bike-sharing-in-china%E2%80%8B-pt-3-of-4/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">author\u2019s blog</a>.</em></p>", "spider_name": "techinasia", "id": "techinasia_432754", "has_funding_news": 0.34482505917549133}

Photo credit: <a href=\"https://static.pexels.com/photos/262706/pexels-photo-262706.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\">Pexels</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Ebay pioneered the asset-light marketplace connecting buyers and sellers. Amazon chose a more managed model with warehousing and logistics. Niche ecommerce company <a href=\"https://www.gozefo.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Zefo</a> is taking that Amazon model to another level by managing the buying and selling of used goods end-to-end, including refurbishment, quality checks, and price assessment.</p>\n<p>This is aimed at solving the two key pain-points of used goods trading: distrust from buyers and hassles for sellers. With those taken care of, the main attractions of used goods kick in: deep discounts and wide variety. The hunt for bargains can begin without nagging doubts about being swindled. And sellers needn\u2019t worry about dressing up those used but functional goods.</p>\n<p>All that is fine in theory, but managing it on the ground poses huge challenges. India\u2019s a big market where consumers love bargains and are moving online in droves. But they can be very suspicious about claims regarding used goods.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">If you don\u2019t scale fast, it will be difficult for us or anyone else to crack the mobile phones category.</blockquote>\n<p>Zefo appears to have overcome the initial skepticism. Last year in November, when it <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/zefo-ecommerce-raises-6-million\">raised its first funding round</a>, it had around 30,000 consumers in Bangalore. Now, it claims to have served about 150,000 consumers, growing 30 percent month-on-month. It also expanded to Mumbai and Delhi last year.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhen you run a business, the biggest thing is the product-market fit. Will the consumer adopt a solution like yours? I think the sort of growth that we saw over the last one year, that has been the most pleasing aspect,\u201d Zefo\u2019s CEO and co-founder Rohit Ramasubramanian tells <em>Tech in Asia</em>.</p>\n<p>Zefo wants to be the online \u201csuper store\u201d for used goods, without compromising on its managed process even as it scales up. To do that, it has closed a series B funding round of US$9.2 million from the same set of investors who put in US$6 million last year: Sequoia India, Helion Venture Partners, and Beenext from Japan.</p>\n<p>The money is going to come in handy as Zefo zeroes in on the efficiency of its core operational processes like logistics, warehousing, and refurbishments. To understand Zefo\u2019s focus on these, you need to know its business model.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_365333\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Unboxed-sofa-in-Zefo.png\" alt=\"Unboxed sofa in Zefo\" width=\"1001\" height=\"459\" class=\"size-full wp-image-365333\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The unboxed sofa I was eyeing in Zefo.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Not the usual classifieds business</h2>\n<p>Zefo is not your typical used goods marketplace, which operates more or less like the classifieds.</p>\n<p>Zefo buys the products from a seller \u2013 it could be you getting rid of that LED TV or furniture etailer Urban Ladder selling its factory seconds. It handles the logistics, takes the product into its warehouse, does quality assessment, cleans and disinfects it, and then refurbishes it if required. Only after that lengthy process does Zefo catalog and upload the details and pictures of the product \u2013 \u201cincluding those of defects if any,\u201d Ramasubramanian points out.</p>\n<p>If by any chance, the consumer runs into some trouble with the product she bought on Zefo, she would get after Zefo and not the original seller. This is unlike the typical used goods marketplace which does little to assess the quality of listed products. This is what Ramasubramanian cites as the value Zefo brings to the table. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s important for the company to work on making that better and better.</p>\n<p>\u201cUntil recently, we had a basic TV repair facility, where we did quality checks and repairs. Our capacity was around 25 TVs per day. Now we have upgraded it to a state-of-the-art facility which can handle about 200 TVs per day,\u201d  Ramasubramanian cites as an example of the kind of \u201cenhancements\u201d Zefo wants to do with the latest capital infusion.</p>\n<p>It has also launched a third product category for mobile phones, after starting with furniture and expanding to include appliances. Some of the funding will go into setting up quality check processes for the new category and getting the operations right.</p>\n<p>\u201cMobile phones as a category is typically a volume game, both for new as well as used devices. If you cannot scale quickly, then your margins will never work out. If you don\u2019t scale fast, it will be difficult for us or anyone else to crack that category,\u201d Ramasubramanian tells me.</p>\n<h2>Refurbishing is no mean task</h2>\n<p>Zefo faces competition from classifieds sites OLX and Quikr as well as eBay India, which got acquired by Amazon\u2019s Indian rival Flipkart earlier this year. Flipkart can ramp up the used and refurbished goods on eBay India with the products it receives in exchange offers and buyback guarantee schemes. Amazon India has also made a foray into used goods, starting with books.</p>\n<p>But, as Zefo\u2019s experience shows, it\u2019s no mean task to assess and refurbish used or unboxed goods. That\u2019s where the opportunity lies for a niche player focused on doing this in a huge, unorganized market.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_365332\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Zefo-founders.jpg\" alt=\"Zefo founders\" width=\"950\" height=\"533\" class=\"size-full wp-image-365332\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Zefo founders. Photo credit: Zefo.</p>\n</div>\n<p>\u201cThis is an operationally complex business \u2013 not as simple as a listing site where you put up  products and people would start transacting. In order to maintain the quality, which ultimately is our strength and differentiator, there are a lot of steps that we take. Otherwise, this business won\u2019t work. The big challenge is to maintain our growth rate and sort of grow our supply, demand, and operations in sync,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>One of the first things Zefo co-founders did when introducing the mobile phones category was to recruit a senior hand to head the repairs unit for it. That was because they had learned from an earlier mistake. They took a year to hire an industry senior to take charge of their TV repairs unit. \u201cHe is the one who scaled up our repairs facility to what it is now \u2013 which is 15 times larger with way more span. Until he came, we had worked with junior technicians. On hindsight, that was a mistake. We should have made that hire a long time back,\u201d Ramasubramanian tells me.</p>\n<p>He co-founded Zefo in August 2015 with his former colleague from Helion Venture Partners Karan Gupta. Two other co-founders are Himesh Joshi, former consultant with the Boston Consulting Group, and Arjit Gupta, who earlier worked with Amazon and Flipkart.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">I don\u2019t want to comment on the specifics of profitability \u2013 it always gets misconstrued.</blockquote>\n<p>Zefo, as they envisioned it, \u201csits nicely on our Indian value-for-money mindset.\u201d It\u2019s the value aspect that makes the business sustainable, says Ramasubranian, even though its heavily managed process for logistics, quality checks, and refurbishment add to costs. How to give a bargain and also ensure quality \u2013 or value-for-money \u2013 is a balancing act for all marketplaces, and especially those in used goods.</p>\n<p>The Zefo CEO declined revealing revenue and expense figures, but claimed it has a sustainable margin despite the extra expenditure involved in its business model compared to that of OLX, Quikr, or eBay.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause we are able to add value through the entire quality check process, our margin is healthier compared to the classifieds business. We make sure that our margin works within our cost of operations. We try to hit a sweet spot which works for the consumer, seller, and us,\u201d he says, without specifying Zefo\u2019s margin or going into details on the costs of quality checks and refurbishment of specific products.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis business is not so cut and dry\u2026 There\u2019s operations, warehousing, marketing, supplier acquisition, team, and so on. Each of these are sizable cost heads. We have to optimize all of this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ramasubramanian also did not want to go into specifics on cash burn and path to profitability. \u201cI don\u2019t want to comment on the specifics of profitability \u2013 it always gets misconstrued. But I can say that profitability is a core goal,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I look at our largest market, which is Bangalore, we are pretty close to profitability. Growth is not the main driver for us in Bangalore right now, but profitability is the metric we are rising towards. As we get more and more efficient, we will automatically become profitable.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to Ramasubramanian, Zefo opted for a measured approach to growth, banking on word-of-mouth to lure customers and keeping its acquisition costs low. That, he says, has helped them build the business in a more sustainable manner. The fresh funding was raised to step on the pedal now.</p>", "spider_name": "techinasia", "id": "techinasia_432697", "has_funding_news": 0.3449835777282715}

Every year those families literally burn US$3 billion of their hard-earned income on kerosene, disposable batteries, and other dangerous and suboptimal energy solutions, says Greg Krasnov, chairman of <a href=\"http://solar-home.asia/en/\" target=\"_blank\">SolarHome</a>.</p>\n<p>There are solar systems available for off-grid consumers but these usually cost US$100 up front. The rural population, consisting of farmers, fishermen, and village shop owners, don\u2019t have that type of money in savings, he adds.</p>\n<p>So his Singapore-based company thought of a clever way to allow these people to purchase clean and reliable electricity \u2013 which is through small increments, similar to how they top up their phones. The company just closed a US$625,000 pre-series A round, bringing its total funding to date to over US$1.1 million.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how it works: consumers shell out a small down payment to have the solar system installed on their houses, complete with panels, batteries, and electronics. To use it, they will need to buy daily, weekly, or monthly credit \u2013 averaging US$3 to US$15 per month \u2013 either through scratch cards or mobile money. The ownership of the system will be automatically \u201cunlocked\u201d and transferred to them after two years.</p>\n<p>SolarHome\u2019s pay-as-you-go (PAYG) model lowers the barriers to adoption for rural families who earn US$85 a month and have no access to bank loans, Krasnov says.</p>\n<p>He adds that unlike other solar systems in the market which are of low quality, difficult to assemble, and expensive to maintain, SolarHome offers a two-year warranty. \u201cIt creates a unique value proposition.\u201d</p>\n<h2>Creating social returns</h2>\n<p>SolarHome is one of the startups spun off by venture builder Forum Capital, where Krasnov also sits as managing director. Forum, which had injected US$500,000 seed funding into the company, is focused on inclusive fintech and consumer finance in Southeast Asia.</p>\n<p>Krasnov says they stumbled upon the idea for SolarHome when Forum was exploring ways to enter the renewable energy market in 2015. As part of their research, they came across information about a leading solar PAYG company in Africa called M-Kopa. \u201cUpon closer examination we fell in love with the model,\u201d he recalls. \u201cPAYG is a microfinance-enabled product so it is very close to our core competencies in financial inclusion and we knew we could bring fantastic management and a group of senior advisors into this.\u201d</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_432693\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-432693 size-full\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/solarhome-solar-panels.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"950\" height=\"530\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: SolarHome.</p>\n</div>\n<p>They were also encouraged by the massive social returns such a company could bring. By going solar, poor families in rural areas not only avoid health injuries caused by kerosene, they can also extend their working hours and earn more, allow their kids to study longer, and contribute to efforts to reduce carbon emissions in the environment. \u201cSolarHome did a study, with the support of USAID, which showed that every dollar invested by our business in the systems out in the field brings back a social return of approximately 400 percent. Now that\u2019s real impact,\u201d Krasnov stresses.</p>\n<h2>Scaling up</h2>\n<p>The team has completed a pilot in Myanmar and will use the fresh funds to scale up in Southeast Asia amid rising competition from other PAYG solar companies. <a href=\"http://www.dlight.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Dlight</a> and <a href=\"https://www.angaza.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Angaza</a> are some of those targeting developing markets globally.</p>\n<p>SolarHome aims to increase its installations to over 10,000 units next year from approximately 2,000 units by end-2017. \u201cWe expect the company to generate US$2 million to US$3 million run-rate revenue and become EBITDA positive by the end of 2018,\u201d notes Krasnov.</p>\n<p>Its pre-series A round was led by Uberis Capital, with participation from Beenext Venture Capital and other unnamed regional investors.</p>\n<p>Uberis Capital managing partner Nicolas de Boisgrollier is nothing but bullish about the startup\u2019s prospects.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe PAYG model has emerged as a clear leader in off-grid electrification in Africa, India, and Latin America, having reached millions of homes and attracted over US$500 million of investment over the last few years,\u201d he says. \u201cWe see the same tailwinds in Southeast Asia \u2013 massive off-grid population, rise of alternative credit scoring and mobile money, and a growing acknowledgement by governments that distributed generation is the answer.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cUnlike many other renewables businesses, PAYG is very scalable and operates profitably without subsidies, which makes this business model very attractive,\u201d he further states.</p>\n<p>When it comes to the off-grid segment \u2013 prior to the emergence of PAYG \u2013 the most widespread model has been the renewables-powered mini grid. This model, however, has a number of potential issues, according to Krasnov. First, you need to sign up a significant proportion of the village population prior to installing anything, just to have enough revenue visibility to secure initial financing. That means a hurdle to project launch and high customer acquisition cost, as well as difficulties in scaling \u2013 after all, it is much easier to convince one customer than a whole village.</p>\n<p>Mini grids also tend to require expensive sophisticated equipment to be put in the field, which entails high servicing cost. \u201cBasically, without the significant development finance and other donor subsidies, the mini grid model is not really economically viable today. PAYG has proven in Africa to be a massively superior business model, with hundreds of thousands of homes already successfully covered in much shorter time,\u201d Krasnov explains.</p>", "spider_name": "techinasia", "id": "techinasia_432548", "has_funding_news": 0.2925949692726135}

Or, at the very least, smoldering.</p>\n<p>My company,\u00a0<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://raygun.com/platform/crash-reporting\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Raygun</a>, had just five people in the team five years ago. Now, we\u2019re building products for businesses like\u00a0Nordstrom. But with this growth comes many learning opportunities.</p>\n<p>During our highest growth periods,\u00a0<span class=\"markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other\">I\u2019ve found that the key to effective product management lies in two main areas:\u00a0<strong>taming fires</strong>\u00a0and\u00a0<strong>winning friends</strong>.</span></p>\n<p>To survive in a high-growth environment, you must learn to prioritize and then get your team on board, so the whole team becomes focused on the strategic direction of the company. In this post, I\u2019ll share how I\u2019ve learned to tame fires and win friends along the way.</p>\n<h2>How to tame fires with extreme\u00a0focus</h2>\n<p>Building products are chaotic. If you have too many fires and not enough buckets, you\u2019ll spend too much time firefighting and not enough time building. This leads product quality to suffer and product direction to be determined by problems.</p>\n<p>In my experience, too many fires come from:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Not enough buckets</li>\n<li>Not knowing what you don\u2019t know (you\u2019re not technical enough)</li>\n<li><span class=\"markup--quote markup--li-quote is-other\">The idea that all problems are highly urgent and important</span></li>\n<li>Not enough/too many data points and not enough time to interpret them</li>\n<li><span class=\"markup--quote markup--li-quote is-other\">Trying to be everything for everyone and solving everything</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Early on, I recognized that there was a need to put some fire-taming strategies in place. So, here\u2019s what I do on a day-to-day basis to ensure things don\u2019t get the better of me.</p>\n<h3>Find a prioritization framework that works for\u00a0you</h3>\n<p><a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://foldingburritos.com/product-prioritization-techniques/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">This article</a>\u00a0by Daniel Zacarias\u00a0summarizes 20 prioritization techniques and discusses that prioritization is the result of not having enough resources\u2014a very typical scenario in product management. Each prioritization framework caters to different needs, but whichever one you choose will help you organize, prioritize, and establish relationships between company and customer.</p>\n<p>In my team, we lean heavily on our tools like Slack, JIRA, and our own tool, which helps me see performance optimization tasks by priority.</p>\n<h3>Get to know your co-workers and their strengths</h3>\n<p>You\u2019re responsible for outcomes, not inputs. To do that, you must be able to rally your team around your ideas.\u00a0<span class=\"markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other\">In a high-growth environment, you simply can\u2019t afford internal team politics</span>.\u00a0<span class=\"markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other\">Knowing the right person for the job can cut out a lot of time, instead of a generic Slack message saying, \u201cCan anyone help me with\u2026?\u201d</span></p>\n<h3>Quarterly deliverables to keep the team (and yourself) on\u00a0track</h3>\n<p>One thing that works well at my company is setting a quarterly product deliverable that surrounds your smaller must do\u2019s into one overarching theme. Take it a step further and ask your design team to make posters to put around the office and have a team celebration once you meet that goal. Create a clear definition of what \u201cdone\u201d means. This will keep you on track.</p>\n<h3>Focus on the outputs, not the inputs</h3>\n<p>I did mention this a little earlier, but\u00a0<em>no one cares about the inputs, except you!\u00a0</em>So don\u2019t fret too much about the details. In my team, we adopt Facebook\u2019s previous motto with a twist. We say,\u00a0<span class=\"markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other\">\u201cMove fast and break things, but fix them quickly.\u201d Sticking to this will keep</span>\u00a0the development team\u2019s technical debt to a minimum and will reassure your customers that if there\u2019s a problem, it will be fixed in a reasonable timeframe.</p>\n<h3>Product managers need to evolve</h3>\n<p>When moving quickly, it pays for product managers to be a few steps ahead by\u00a0<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"http://www.stream121.com/whitepapers/how_to_hire_a_product_manager.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">anticipating company needs</a>\u00a0before they arrive. Where will your company be in three, five, or 10 years? You don\u2019t need to know exactly, but it\u2019s a fun thought exercise and can help you sort opportunities from distractions.</p>\n<h2>How to win friends while taming\u00a0fires</h2>\n<p>Your soft skills are your best friend as a product manager. You must be able to rally your team around a goal.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve found that common challenges to this are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Not communicating enough</li>\n<li>Not communicating promptly</li>\n<li>Stakeholders that withhold information from you (unintentionally)</li>\n<li>Timezone/location challenges (if in a different country)</li>\n<li>People not knowing what you do or thinking you don\u2019t do much</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As the company has grown, I\u2019ve continued to work on our communication process, especially because our team is multiplying and everyone needs to stay in the loop.</p>\n<p>Here are the things I do to maintain open communication lines throughout the product lifecycle.</p>\n<h3>Regular marketing catch-ups</h3>\n<p>Every two weeks, I meet with the marketing team for a catch up around what needs to be announced. This way, we can add announcements into the content calendar. If it\u2019s a larger feature or even a new product, this also gives us time to organize messaging and a launch strategy.</p>\n<h3>Maintain excellent communication with customers</h3>\n<p>To keep in touch with customers, you can send a monthly newsletter by email with all product releases and any significant marketing announcements. Any product updates get their own blog announcement and documentation which can then be sent through an in-app message.</p>\n<h3>Maintain clear communication with investors</h3>\n<p>A habit we got into early on was to send monthly Raygun updates to let our investors know what we are working on and which releases are coming up. Our CEO, John-Daniel Trask, wrote an article about what a good investor report looks like\u00a0<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://medium.com/@traskjd/good-investor-updates-604f9a889d63\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2>Taming fires and winning friends are\u00a0skills</h2>\n<p>Both prioritizing tasks and maintaining healthy communications are skills that are learned, which means they can be improved.

Already, you can play <em>Doom</em> \u2013 a graphics-intensive computer game requiring split-second decision-making \u2013 over the internet without downloading it. Even on an old Macbook Air, the lag is barely noticeable. All you need is a fast internet connection.</p>\n<p>This feat is being achieved on a daily basis by a Moscow-headquartered startup called <a href=\"http://PlayKey.net/\" target=\"_blank\">PlayKey</a>. Users pay a fee to connect to the company\u2019s servers, which hosts its wide selection of game titles. The gamer\u2019s commands are sent from a personal computer to the server and back. It is like streaming a show on Netflix \u2013 except you dictate what happens in the story.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re trying to move everything to the cloud,\u201d Egor Gurjev, co-founder and CEO of PlayKey tells <em>Tech in Asia</em>.</p>\n<p>PlayKey is seeing traction on the business side too. While the five-year-old company is not profitable yet because it is investing money in expansion, it claims to be seeing strong growth:</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-432257\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Playkey_metrics.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"557\"></p>\n<p>To be sure, PlayKey is not the only game in town. GeForce Now, LiquidSky, and PlayStation Now offer similar experiences.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s no certainty this form of \u201ccloud gaming\u201d will become mainstream.\u00a0 These services may face a common obstacle: Imagine needing to purchase a movie on top of paying a monthly fee just to watch it on Netflix. That is the current situation with cloud gaming, and game publishers are unlikely to budge.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey like the transactional model, and only a few games are sold on a subscription,\u201d says Gurjev. Yet, he adds that users still get cost savings from not needing to purchase a brand new computer just to play the latest titles.</p>\n<p>PlayKey thinks it has another ace up its sleeve: the blockchain. Running a game streaming service is costly because of the specialized servers needed. Amazon Web Services will not do.</p>\n<p>To serve its users, PlayKey leases over a hundred <a href=\"http://www.nvidia.com/object/grid-technology.html\" target=\"_blank\">Nvidia Grid</a> servers \u2013 which are ideal for graphics-intensive applications \u2013 in four spots around the world. It\u2019s planning a fifth location in Singapore that will cater to Asians.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-432328\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-04-at-12.02.24-AM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"645\" height=\"210\"></p>\n<p>The blockchain could eliminate the need for centralized servers entirely. Gurjev envisions a global decentralized network involving two groups of people: gamers and miners. Gamers pay miners PlayKey\u2019s unique digital tokens \u2013 called PKTs \u2013 in order to access their computers.</p>\n<p>If enough miners come on board, gamers would be able to stream from a computer that is in their neighborhood. As a result, PlayKey can expand without investing in physical infrastructure. Gamers get a better experience with close proximity to a server. Miners earn PKTs for serving gamers, and the tokens can be exchanged for Ethereum and other currencies.</p>\n<p>A crucial piece of this network \u2013 which will be built on top of the public Ethereum blockchain \u2013 is the smart contract between miner and gamer.</p>\n<p>Miners need to ensure a smooth performance for gamers in order to get the tokens, and the smart contract enforces that by automatically tracking video frame rates, disconnections, and other data. For a start, the company plans to approach professional cryptocurrency miners first because they already have the rigs set up.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey won\u2019t switch off their PCs if somebody is playing on them,\u201d says Gurjev.</p>\n<h2>Upending the gaming ecosystem</h2>\n<p>To raise funds for this network, PlayKey is preparing for an initial coin offering (ICO), which is slated to start on November 1.</p>\n<p>Gurjev wants to outdo typical ICOs by giving potential investors more than just a whitepaper to sink their teeth into. Already, his team of 45 people has built a working prototype in which a gamer can pay the miner tokens and play games reliably on the remote computer. Now, they are looking to scale this up to more users and computers, and allow people to access the system without assistance.</p>\n<p>If PlayKey succeeds, it can eat into the hardware industry. After all, why splurge on a Razer gaming laptop if your beat-up Macbook can play the latest games at maximum graphics settings without missing a beat?</p>\n<p>\u201cWe believe there is no need to buy expensive or power computers, especially if you\u2019re a gamer who only plays several hours a week,\u201d says Gurjev.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_432324\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-432324\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Egor_Grujev_CEO_Playkey.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"590\" height=\"332\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Egor Grujev, co-founder and CEO of PlayKey.

It plans to set up the <a href=\"http://playkey.io/\" target=\"_blank\">PlayKey Foundation</a>, which will fund itself by acting as a toll gate for the entire network. The money will be used to develop an ecosystem of game publishers and developers, competitive gamers, as well as esports enthusiasts.</p>\n<p>A game publisher would be able to sell a new product directly within the PlayKey network to miners, who would then attract gamers with the latest titles.</p>\n<p>In other words, it could disrupt existing games publishers and distributors like Blizzard, Steam, and Valve, who require users to download games onto personal devices.</p>\n<p>And let us not forget the other big elephants in the room: PlayStation and Xbox.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe next generation of [gaming] consoles could be the last one that is based on hardware,\u201d says Gurjev.</p>", "spider_name": "techinasia", "id": "techinasia_432323", "has_funding_news": 0.3527678847312927}

I loved it, and it\u2019s where I found my passion in tech, building companies, and supporting founders.</p>\n<h2><strong>How did you get into Silicon Valley?</strong></h2>\n<p>I heard about this program where Apple would hire kids in college. They called it the Apple Campus Rep Program, where you help do the promotion, evangelism, and sales on campus. I knew that was something that I\u2019d be passionate about, but they didn\u2019t have a role in my region. So, I had to fight tooth and nail and find a way into the company. I told them that whether they give me a business card or not, I\u2019m going to do the job regardless.</p>\n<p>I was fortunate enough to get enrolled with them in college. But they weren\u2019t very good at transitioning their college \u201cfarm team,\u201d if you will, where they were breeding and incubating all of us to the actual mothership in Cupertino. So, I couldn\u2019t find my way in. I thought that well, if they\u2019re not going to let me in, I\u2019m going to show up.</p>\n<p>So, I drove across the country but did not get the job that I wanted to interview with at Apple. I was interviewing at Google, Facebook, and other places like small startups. I didn\u2019t know anyone and I was sleeping on the couch of a friend of a friend. I finally found my way into a small never-heard-of startup. I got into pretty good debt on credit cards and such at this time because I just kind of knew in my head that I had to be there. I just had this feeling that I was going to be in tech for the rest of my life, and that I just had to go to the mecca.</p>\n<p>Then, I was able to dig myself out. The company folded in a year, but that\u2019s actually a really good experience to go through early on. Certainly, one of the things I can recommend to people is to have both corporate and startup experience.</p>\n<p>But I think it\u2019s really good to start in a small business right out of school because you\u2019ll be forced to wear so many hats. You\u2019ll be given so much responsibility at a young age. In corporates, you have to specialize quite early and won\u2019t generally get much responsibility.</p>\n<p>I went to startups, then back to Apple, a big company, then back to startups. I highly recommend that kind of transition process. Start in a small company to cut your teeth, then go to a corporate later to learn some bigger skills.</p>\n<h2><strong>What was your experience at Apple like?</strong></h2>\n<p>I went back to Apple in 2008 where I was involved in building the small to medium business division. This helped me learn not only how to lead at a company like Apple but also the ability to build a division and deal with VCs and tech companies as your customers. A lot of them became my friends and mentors, and, obviously, I\u2019m still very close to a lot of them today.</p>\n<p>I left Apple when I was around 28 years old, and this is when a lot of my family members and friends were scratching their heads.\u00a0Everything was going well with me at Apple.\u00a0I had the number one reporting team globally in my division. I was living in Silicon Valley, my favorite place in the world. I loved my team and customers. I was making the most money I\u2019ve ever made. Apple was on the rise.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t know how to completely describe it, but I just realized that the future is looking like the most boring thing for me. I thought I was just going to sit in that office, climb the corporate ladder, make a bunch of money, and it would be cool. But I already saw it. It was very clear what that kind of life looked like for me.</p>\n<p>I quit and started consulting with VCs and startups. At this time, my college sweetheart and I got back together, and she had this itch to go to Asia. I was consulting in tech startups, and I thought that tech startups and VCs are everywhere, so why not try Asia? I got myself a one-way ticket with my wife three and a half years ago and started building Brinc, where we support hardware startup founders around the world.</p>\n<h2><strong>How did the idea for a hardware accelerator come about?</strong></h2>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t some brilliant plan, but\u00a0I knew that hardware or connecting the physical world was a really massive opportunity. I thought that the epicenter of power when it comes to internet of things (IoT) would be China.</p>\n<p>I actually tried raising funds, and thank goodness I didn\u2019t follow up on that. I didn\u2019t think I would make a very good banker. I realized that the opportunity was more about supporting the complexity founders go through on a daily basis. How can we keep supporting the next generation of entrepreneurs who will be connecting the physical world to the internet, unlocking the world\u2019s data to improve lives? I thought that if I could be a small part of that, I think it\u2019s going to be really, really big.</p>\n<p>So, it wasn\u2019t some master plan, but three and a half years later, here we are.</p>\n<h2><strong>What do you guys do at Brinc exactly?</strong></h2>\n<p>We started out as an accelerator, but it\u2019s like a life cycle.</p>\n<p>We realized that there are a lot of things we can help people learn remotely. So, we acquired a company called Enter China recently. It\u2019s an online community with 300 hardware startup founders that are learning together every day how to validate ideas, recognize a good idea, manufacture, launch an online campaign, pre-orders, or crowdfunding, and all the things you need to know to get started.</p>\n<p>We have our global, online, and remote IoT accelerators. You can stay where you are to validate; you don\u2019t have to spend money traveling. Don\u2019t quit your life because our cohorts are open right now. Live your life, build your company, and stay where you are.</p>\n<p>Our drone accelerator is one of our verticals. We also have a new accelerator we just launched a couple of weeks ago for later-stage companies who want to enter the Chinese market.</p>\n<p>For those who are ready to make their products, we have our studio.</p>\n<h2><strong>What trends in hardware excite you now?</strong></h2>\n<p>There are three areas that excite me personally. The first is health technology. I think we have over half of our investments there. You have to invest in and understand the data that your body is telling you.\u00a0We\u2019re the first generation that can take a clinical-grade blood pressure reading or blood analysis in our homes. So, for me, health tech is a massive trend, and we\u2019re going to see more and more clinical-grade testing done in homes.</p>\n<p>The second one is agriculture technology, as we actually have to make sure that there\u2019s enough food and water supply in the world. We\u2019re really looking into how to protect the world\u2019s resources and how to create more food.</p>\n<p>The third one is around drones. I really didn\u2019t think the idea of a drone program made any sense, but when we started looking at the applications we received from 800 people, my mind exploded.</p>\n<p><em>Read more from this series\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/tag/tia-x-jks\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</em></p>", "spider_name": "techinasia", "id": "techinasia_432189", "has_funding_news": 0.4899407625198364}

Read more from star contributors <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/tag/star-contributor\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</i></p>\n<p>Google AdWords is one of the strongest marketing tools in a digital marketer\u2019s arsenal. However, it is also most likely to rack up your ad spend without giving you the returns. Unlike other PPC marketing channels such as Facebook and Instagram, Google AdWords is highly technical and will require far more tweaking.</p>\n<p>On the bright side, it is also most likely to give you high conversion rates, as it is based on search intent. Yup, users are searching for your keywords because they are looking for your exact product/service.</p>\n<p>As the founder of a <a href=\"https://ambercreative.sg/what-we-do/google-adwords-agency-singapore/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Google AdWords agency</a>, here are some lessons I\u2019ve learned from our clients\u2019 campaigns.</p>\n<h2><b>1. You may not be using the right keywords</b></h2>\n<p>The most relevant keywords to use are the products/services themselves. However, these generally won\u2019t be enough to run the entire campaign.</p>\n<p>For example, when we were running preschool campaigns for our client, we ran not just the keyword \u201cpreschool,\u201d but \u201cpreschool Singapore,\u201d \u201cSingapore preschool,\u201d and more. While certain keywords like \u201ckindergarten\u201d and \u201cchildcare\u201d might seem related, they are not directly relevant. After experimenting with these for a while, we turned them off, as they did not produce results.</p>\n<h2><b>2. Too many keywords in a single ad group affects quality score</b></h2>\n<p>Google\u2019s <a href=\"https://adwords.google.com/home/tools/keyword-planner/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Keyword Planner</a> is a great tool to explore and expand on your existing keywords. However, don\u2019t go trigger happy and add every keyword that Google proposes! Having too many in an ad group means that your ad copy won\u2019t match your keywords exactly, which causes a low <a href=\"https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/2454010?co=ADWORDS.IsAWNCustomer%3Dfalse&amp;hl=en\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">quality score</a>.</p>\n<p>Why is your quality score important? As we\u2019ve experienced, a good quality score means that ads will appear higher in searches and cost less, while a poor one will make ads cost more to appear.</p>\n<p>The quality score is comprised of your ad\u2019s:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Click-through rate</li>\n<li>Keyword relevance to the ad group</li>\n<li>Landing page quality and relevance</li>\n<li>Ad text relevance</li>\n<li>Historical AdWords account performance</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While it makes sense to have only one or two keywords per ad group for razor-sharp targeting, it can be too much work to manage. I\u2019d recommend no more than 10 keywords per ad group.</p>\n<p>We tested this with one of our clients\u2019 campaigns and it did result in a 63 percent lower cost per click. If you\u2019re interested, the full case study can be found <a href=\"https://ambercreative.sg/case-studies/case-study-mindchamps-digital-marketing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2><b>3. Using negative keywords</b></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/105671?hl=en\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Negative keywords</a> are super critical in managing ad spend, especially when you use a lot of broad keywords. While broad keywords give you more impressions and clicks, it also has the potential to give you a lot of irrelevant searches.</p>\n<p>For example, if we were advertising with the message \u201cBuy Apple iPhone\u201d in our shop, we could be showing up for keywords like Apple Hotline, Apple Support, etc., which doesn\u2019t make sense. Negative keywords could then include \u201chotline\u201d and \u201csupport,\u201d so you don\u2019t pay for irrelevant searches!</p>\n<h2><b>4. Sending traffic to the wrong landing page</b></h2>\n<p>A very common mistake we\u2019ve noticed from campaigns is sending all traffic to the website instead of the most relevant landing page. This causes the company\u2019s ad quality scores to dip because the home page is not directly relevant to their ads\u2019 messages. For example, if your website sells clothes and people search for \u201ckids clothing,\u201d they should be sent directly to the kid\u2019s section.</p>\n<p>Another possibility is to send traffic to a dedicated landing page. We tried this with one of our clients who had a special promotion for their new bridal collection. We created a landing page dedicated to this new collection using <a href=\"https://instapage.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Instapage</a>, then linked their \u201cLatest Bridal Collection\u201430% off Wedding Gowns\u201d ad to this page instead of their main website. Within the page, we also incorporated the same keywords used for the ads.</p>\n<h2><b>5. Your landing page may need improvement</b></h2>\n<p>We\u2019ve also noticed that some digital marketers focus on improving their ads and forget about the landing page experience. It is crucial to have a landing page that is mobile optimized, loads quickly, and has coherent, appealing, and relevant content, as this will impact your ad\u2019s quality score.</p>\n<p>Getting professionals to create beautiful and user-friendly landing pages can be a great investment. Also, testing your landing pages is a good way to see what kinds of messages appeal more to your audience. Below is an example of two variations of the same page. Notice how one page emphasizes the urgency to enroll your child into a preschool, while the other explains why their preschool is exceptional?</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-432078\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Sample-Landing-Page.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1560\" height=\"286\"></p>\n<h2><b>6. Don\u2019t ignore ad extensions</b></h2>\n<p>Ad extensions are extremely useful in encouraging your customers to take action and can help your ad take up more real estate on the search page. Bigger ads are more prominent. Therefore, they are more likely to get clicked.</p>\n<p>So, start getting familiar with the types of ad extensions, such as call, site-link, callout, location extensions, and more, and use them whenever appropriate for your business. Here is an example of how site-link and call extensions look. See how much more space the ad takes?</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_432086\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter text-center\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-432086\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/6.-Ad-extensions.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"373\" height=\"258\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Call extension, callout extensions, and site-link extensions.</p>\n</div>\n<h2><b>7. Testing your ad copies</b></h2>\n<p>From my experience, I know that people find testing quite a hassle. But I have to tell you, it definitely reaps benefits in the long run. Nobody can tell you how well your ads may perform, so this is where testing is important.</p>\n<p>To do this, you can start by creating ads with the same body texts but different titles, and vice versa. So, your ads can look something like this:</p>\n<p><img class=\"text-center aligncenter wp-image-432093\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Sample-Ad-Copy.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"653\" height=\"115\"></p>\n<p>Let your ads run, and once they get between 20 to 40 clicks, review them again and choose the best performing ones. Try not to be biased toward any ad copy and be ready to let go of that super creative ad you love.</p>\n<h2><b>8. Testing optimal ad positions</b></h2>\n<p>If your campaign\u2019s objective is to generate awareness, then being at the top of the search page is desirable. But, if you are looking to drive conversions, research shows that the third to fifth positions are best. So, start testing for the optimal position by adjusting your CPC bids. Sometimes, a cheaper ad with a lower position can give better results than a more expensive one.</p>\n<h2><b>Ending remarks</b></h2>\n<p>If this is all too much information, here are the three main things you need to remember to run an effective AdWords campaign:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>An organized campaign is an effective one</strong>. Organize relevant keywords into ads and relevant ads into ad groups. Lastly, link the ad groups to specific landing pages.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Get familiar with AdWords</strong>. There are plenty of smart ways to use AdWords to help you achieve your goals, such as targeting strategies, ad extensions, and other useful tools. I wrote an article titled \u201c<a href=\"https://ambercreative.sg/5-smart-ways-use-google-adwords/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">5 Smart Ways to Use Google AdWords</a>\u201d with some tips to do these.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Have clear objectives</strong>. Whether it is to generate awareness or drive conversions, being clear about your campaign\u2019s goals and your target audience can help save unnecessary spending.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>All the best with AdWords!</p>", "spider_name": "techinasia", "id": "techinasia_432063", "has_funding_news": 0.146811380982399}

The length of the overall process depends on each case and how complex the deal is.</p>\n<p><img class=\"text-center aligncenter wp-image-432157\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/1KhruCAP7Vaz4JgRY9NxQeQ.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"501\" height=\"751\"></p>\n<h2><b>Term sheet</b></h2>\n<p>If a VC wants to invest in your company after the assessment phase,\u00a0he will first send you a term sheet.</p>\n<h3><b>Term sheet negotiation</b></h3>\n<p>In this post, I won\u2019t tell you how to read or negotiate a term sheet since it\u2019s a very technical topic. The best way not to fuck up is to do it together with a trusted and experienced lawyer. You should also request the help of other founders who have been through this experience.</p>\n<p>For those who don\u2019t know, a term sheet is a \u201cnon-binding document meant to record two or more parties\u2019 intentions to enter into a future agreement based on specified (but incomplete or preliminary) terms.\u201d This is the document which lays the foundation for the future terms and conditions that will appear in the final contract. In it, you\u2019ll generally find the amount the VC wants to invest, the valuation of your company for this round, and the types of shares they will get.</p>\n<p>The crucial aspect to keep in mind is that a term sheet is a <em>non-binding agreement. </em>So,\u00a0if for various reasons you or the VC decides against the investment, the deal won\u2019t be concluded. Know that VCs do cancel investments for no good reason even after they\u2019ve issued a term sheet. This is clearly bad behavior, and you should avoid this kind of investor.</p>\n<p>That being said, there are also some good reasons for an investor not to pursue a deal after they\u2019ve sent a term sheet. For example, this can happen when they discover some legal issues during the due diligence phase which were not initially shared by the founders.</p>\n<p>Here are some useful resources:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://feld.com/archives/2005/08/term-sheet-series-wrap-up.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Term Sheet Series Wrap Up</a> by Brad Feld</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://pawel.posthaven.com/why-liquidation-preferences-can-make-your-startup-worse\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Why Liquidation Preferences Can Make Your Startup Worse</a> by Pawel Chudzinski</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://venturehacks.com/articles/term-sheet-hacks\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Term Sheet Hacks: Get a Great Deal</a>\u00a0by Venture Hacks</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><b>VC due diligence</b></h3>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/talk/vc-analyst-preparing-fundraise\" rel=\"nofollow\">part two</a> of this series, I recommended you to do reference checks on the VCs you shortlisted. Now that you\u2019re so close to finalizing your deal with an investor, you should clear the last questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If there\u2019s an aspect that the VC promotes and is important for you, ask more about it. Don\u2019t hesitate to ask for concrete examples of companies that have benefited from their contributions.</li>\n<li>Don\u2019t hesitate to do more reference checks and speak with the founders in their portfolio. You can ask the VC to introduce you to the ones you want to talk to.</li>\n<li>Ask yourself if you trust the investor, as trusting them is extremely important. If the fund is great, but you don\u2019t get along with your investor, it\u2019s better to be open about it and to back out if needed.</li>\n<li>Ask the VCs what they do when a portfolio company doesn\u2019t do well.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve chosen the investors you want to work with and have negotiated and signed their term sheet, it\u2019s time to move to the next phase: deal finalization.</p>\n<h2><b>Deal finalization</b></h2>\n<h3><b>Startup due diligence</b></h3>\n<p>Due diligence is simply the process of checking a particular aspect of a deal. Let\u2019s say the success of your company depends heavily on a unique piece of technology that you patented. Before investing in you, the investor needs to check if everything was done properly and if you\u2019re the real owner of this patent.</p>\n<p>The due diligence process can cover many aspects: legal, technological, or human resources. These are assessed by external agencies or by an in-house team. At the early stage, the due diligence process is usually light.</p>\n<p>Note: Some investors prefer to conduct the legal and business due diligence\u00a0before offering a term sheet.</p>\n<h3><b>Contract agreement</b></h3>\n<p>This is obvious, but I think it should be worth reiterating here. Before signing any contract, you should understand it well and negotiate any term that you don\u2019t feel comfortable with. It has to be done with a lawyer who has experience with this kind of work.</p>\n<h3><b>How long does it take to go from term sheet to signed contract?</b></h3>\n<p>It can vary greatly. It can take a couple of weeks if the deal is simple and all parties are quickly aligned. But it can also take months for a complex deal, those that require heavy due diligence, legal restructuring, and aligning with many investors.</p>\n<p><em>This article was first published on <a href=\"https://medium.com/point-nine-news/an-early-stage-founders-guide-to-working-with-vcs-from-term-sheet-to-signed-deal-9f536e063488\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Medium</a>.</em></p>", "spider_name": "techinasia", "id": "techinasia_432122", "has_funding_news": 0.21266041696071625}

At the same time, local governments and organizations in China have been opening their doors to foreign tech talent.</p>\n<p>The Nordic region, whose combined population roughly equals Shanghai, has seen an increasing amount of cross-border activity with China. <a href=\"http://www.slush.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Slush</a>, a volunteer-run startup conference born out of Helsinki, Finland, launched its first conference in China last year. 2016 also saw Tencent\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/tencent-acquires-supercell-for-real-this-time-no-really-seriously-for-real\">US$8.6 billion</a> acquisition of Finnish gaming company Supercell, maker of <em>Clash of Clans.</em></p>\n<p>The Chinese tech giant was also rumored to have approached Swedish unicorn Spotify for acquisition earlier this year before being rebuffed, according to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/15/spotify-tencent/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>TechCrunch</em></a>.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">We want to bring Nordic companies first to Shanghai, then to China, and then to Asia.</blockquote>\n<p>\u201cWe want to bring Nordic companies first to Shanghai, then to China, and then to Asia,\u201d says St<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00f8</span>.</p>\n<p>NHack plans to open a series of vertical-focused accelerators in China, including Beijing and Hangzhou. nHack\u2019s Shenzhen accelerator, which is slated to launch next March, will focus on smart hardware and IoT. St<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00f8</span> says the accelerator is aiming to bring in 30 startups each quarter.</p>\n<p>In addition to mentorship, the accelerator will help companies connect with the right partners, whether they\u2019re looking to crowdfund, find investors, or optimize their production process. NHack is also mainly focusing on companies that have raised funding before. In fact, most of its first cohort has a product, such as underwater drone company <a href=\"https://www.blueyerobotics.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Blueye Robotics</a> \u2013 which has already nabbed funding from local investors in China.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not so interesting from zero to one,\u201d says Chris Rynning, partner and co-founder at nHack, who has lived in China for 20 years. \u201cBut once you have a paying customer, you go from one to 100 in value creation.\u201d The goal of nHack, he explains, is not to focus on pre-seed or seed stage startups, but on companies that are ready to find customers, scale their business, or iterate on the next generation of their product through rapid prototyping.</p>\n<p>Currently, nHack is partnering with <a href=\"http://www.innovasjonnorge.no/en/start-page/\" target=\"_blank\">Innovation Norway</a>, a commercial arm of the Norwegian government, and Danish bank Danske Bank. Both entities are sponsoring and funding nHack\u2019s accelerator program and investment fund. In China, the accelerator is a partner of WeWork and cooperates with Slush China.</p>", "spider_name": "techinasia", "id": "techinasia_432060", "has_funding_news": 0.23516477644443512}

But there are also lessons they can glean from\u00a0an internationally acclaimed satirical TV show called Silicon Valley.</p>\n<p>The series is inspired by real-life tech culture, with creator/executive producer Mike Judge having worked as an engineer and lived in the real Silicon Valley in Southern California. Even the show\u2019s star, Thomas Middleditch, who plays the brainy software engineer Richard Hendricks in the show, says he grew up as a nerd in British Columbia \u201cplaying copious amounts of video games and creating some websites.\u201d</p>\n<p>To maintain its authenticity, the show\u2019s writers and producers do research trips to the tech hub to get further observations on the real-life interactions in the startup scene.</p>\n<p>So, here are some useful lessons we can learn from the show.</p>\n<h2><strong>1. Don\u2019t sell immediately</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe class=\"giphy-embed\" src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/3osxYamKD88c6pXdfO\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Don\u2019t be too quick to take the allure of an early, big-money buyout. In the series, Hendricks is offered US$4 million for his company, Pied Piper. He is tempted by a quick exit strategy, but he eventually takes a different investment route to keep control of his company and aim for a bigger goal.</p>\n<p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Figure out your exit strategy from the get-go and set your goals. Did you build your startup to help people and change the world? Or do you just want to make money? Don\u2019t immediately sell when you get your first big offer.</p>\n<h2><strong>2. It may not be easy to let a new leader take over</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe class=\"giphy-embed\" src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/3oEdv7vedu6iAZoqTS\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Startup founders can be brilliant, almost like shooting stars. But as a high-tech company evolves, an even more experienced executive may need to take the company to the next level. In the show, Hendricks was replaced by a seasoned veteran with the suggestion that \u201cfiring a young CEO and installing a much more experienced one looks like leadership.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Lesson:</strong> A rapid success and expansion may mean looking for outside talent who can help you with your startup\u2019s growing needs. But realize that, in a competitive marketplace, other companies are also looking to bring in leaders with similar skills, and any change in your company\u2019s leadership may involve power struggles and conflicts. So, if your startup needs a new leader, you also need to maintain a shared purpose.</p>\n<h2><strong>3. A verbal agreement is not a formal deal</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe class=\"giphy-embed\" src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/3og0IG0vkIQpuJoLvO\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>A verbal agreement may not be a deal yet. In the fourth season of the show, Hendricks hands over control of Piper Chat (the former Pied Piper has turned into a video chat app) to a talented programmer. They have a verbal agreement about the access to the company\u2019s database, but the programmer blocks him and all former employees saying, \u201cWe had an agreement, not a deal.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Lesson</strong>: You cannot rely on verbal agreements. Once you have your eureka moment with your innovative idea, document it, open a Dropbox account, and save your documentation there. If you have partners, all co-founders should sign a thorough agreement that defines the relationship of the founders with each other and include a conflict-resolution clause to avoid conflict.</p>\n<h2><strong>4.

For the full interview, go\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.disruptingjapan.com/japan-laundry-folding-robot-startup/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</em></p>\n<p>Google\u2019s driverless cars, IBM\u2019s Watson, and other such projects have pushed the limits of what\u2019s possible and have introduced astounding innovations in AI over the past few years. But sometimes, it\u2019s surprising to take a look at the kinds of problems that are extremely difficult for AI to solve. It turns out that folding laundry is one of these problems.</p>\n<p>I spoke with Seven Dreamers CEO Shin Sakane, who invented the Laundroid. This is the first commercially available, fully automatic laundry-folding robot. We talk about AI in general and what his firm had to go through to make the robot a reality.</p>\n<h2><b>What is the Laundroid?</b></h2>\n<p>We\u2019ve been working on this project for the last 12 years. This robot folds clothes and separates them by categories or by family members.</p>\n<p>The key feature of the robot is that after you dry your clothes, you can just put them into the insert box at the bottom. Then, with artificial intelligence, robotics, and vision analysis technology, the robot arm picks up the clothes one by one and folds and puts them in the pickup box. If you choose to separate by clothing category, the robot puts towels in the towel tray and shirts in the shirt tray.</p>\n<p>If you want to separate the clothes by family members, you have to do a one-time registration process for each family member.</p>\n<h2><b>Why is this a hard problem for AI?</b></h2>\n<p>It was not that hard to develop a robot to just fold shirts, towels, and pants, for example. It took us about three years to achieve that. The hardest part was that the robot had to pick up one piece of clothing, reorganize if it\u2019s a shirt, a pair of pants, or a towel, and then reorganize if it\u2019s upside down, flipped, or something like that. It also has to place the clothing in a certain location in order to start folding. That\u2019s the hardest part.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s so easy for human beings, but it\u2019s so hard for robots and artificial intelligence.</p>\n<h2><b>What are the robot\u2019s limitations?</b></h2>\n<p>It can fold pretty much all the regular clothes including shirts, long-sleeved shirts, pants, shorts, and towels. But there are three things the Laundroid can\u2019t do. One is flipping clothes inside out. The second thing is closing buttons. Polo shirts are OK since the buttons don\u2019t have to be done for them to be folded. But there are shirts that you have to close at least three buttons for the robot to fold them properly.</p>\n<p>The third thing that the robot can\u2019t do\u2014but that it can do within a year\u2014is pairing socks. This is kind of funny, but it\u2019s so hard, you know? It could do this, but it will probably make a lot of mistakes. For example, it sometimes pairs very dark\u00a0navy blue socks with black socks.</p>\n<h2><b>Tell us a little bit about yourself</b></h2>\n<p>After I got a PhD in the US, I came back to Japan in January 2000 with a 30-year plan to grow a business. In the first 15 years, my aim was to learn.</p>\n<p>I had different choices, of course. I was able to work for Sony, Panasonic, and Toyota, for example. But my father also started his own company back in 1983. He was very successful and wanted me to join the company, but I was always rejecting him. But after I got my PhD and came back to Japan, I realized that maybe the best place I could learn the most was at my father\u2019s company. So, I apologized and said, \u201cCan I join your company?\u201d And he said, \u201cOK, sure.\u201d</p>\n<p>I started my business career at his company. He created a new group and I became the head there and was luckily successful.</p>\n<p>In 2003, my father thought that I could run the company, so I became the CEO and ran the company for eight years. In 2010, we already had the base technology for Laundroid.</p>\n<h2><b>Do you have plans to use the data you collect?</b></h2>\n<p>The Laundroid remembers who wears what and how often, right? Of course, we have to keep perfect control of the privacies. We don\u2019t sell private information, but we can connect business to business using this data. For example, apparel makers like Uniqlo know what kind of clothes they sell at each store, but they don\u2019t know how long these clothes were used and how often they were worn. So, we are probably going to be the only ones who know all this. I\u2019m sure this has certain value.</p>\n<h2><b>What is your motivation to go global so quickly?</b></h2>\n<p>One of the reasons is that I really hate Japanese companies to be always domestic. I think we can expand globally and I want to prove it. Even small startup companies can go global and expand. I lived in the US for several years, so I know that even great companies like Google and Apple expand globally immediately when they launch a new product.</p>\n<p>But Japanese inventions stay here all the time, which I really hate. That\u2019s one of the reasons. The second is because my goal for 2030 is to have a revenue of US$3.5 billion with a profit margin of 20 percent. That\u2019s the goal I set in 2000.</p>\n<h2><b>Do you think Japan is faring well in robotics?</b></h2>\n<p>I think we\u2019ll be OK, definitely. We\u2019re not going to completely lose, but when the demand was for industrial robots, we were pretty good just because it was a lot of mechanics and electronics, which we are really, really good at. But nowadays, robots have to go together with the software and artificial intelligence. I don\u2019t think Japan is so good with these kinds of algorithms and software. Our speed of developing technologies is relatively slow as well, so it\u2019s not going to be easy to be competitive.</p>\n<h2><b>If you could change one thing about Japan, what would it be?</b></h2>\n<p>One is that we want Japan to know that they can do it. They can innovate. They can expand globally quickly. And once they do it, I\u2019m sure many young people will follow. The second thing is that I want someone to change the education system completely. This is really, really bad in Japan. Teachers have no experiences abroad. How can people teach about global experiences without having global experiences? It\u2019s impossible.</p>\n<p><em>Read more from this series\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/tag/tia-x-dj\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</em></p>", "spider_name": "techinasia", "id": "techinasia_431868", "has_funding_news": 0.402631551027298}

And the most surprising discovery is that more than half of them pursued a non-tech major.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s take a look at the findings.</p>\n<h2><strong>75% are non-tech degree holders</strong></h2>\n<p><img title=\"What Did Most Founders Study\" src=\"https://d1vfs9f7h1rfk4.cloudfront.net/media/Ben/2_What_Did_Most_Founders_Study.png\" alt=\"What Did Most Founders Study\"></p>\n<p>It\u2019s quite a surprise to find that only 25 percent of founders in Singapore have a degree in computer science, computer engineering, computing, or IT. This group includes Burpple CTO Daniel Hum, Carousell CTO Lucas Ngoo, and MoneySmart co-founder Timothy Kua.</p>\n<p>What did the rest study then? Most of them have a degree in\u00a0engineering (30), economics (19), and business (12), while others studied\u00a0law, commerce, finance, and even history, among other non-tech majors.</p>\n<p>Some startup heads who have an engineering degree are Fave co-founder\u00a0Chen Chow Yeoh, Grab COO\u00a0Tan Hooi Ling, and\u00a0PropertyGuru co-founder Jani Rautiainen. Meanwhile, some of those who studied economics are\u00a0Grab CEO Anthony Tan, Honestbee CEO Joel Sng, and Active.ai CEO Ravi Shankar.</p>\n<p>Findings also show that you can still establish a successful startup even if you have a \u201cless conventional\u201d degree. Take note of these examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lunch Actually CEO Violet Lim took up law.</li>\n<li>MC Payment managing director Moon Soo Kim is an English Literature graduate.</li>\n<li>Clozette\u2019s business development lead, Cheryl Tan, studied Chinese and Japanese languages.</li>\n<li>GoCoin co-founder Brock Pierce got a degree in film at the University of Southern California.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>See also:\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/talk/startup-founders-philippines-not-study-tech\" rel=\"nofollow\">Successful founders in the Philippines did not study tech, says this research</a></strong></p>\n<p>Meanwhile, some founders hold a degree relevant to their startup\u2019s product. For example,\u00a0Dawn Soo, the COO of DocDoc, studied medicine at the Imperial College London, and Farouk Meralli, CEO of mClinica, got his degree in biomedical sciences at McGill University.</p>\n<h2>40 founders attended NUS</h2>\n<p><img title=\"Universities That Produced The Most Founders\" src=\"https://d1vfs9f7h1rfk4.cloudfront.net/media/Ben/1_Universities_That_Produced_The_Most_Founders.png\" alt=\"Universities That Produced The Most Founders\">The university that birthed the highest number of startup founders is National University of Singapore (NUS) with 40 founders, such as Be My Guest CEO Clement Wong and Ninja Van CTO Shaun Chong. NUS is followed by Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and Singapore Management University (SMU) with six and four founders, respectively. Founders from these two schools include M-Daq CEO Richard Koh and HipVan\u2019s head of operations, Deborah Wee.</p>\n<p>Standing between NUS and NTU, however, is Harvard University with nine startup founders. Grab founders Anthony Tan and Tan Hooi Ling both attended Harvard Business School for their MBAs.</p>\n<h2><strong>More founders studied abroad than in Singapore</strong></h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" title=\"Did They Study Locally or Abroad\" src=\"https://d1vfs9f7h1rfk4.cloudfront.net/media/Ben/3_Did_They_Study_Locally_or_Abroad.png\" alt=\"Did They Study Locally or Abroad\"><br>\nInterestingly, the research shows that there are more founders who studied abroad than in Singapore. Although NUS produced the highest number of startup founders, a staggering total of 114 founders completed their bachelor\u2019s degrees overseas compared to 46 founders who hold local certifications.</p>\n<p>These 114 founders studied in the US (Purdue University,\u00a0University of California Los Angeles, Cornell University, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute), the UK (University of Cambridge), Australia (Monash University), South Korea (Seoul National University), Austria (University of Salzburg), and Italy (Sapienza University of Rome).</p>\n<p>There are also some founders who stayed in Singapore for their bachelor\u2019s degree and got their master\u2019s degree or MBA at a foreign university. Anuj Bheda, co-founder of 99.co, is an example. He<b>\u00a0</b>is a computer engineering degree holder who attended NTU, then furthered his studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p>\n<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>\n<p>These findings show that one does not always need a degree in technology, IT, computer science, or the like to build a successful startup company. An understanding of the market, the right team, and the drive are often enough to make it out alive of the great startup race in Southeast Asia.</p>", "spider_name": "techinasia", "id": "techinasia_429931", "has_funding_news": 0.4486294090747833}

However, through my role as a community manager, I\u2019ve still encountered situations in which founders were clueless and unprepared before and after pitching.</p>\n<p>Having coordinated the <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/category/online-segments\" rel=\"nofollow\">online pitch</a> segment on <em>Tech in Asia</em> and the speed dating sessions at our meetups, I\u2019d like to share some of my tips for new founders looking to pitch to investors.</p>\n<h2>Before the pitch</h2>\n<h3>Research</h3>\n<p>Research is important when pitching to investors. Most founders fail to do this\u2014they use the same pitch for every investor they come across. Finding out who you\u2019re pitching to and why they\u2019re the best investors for you is key.</p>\n<p>Here are a few questions to ask yourself:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Does the investor understand and is interested in my startup\u2019s specific vertical?</li>\n<li>What can the investor bring to the table other than funding (i.e. mentorship, contacts, etc.)?</li>\n<li>Do I have statistics and an MVP to show them?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can avoid many mistakes and save time just by doing research.</p>\n<p>Before even reaching out to the investor, you could also find out if there are similar startups in their portfolio, reach out to them to ask for tips, and determine if the investor is a good fit for you. Any advice you get will better prepare you for the pitch, so never underestimate the investor\u2019s \u201cabout us\u201d page.</p>\n<p>There are also many resources online like interviews or write-ups about the investors that can help. Here\u2019s a <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/directory-of-early-stage-venture-capital-seed-funds-and-angel-investors-for-startups-in-singapore\" rel=\"nofollow\">resource list</a> of venture capital firms in Singapore, for example.</p>\n<h3>Reaching out</h3>\n<p>If you have contacts and friends who can help connect you with some investors, that\u2019s awesome. But for those who don\u2019t, here are a few avenues to reach out:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The \u201ccontact us\u201d section of their website</li>\n<li>Pitching sessions at events</li>\n<li>LinkedIn, Facebook, etc.</li>\n<li>Networking sessions</li>\n<li>Networking websites and apps</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When meeting investors face to face, don\u2019t immediately pitch to them unless the setting is conducive and they are willing to hear you out. I\u2019ve seen investors at certain events get ambushed and bombarded by founders many times. While this is a normal thing to do at networking events, it is less so at parties or celebrations.</p>\n<p>Investors are humans too, and sometimes it pays to cut them some slack and let them relax at an event. If you really have to, exchanging name cards and scheduling a time for you to call at a later date would be best.</p>\n<p>There are no hard and fast rules when approaching them. But if email is your game, it\u2019s important to note that these investors get hundreds of pitch emails a day and may not have the time to get to yours.</p>\n<p>Here are some important points:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Email titles are important. You have to catch their attention in the two to three seconds it takes to skim through an email title.</li>\n<li>Introduce yourself briefly. Your full bio isn\u2019t needed (no, really!).</li>\n<li>Drop in an elevator/one-to-two-sentence pitch.</li>\n<li>Attach a pitch deck that they can look at if they\u2019re interested (they might not see this if they\u2019re pressed for time, so your elevator pitch needs to take the cake).</li>\n<li>Thank them for their time.</li>\n<li>Pray for a reply.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Still confused? Here\u2019s an <a href=\"https://medium.com/toba-capital-blog/how-to-cold-pitch-a-vc-over-e-mail-and-actually-get-a-response-55f48ff46fa6\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">article</a> that\u2019ll help.</p>\n<p>If they don\u2019t reply after all that, it\u2019d be good to send a follow-up email after a week or so. Again, they get tons of emails a day, and it might take a while to get to yours.</p>\n<h3>Tailor the pitch</h3>\n<p>I\u2019ve seen plenty of founders use the same pitch for everyone they pitch to\u2014friends, investors, media, and clients. But, true to the points above on research, different investors look out for different qualities from a startup.</p>\n<p>There is no one-pitch-fits-all approach. However minute, pitches should be tweaked and tailored for the different investors that you\u2019re pitching to. This allows you to quell any predictable questions that may arise.</p>\n<p>Understanding who you\u2019re pitching to will help. For example, if you find out that a particular investor cares a lot about a strong team culture and a clear roadmap, be sure to reflect these in your pitch deck.</p>\n<p>Another part of tailoring the pitch is condensing your elevator pitches. As I mentioned above, keep it at one to two sentences, as this forces you to adapt to various situations and keep things short and sweet. Tweak your elevator pitch until you can explain easily and clearly what your startup is about. We enforced a one-sentence pitch rule for our online pitch sessions, which allowed participants to adapt when they pitched to different investors. Over time, we could see their one-sentence pitches improving from session to session.</p>\n<h2>After</h2>\n<h3>Feedback</h3>\n<p>Most investors are willing to help and give advice. If there\u2019s still time after a pitch, ask for additional advice on the pitch and your business. This is valuable information that can give you a clearer perspective. However, just like with most feedback, it\u2019s important to take it with a grain of salt, as it may be a single biased opinion.</p>\n<p>But from my experience, there are founders who are stubborn and are rude to naysayers. I\u2019ve spoken with founders who won\u2019t accept anything but their point of view. These founders usually get stuck and have to pivot and/or shut down in the end.</p>\n<p>Be hungry and listen. If you receive the same feedback more than once, investigate the issue, as it might be holding you back from funding. If things are still unclear after the investor gives you feedback, feel free to ask about what\u2019s missing or what can be improved.</p>\n<p>Most investors won\u2019t fault you for asking questions with regard to investments. However, this is different from being unprepared about your company and pitch.</p>\n<h3>Follow-up</h3>\n<p>I can\u2019t stress how important following up after a pitch is. After the dust has settled, send a follow-up email to thank them for taking the time to listen to your pitch.</p>\n<p>If they decide that they\u2019re not interested to invest in you, don\u2019t throw that contact away. Continue following up! Send a bi-monthly/quarterly milestone email (remember to tweak this to each investor) to remind them of your previous interaction and to update them on the changes you\u2019ve made and how things are going. This puts you top of mind and shows that you have accountability, even when you\u2019re not funded by them.\u00a0Who knows, they might just be interested in participating in your next round or even becoming your mentor.</p>\n<p>This doesn\u2019t just work for investors, but the media and prospective clients as well. Some investors have told me that it\u2019s the founders\u2019 resilience that makes them pay attention. But remember, there is a fine line between following up appropriately and being a nuisance.</p>\n<h3>Patience</h3>\n<p>Quite a fair bit of founders make the mistake of thinking that the world owes them a living and that funding comes easy. Some even get nasty and aggressive because they haven\u2019t received a reply or an answer. But if it\u2019s too easy, it\u2019s too good to be true. Getting a yes for funding doesn\u2019t happen overnight and as with any relationship, trust has to be built first.</p>\n<p>Show that you\u2019re willing to learn. If something went wrong with the pitch, establish measures to prevent such mistakes in the future. Investors won\u2019t pull the trigger without understanding the traits and characteristics of the founder. After all, attitude plays a big part in how a founder grows their company.</p>\n<p>Seek advice first, learn, and adapt. The funding will follow.</p>\n<p>I hope these points were helpful.

And worse, even if someone does manage to start something new, our management structure has so many financial, legal, and HR hurdles that every initiative needs to match our existing business financial metrics, processes, and procedures. So, we end up in paralysis by analysis\u2014moving slowly to ensure we don\u2019t make mistakes and that everyone signs off on every idea (so we can spread the collective blame if it fails). And when we do make bets, they\u2019re small bets on incremental products or acquisitions that simply add to the bottom line.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p id=\"dc0f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">Bob looked wistful.

More agile competitors are starting to eat into our business. How can we restart our innovation culture?\u201d</p>\n<h2 id=\"2fc4\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--blockquote\"><strong>What drives innovation?</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"df82\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">I pointed out to Bob the irony: In a large company, fear of failure inhibits speed and risk taking. But in a startup, it drives speed and\u00a0urgency.</p>\n<p id=\"9769\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\">If we could understand the root cause of that difference, I said, we could help Acme build a system for continuous innovation. I suggested that the best place to start the conversation was with the 21st century definition of a startup:</p>\n<blockquote><p>A startup is a temporary organization designed to\u00a0<strong>search\u00a0</strong>for a repeatable and scalable business\u00a0model.</p></blockquote>\n<p id=\"5e3a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\">Startups have finite time and resources to find product-market fit before they run out of money. Therefore, they trade off certainty for speed, adopting \u201c<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://steveblank.com/2009/04/10/good-enough-decision-making/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">good-enough decision making</a>,\u201d iterating, and pivoting as they fail, learn, and discover their business model.</p>\n<p id=\"c07f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The corollary definition for a large company is:</p>\n<blockquote><p>A company is a permanent organization\u00a0<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pullquote-strong\">designed</strong>\u00a0to\u00a0<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--pullquote-strong\">execute\u00a0</strong>a repeatable and scalable business\u00a0model.</p></blockquote>\n<p id=\"f635\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\">That means in their core business, large companies have a series of knowns:</p>\n<ul class=\"postList\">\n<li id=\"984b\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">They\u2019ve found\u00a0<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">product-market fit</strong>\u00a0(what products customers want to buy).</li>\n<li id=\"813e\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">They\u2019ve learned the best\u00a0<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">distribution channel</strong>\u00a0to get the product from their company to the customer.</li>\n<li id=\"a7ce\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">They\u2019ve figured out the\u00a0<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">revenue model</strong>\u00a0(subscription, license, direct sales, etc.) and how to price the product.</li>\n<li id=\"ec19\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">They know the\u00a0<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">activities, resources, partners</strong>\u00a0(manufacturing, regulation, IP, supply chain, etc.)\u200a, and costs to deliver the product/service. They also have\u00a0<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--li-anchor\" href=\"https://steveblank.com/2014/03/04/why-companies-are-not-startups/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">well-defined product development and product management tools</a>\u00a0that emphasize the linear nature of shipping products to existing customers.</li>\n<li id=\"3c7c\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">There are\u00a0<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">financial metrics</strong>\u00a0(ROI, hurdle rate, etc.) for new product development that emphasize immediate returns.</li>\n<li id=\"4911\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Everyone has\u00a0<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">job titles and descriptions</strong>\u00a0that describe their role in execution<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">.</strong>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"e13f\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--li\"><strong>Need for different tools, cultures, and organizations</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"0b07\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Talking to Bob, I realized that at Acme Widgets, and in most large companies, the word \u201cfailure\u201d was being used to describe two very different events:</p>\n<ul class=\"postList\">\n<li id=\"c8ae\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">Failure in\u00a0<strong>execution\u00a0</strong>of a known product in a known market</li>\n<li id=\"db78\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Failure in\u00a0<strong>searching\u00a0</strong>for innovation when there are many unknowns</li>\n</ul>\n<p id=\"afca\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">Therefore, in a large company, failure to meet a goal\u200a\u2014revenue, product delivery, service, etc.\u2014is a failure in\u00a0execution\u00a0of an individual and/or organization to perform to a\u00a0known set of success criteria. In corporations, the penalty for repeated failure on known tasks is someone being reassigned or fired.</p>\n<p id=\"5ff5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">As I sat with Bob and his innovation team, I realized that all of their company\u2019s new product innovation initiatives\u00a0were being held to the same standard as those of existing products. The company was approaching innovation and disruptive product ideas using the same processes, procedures, schedules, and incentives within the same organizational structure and culture as its existing businesses.</p>\n<p id=\"6f22\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\">No wonder innovation at Acme had stalled!</p>\n<h2 id=\"ca7e\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\"><strong>The ambidextrous organization</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"1844\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">That companies should be simultaneously executing and innovating isn\u2019t a new insight.

So, while we did not lack the insight that execution and innovation need to be separate,\u00a0we did lack the processes, tools, culture, and organizational structures to implement it.</p>\n<p><span class=\"markup--quote markup--pullquote-quote is-other\">Corporate innovation initiatives have spent decades looking at other corporate structures as models for innovation, when in fact\u00a0<em class=\"markup--em markup--pullquote-em\">we should have been looking at startups for innovation models\u200a\u00a0</em>and adapting and adopting them for corporate use.</span></p>\n<p id=\"1100\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\">That\u2019s now changed.\u00a0The strategy and structure for 21st-century\u00a0corporate innovation will come from emulating the speed, urgency, agility,\u00a0and low-cost, rapid experimentation of startups.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4a0d\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\"><strong>What we now know about corporate innovation</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"8204\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">In the past few years, as the need for continuous innovation in companies has become critical,\u00a0<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://hbr.org/2013/05/why-the-lean-start-up-changes-everything/ar/1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">lean innovation methodologies</a>\u00a0(Lean LaunchPad/I-Corps) have also emerged. These methods allow rapid experimentation\u200a at startup speed\u200a, \u200awith the same rigor and discipline as traditional execution processes. Adopted by the National Science Foundation and some large companies, over 1,000 teams have used the process, and the resulting commercialization success speaks for itself.</p>\n<p>But running a Lean Startup inside an organization designed for execution is an exercise in futility.

The funding had come from 15 angel investors. Most of them were experienced founders and senior executives, like Ramakant Sharma (founder of Livspace) and Anurag Srivastava (co-founder of Jungle Ventures). Edureka founders Lovleen Bhatia and Kapil Tyagi, former Google India head Shailesh Rao, and Zipdial co-founder Amiya Pathak jumped in too, to name a few. Alex Chua, chief operating officer of Goldbell Group, invested US$75,000 in his personal capacity last year, and knew Pitstop well before Goldbell joined the latest round.</p>\n<p>Pitstop is a car maintenance and service provider, with a software-as-a-service product for garages and automobile workshops. It\u2019s currently operating across Bangalore, Delhi, and the National Capital Region (NCR) in India. The investors who have backed it are no fools. They are excited about the \u201cmulti-billion-dollar opportunity\u201d in building an auto after-sales service platform, says Sajid Fazalbhoy, principal at Blume Ventures.</p>\n<h2>The supply problem</h2>\n<p>Pitstop was founded by Mohan and Nirant Ramakuru, both mechanical engineers from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) \u2013 Kanpur, in August, 2015.</p>\n<p>The problem statement they began with is simple: car owners need regular servicing and repairs for their vehicles. There are <a href=\"http://www.knowindia.net/auto.html\" target=\"_blank\">around 28 million cars</a> running on Indian roads alone, so there could be no dearth of demand. But the crunch was in the supply side.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_282761\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/india-roads-traffic-jam-cars-in-india.jpg\" alt=\"india-roads-traffic-jam-cars-in-india\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\" class=\"size-full wp-image-282761\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">There are 28 million cars on Indian roads. Photo credit: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/lingaraj/2415084235/\" target=\"_blank\">Lingaraj GJ</a></p>\n</div>\n<p>Car owners rarely found garages that delivered reliable, convenient, and economical vehicle servicing. How do you know which roadside garage you could trust with your car \u2013 a prized possession for most car owners? Most car brands have their authorized service centers in the cities but they are expensive and often upsell repairs and spare parts to customers. \u201cThe authorized centers would charge you for their fancy infrastructure like a lounge to wait while your car is getting serviced \u2013 which isn\u2019t really an enjoyable thing to watch. What we are saying is you should not be paying for their sofas and tiles,\u201d says Mohan.</p>\n<p>Pitstop has tied up with around 90 garages in Bangalore and 50 in Delhi and surrounding areas. \u201cWe have deeply integrated with them. We provide these garages with three things: consistent business, which is their main need; technology and other tools to make sure that business is run efficiently; and spare parts, which are critical from a customer\u2019s point of view,\u201d Mohan says.</p>\n<p>The importance of spare parts should not be underestimated in markets like India rife with fake products.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how it works for a car owner when you book a service on Pitstop. A team will come to you, inspect your car, and give you a detailed quote for the service, including pictures and descriptions to explain why a particular repair is needed. General servicing, brake overhaul, wiper replacement, and such regular wear-and-tear issues can be done at your doorstep itself. You pay Pitstop for the service.</p>\n<p>Pitstop is going after customers with cars in running condition which have minor issues or need periodic maintenance. Higher level repair work like engine overhaul will require a trip to the garage.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have measured the time each servicing trip takes \u2013 around 90 minutes. At authorized servicing centers, it would take around eight hours,\u201d Mohan says.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>See: <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/y-combinator-backed-servx\">Y Combinator-backed startup takes a shot at dominating car repairs in India</a></strong></p>\n<p>There are a lot of startups competing in this space already, many with deep pockets \u2013 for example, <a href=\"https://bumper.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Bumper</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cartisan.in/\" target=\"_blank\">Cartisan</a>, <a href=\"http://www.getcarxpert.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Getcarexpert</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.carworkz.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Carworkz by Mahindra</a>. Another younger rival is <a href=\"http://servx.in/\" target=\"_blank\">ServX</a>, which claimed to have helped close to 90,000 users get their cars repaired \u2013 over 150,000 repairs \u2013 last year. ServX was in the Winter 2017 batch of Y Combinator.</p>\n<p>There are several others as well, Mohan agrees. \u201cSome are doing well. Some of them are shutting down,\u201d he says, without specifying who. \u201cWe believe that the problem is in the garages. So instead of providing services like pick-and-drop, we focus on the supply side. For our customers, we are the garage. That is our differentiator,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have been at it for almost two years now.\u201d</p>\n<h2>The first wash-out</h2>\n<p>Initially, Pitstop started as an aggregator app for car washing services but shut that down after three months.</p>\n<p>\u201cI call myself a serial failure because I have been trying out startup ideas for the last 10 years or so,\u201d Mohan jokes.</p>\n<p>Two years ago, he was scouting for opportunities in the conversational commerce space when he noticed how groceries, pharmacies, and spare parts shops were doing brisk business. He gravitated towards auto repairs partly because of his training as a mechanical engineer and also because he found that the industry hasn\u2019t really changed for decades.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe scouted the market for six months. We pivoted the idea thrice. Almost shut down twice,\u201d he recalls. The initial car wash app got the Pitstop team to interact closely with customers. \u201cTheir voice was unanimous, that we do something about the car services and repairs market because it was broken.\u201d</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>See: <a href=\"%E2%80%9Chttps://www.techinasia.com/mistakes-funded-rivals-taught-spinny-to-pivot%22\">Mistakes of its well-funded rivals taught this startup to pivot and steal a march</a></strong></p>\n<p>The space was so unorganized that most garages function haphazardly, he found. \u201cGarages charge based on your appearance. If you are dressed nicely, they will bill you 2,000 rupees (US$30). If you are dressed shabbily, they will charge you a quarter of it. And most local garages shut down after three or four years as they do not get consistent business through the week. Weekends tend to be crowded but the rest of the week they hardly see any customers.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mohan shut down the car wash app for two months before restarting with the fresh insights. \u201cIt was a space crying for a painkiller. Then we started experiments with authorized dealerships.\u201d Pitstop evolved into its current shape from there.</p>\n<h2>The B2B pivot</h2>\n<p>The US$1 million funding comes after one and a half years at it.</p>\n<p>Along the way, Pitstop embarked on a business-to-business mode for servicing as well, catering to companies running fleets of cars. \u201cWe have already built a complete tech stack which would help these companies get visibility on service and repair of their cars. Earlier, they used to maintain a paper trail for every car. We have automated all that,\u201d Mohan says, without naming the fleets Pitstop is working with. \u201cAlmost 35 percent of what we do is B2B now.\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s where the investment from the Goldbell group becomes more interesting. Goldbell group is one of the largest automotive companies in Southeast Asia. It owns leasing companies, car rental companies, and fleets of industrial vehicles. \u201cThey were excited about the prospects of technology being used for fleet management, customer convenience, customer transparency, and so on,\u201d Mohan says.</p>\n<p>The use of analytics with IoT (internet of things) would create new opportunities for preventive maintenance and higher efficiency going forward.</p>\n<p>Pitstop\u2019s software will go live in Singapore in a month\u2019s time, and later in Vietnam and other countries in the region, he says. Goldbell has been helping Pitstop with that.</p>\n<p>The startup is holding back on an aggressive expansion in Southeast Asia currently but expects to go full-fledged after a year, during which they plan to offer car servicing in other Indian cities such as Hyderabad, Chennai, Mumbai, and Pune.</p>", "spider_name": "techinasia", "id": "techinasia_431676", "has_funding_news": 0.2875104546546936}

This is a multi-sided business model. Some of the successful examples of this model include Facebook, Uber, eBay, and Airbnb.</p>\n<p>Building a multi-sided platform for a startup is difficult because a new platform can\u2019t initially attract both buyers and sellers. If there are fewer sellers, buyers will leave, and if there are fewer buyers, sellers won\u2019t sign on.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a list of ways to overcome that chicken-and-egg problem and successfully develop a multi-sided platform.</p>\n<h2>1. Start small</h2>\n<p>By starting small, you can gradually attract users on both sides of the platform. You can focus on a single city, area, or customer segment and prove the model to both buyers and sellers. Once that happens, you can build both sides together. Uber, for example, started its operations with only one city (San Francisco), and once it was met with success there, it expanded its operations.</p>\n<h3><strong>Technique</strong></h3>\n<p>To successfully start small, select a niche that has less competition and a huge audience. Initially, don\u2019t hire a big team and try to do most\u00a0things on your own. This will help you keep tabs on costs. Don\u2019t invest much in the infrastructure and build a website that has a simple UI.</p>\n<p>At this stage, hiring the first employee is a crucial decision, as they fully embody what leaders want to see in their team. Airbnb founder and CEO Brian Chesky took a great deal of time in hiring his company\u2019s first employee. He spent five months reviewing thousands of resumes and conducting hundreds of interviews before making the offer to the first engineer.</p>\n<h2>2. Start with a linear business model and then scale</h2>\n<p>According to this strategy, you can start with a linear business model, act as a supplier, and develop a user base. After you\u2019ve created a user base, you can attract sellers to join your marketplace.</p>\n<p>Zomato, for example, was just a simple information portal on restaurants. It later started offering services like online ordering and table bookings once it succeeded in building a large user base.</p>\n<p>Amazon initially also started with fulfilling all the customer orders on its own. Once the company grew, it opened up the Amazon marketplace platform.</p>\n<h3>Technique</h3>\n<p>If you want to start a linear business model, you need to offer something unique to your audience first. It\u2019s important that you satisfy your customers in these three aspects: quality, quantity, and speed. These can help you gain loyal customers and build the supply side.</p>\n<p>One such example is Fiverr, which started with an entirely new concept: allowing users to buy and sell tasks at US$5. Their business idea was featured on\u00a0<a href=\"https://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2010/03/16/what-will-people-do-for-5-fiverr-lets-you-find-out/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a>\u00a0and Yahoo, which helped the platform gain a lot of attention.</p>\n<h2>3. Make users attract other users</h2>\n<p>Marketplace owners can make users attract one or more set of other users and demonstrate the potential benefits of participating in the platform. These initial users then set\u00a0up a positive feedback loop that leads to continuing growth.</p>\n<p>The best example of this is <em>Huffington Post</em>, which hired writers initially to create high-quality blog posts for the site to attract readers. This made readers contribute blog posts of their own, which led to a wider network of content creators and even more users.</p>\n<h3>Technique</h3>\n<p>The best way to use this strategy is to come up with a referral program. Dropbox, for example, came up with a referral program in which both the referrer and the referred got certain benefits if they took action. The program led to an increase in Dropbox signups by <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/248867\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">60 percent</a>!</p>\n<p>You can even use social media platforms to attract audiences to blog posts, videos, and photos, leading to more discussions and a bigger community.</p>\n<h2>4. Adopt a marquee strategy</h2>\n<p>Giving incentives to attract high-value users, i.e. those whose participation will add value to your platform, may also work. This is often called a single- or double-sided marquee strategy.</p>\n<p>In 2009, the Swiss Postal Service, for example, offered iPads to rural households to convince them to use their new digital messaging delivery platform. Similarly, when Uber launched in Seattle, it offered subsidies for drivers even when they didn\u2019t have customers.</p>\n<h3>Technique</h3>\n<p>To apply a marquee strategy, you must first identify high-value users. Do you have insufficient sellers? Do your sellers need more buyers? Then, identify what possible incentives you can offer them. You can initially offer free services to a few influencers in the targeted niche. If any of them like your service, they may join and recommend you, which can help you attract a user base.</p>\n<p>Before you launch, you could also set up a pre-launch funnel to persuade users to join your marketplace. Create an informative sales page and offer them freebies or additional discounts.</p>\n<h2>5. Target users who can fill both sides</h2>\n<p>The goal of this strategy is to find a user group which can be both a buyer and a seller. Through this strategy, you won\u2019t need to worry about attracting two separate user groups.</p>\n<p>Etsy, an online handmade goods platform, for example, brought on users who not only bought handmade goods but also sold them. So, the company decided to focus on these types of users before it expanded to other markets.</p>\n<h3>Technique</h3>\n<p>To implement this strategy, you can provide interdependent services and expand horizontally to get sellers who can act as buyers as well. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re starting a marketplace that has service providers offering web development services. These service providers might even need design services, making them act as a buyer as well.</p>\n<h2>6. Enter with significant pre-investment</h2>\n<p>By making a significant upfront investment, you can assure your sellers that it\u2019s safe for them to join your marketplace and that you\u2019re committed to growing your platform.</p>\n<p>This strategy works for development platforms, where developers incur significant upfront costs to join the marketplace and high switching costs if they have to leave. For example, when Microsoft launched Xbox, it had a US$500 million marketing budget. This helped attract new developers and publishers to the platform, making them feel secure in developing games for the Xbox.</p>\n<h3>Technique</h3>\n<p>If your idea is promising, get seed funding. Approach your friends, family, and even angel investors and ask for financial support. You can even opt for business incubators, which can support you in business planning, mentoring, raising seed funding, etc.</p>\n<p>Another option is to get crowdfunding, where you can pick a platform to raise funding on <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Kickstarter</a> or <a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Indiegogo</a>.</p>\n<h2>7. Leverage another platform</h2>\n<p>To get enough users on board, you can leverage another platform. Airbnb is the best example to explain this strategy.</p>\n<p>As Craigslist was the market leader in the short-term apartment rental space, <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/airbnb-harvested-craigslist-to-grow-its-listings-says-competitor-2011-5\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Airbnb created a system</a> in which users could post to Craigslist and their site at the same time. Since the listing was visible on Craigslist also, Airbnb could leverage its millions of users, creating inbound links for users and Airbnb as a platform too. This helped them increase their user base substantially.</p>\n<h3>Technique</h3>\n<p>To implement this strategy, you can check if any other leading online platform with a pre-existing network is providing APIs or a database of customers. For example, Uber piggybacked on Google\u2019s credibility by integrating its ride request services with Google Maps API. Through this, it aimed to reach existing Google Maps users and eliminate the need to convince users of its credibility.</p>\n<h2>8. Focus on the transaction</h2>\n<p>You can make the transaction the focus of your product. This means identifying and then reducing the friction for the first transaction on both sides.</p>\n<p>Groupon, for example, initially hosted one transaction per day for consumers, offering them an incentive to spread the word about the platform. It also allowed sellers to back out if there weren\u2019t a minimum number of buyers.</p>\n<h3>Technique</h3>\n<p>To identify and limit the friction for first transactions, you can ask questions like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How many clicks are needed to initiate a sale?</li>\n<li>Are there any compulsory waiting periods? If yes, how can you cut this down?</li>\n<li>Are you getting all the information required for sales easily?</li>\n<li>What aspect is getting the focus?</li>\n<li>Is the sales funnel properly designed?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can track these by using the heatmap features provided by some of the leading web analytics tools like <a href=\"https://www.crazyegg.com/visual-website-analytics\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Crazy Egg</a> or <a href=\"https://www.hotjar.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Hotjar</a> to understand your customers\u2019 behavior and get an idea of what they are looking for.</p>\n<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>\n<p>The above approaches will allow you to overcome the chicken-and-egg problem, attract first users, and easily adopt a multi-sided business model for your startup.</p>\n<p>Building a multi-sided business model is undeniably more difficult than a direct one. While multi-sided businesses have their challenges, they also offer more opportunities for monetization and distinctive ways to pivot. Many of the great business giants of the modern era, like Amazon, Microsoft, Uber, etc., have grown strong by leveraging the benefits of the multi-sided business model and making it work to their advantage!</p>", "spider_name": "techinasia", "id": "techinasia_429719", "has_funding_news": 0.463972806930542}

Participating in desired ICOs and trading tokens on exchanges can also be tedious and difficult.</p>\n<p>These are the problems Matthew Dibb and his team aim to solve through <a href=\"https://astronaut.capital\" target=\"_blank\">Astronaut Capital</a>, a service that allows retail and institutional investors to participate in the growth of a variety of cryptocoins through a single token \u2013 the \u201cAstro\u201d token. That way, instead of investing in and conducting due diligence on each ICO separately, investors put their money in Astronaut, a kind of crypto-mutual fund.</p>\n<p>Astronaut itself is currently holding an ICO. Its goal is to raise US$22 million, which it will use to invest in other ICOs. Whoever buys its token indirectly participates in these other ICOs and earns through:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Quarterly ether income distributions, which grow as Astronaut cashes in on gains from the assets under its management</li>\n<li>Capital gains from trading the Astro token, whose value is aligned with the value of the fund</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What will determine the success of its investment strategy is its wholly-owned cryptocurrency research arm in Singapore, <a href=\"https://picoloresearch.com\" target=\"_blank\">Picolo Research</a>.</p>\n<h2>Independent assessment</h2>\n<p>Picolo is a free service that assesses how risky an ICO is. For example, it gives a token sale five stars with a \u201cbuy\u201d tag if it\u2019s \u201ca high conviction buying opportunity,\u201d or two stars with a \u201crisky\u201d tag if it comes with a big risk of losing capital. Sometimes, they tag it outright as a \u201cscam\u201d that should be avoided at all costs. The tags and ratings are accompanied by commentaries detailing why the ICOs were rated as such and their strengths and weaknesses.</p>\n<p>It has been operating for some time before the team stumbled upon the idea of an ICO investment fund.</p>\n<p>Picolo, now with more than 10,000 subscribers, started out as a passion project. Last year, Dibb and some partners were trading cryptocurrencies for clients, some of whom asked for institutional-grade reports on ICOs to guide them on the best bets.</p>\n<p>Coming from an investment background, he said they were used to that kind of work. Dibb is the director of Wise-owl, a research company for microcap stocks in Australia. These microcaps \u2013 with market valuations below US$10 million \u2013 are generally in their early stages and built on a concept you can barely verify due to scarce information in the marketplace. So making the transition to ICOs, which are very similar, was easy.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe really enjoyed doing those ICO reports and we said this is something that the public market will probably want,\u201d said Dibb. \u201cWe felt there was a need.\u201d</p>\n<p>With a couple of sample reports, Dibb and his partners launched a contact form on Product Hunt and Beta List, and 6,000 people signed up in a week.</p>\n<p>Industry stakeholders we spoke with recognized the need for assessment tools in the rapidly growing ICO market.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey will definitely play a big role,\u201d said Julian Hosp, co-founder and president of TenX, which closed one of the largest ICOs when it <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/tenx-crosscoin-ico\">raised US$80 million</a> in a matter of minutes back in June.</p>\n<p>\u201cBut that\u2019s only if their research is done independently and in the users\u2019 best interest,\u201d he noted.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is quite a difficult task and a few platforms are trying to achieve it. The challenge will be bridging the gap between independence and financing, and whoever manages that in a profitable yet still unprejudiced way will win,\u201d Hosp added.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_424737\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-424737\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/14498871_l.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2508\" height=\"1672\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: <a href=\"https://www.123rf.com/profile_cooldesign\" target=\"_blank\">cooldesign / 123RF</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Takashi Sano, venture partner at Global Brain, a Japanese VC firm investing in blockchain startups, echoed the same view. \u201cHaving more information in this market is needed and third-party opinion has value.\u201d</p>\n<p>There are plenty of sites that provide ICO assessment, but many of them are paid by the ICOs themselves to produce the reports.</p>\n<p>Dibb claimed he\u2019s been financing Picolo out of his own pocket. \u201cThe purpose is to be able to put out transparent, totally independent market research.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have not taken any money or remuneration from companies to do our research and write our reports,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>Picolo\u2019s analysts are also not allowed to participate in ICOs on a personal capacity to avoid conflict of interest. \u201cThis is part of our \u2018Chinese walls\u2019 as they are called in investment banking.\u201d</p>\n<h2>Determining factors</h2>\n<p>Most companies launching ICOs are in their idea and pre-revenue stage. It\u2019s nearly impossible to know which ones will survive, let alone actually take off. The recent phenomenon has also given rise to \u201c<a href=\"http://fortune.com/2017/08/29/sec-blockchain-ico-scam/\" target=\"_blank\">pump-and-dump</a>\u201d schemes and blatant ripoffs where companies take money but fail to build the promised product.</p>\n<p>So how does Picolo analyze risk? Again, an approach akin to covering the microcap sector, it bases its research off several fundamental and technical factors, such as the structure of the token, anticipated capital to be raised, and management and team track record \u2013 their professional background and businesses they\u2019ve built or exited \u2013 just to cite a few.</p>\n<p>Dibb recalled the time they put out <a href=\"https://picoloresearch.com/upload/attachment/42092.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">a report about a US-based startup called Paragon</a>, which aimed to bring transparency and standardize supply in the marijuana industry. \u201cTheir CEO was an ex-beauty queen and model who hadn\u2019t really started a business. The company paid a whole bunch of high-profile rappers, hip-hop artists to promote it. What we did was look at the team \u2013 they\u2019re raising millions worth of ether, are they going to be able to execute?\u201d</p>\n<p>They also watch out for ICOs without a maximum cap on the amount of funding they want to raise. \u201cWhen we see an ICO and instead of just raising their target of US$10 million \u2013 they raise an extra US$50 million \u2013 we ask \u2018what are they going to do with it and why do they need it?\u2019 That has happened so many times,\u201d he explained.</p>\n<p>Astronaut has also been able to identify successful token crowdsales, such as 0x Project (ZRX), which it tagged with a <a href=\"https://picoloresearch.com/22/0x-project-zrx\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cbuy\u201d</a> at roughly $0.05. The ICO token hit as high as $0.34 and is now trading at $0.22.</p>\n<p>Dibb\u2019s team \u2013 the investment committee \u2013 consists of five people who come from a mixture of technical development, analysis, corporate finance, as well as private equity (PE) backgrounds. \u201cInvestment committees also exist in PE firms, family offices, etc, so we\u2019ve sort of replicated exactly what that is and how successful that is,\u201d he said.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_431273\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-431273 size-full\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/matthew-dibb-founder-astronaut.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"950\" height=\"768\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Matthew Dibb. Photo credit: Astronaut.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Zooming in on security</h2>\n<p>Probably the hardest thing about the ICO market is its susceptibility to phishing scams and hacking, Dibb stated. Phishing attacks, which have <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/225-million-lost-as-cryptocurrency-investors-get-hooked-by-phishing-scams\" target=\"_blank\">stolen a combined US$225 million this year</a>, fool investors by redirecting them to a mirrored social media or web page that replicates the official ICO. The tricked investors would then hand over their payment credentials.</p>\n<p>\u201cTo be honest, most of the time the issue is a lack of security on the ICO\u2019s part \u2013 they should\u2019ve known better.\u201d</p>\n<p>Security is also something that Picolo looks at, he said. The team examines ICOs\u2019 know-your-customer process to ensure \u201cyou\u2019re not letting somebody through the door who can potentially take advantage of everybody else.\u201d They also ring up a lot of the management teams to ask them about the level of encryption they have on their websites. \u201cWe ask who they\u2019re using when they collect ethereum or what sort of wallet they have \u2013 if it\u2019s a simple wallet or a multi-signature wallet.\u201d</p>\n<h2>A way to monetize</h2>\n<p>Dibb admitted having no monetization plan upon setting up Picolo, although a few months in, his team looked at charging a yearly premium subscription for the assessment reports.</p>\n<p>They had a lightbulb moment after conducting a survey among subscribers to gauge their level of participation in ICOs and the issues they normally face. \u201cWhat we found is that they love the research they are getting, but they hated having to apply for the ICO, having to collect the tokens and move it to the exchange and manage it. That whole process could be fragmented and difficult to understand particularly for people who are not tech-savvy,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>The concept of Astronaut was born. The majority or 92 percent of the funds Astronaut will raise from its ongoing token sale will be invested in ICOs and the rest will be spent for operational costs. The fund aims to secure ICO investments that provide returns of five times and more.</p>\n<p>Asked about the risk of investing in Astronaut itself, Dibb admitted that like other ICOs, there\u2019s a risk. Astronaut is susceptible to market ups and downs. The difference with other ICOs is that instead of creating a product where it could burn all of investors\u2019 money, Astronaut is already set up and working, he explained. \u201cWe do not have the risk of running out of money or not bringing a product to market.\u201d</p>\n<p>Upon the close of the token sale, Picolo will exclusively service Astronaut and its token holders.</p>\n<p>Dibb said they will still release some reports to the public albeit a bit delayed.</p>\n<p>For transparency\u2019s sake, he said Picolo will also disclose any exposure Astronaut may have in token sales in their reports.</p>\n<p>As many ICO research groups are paid and conflicted, Dibb said there\u2019s only a few he considers competitors and one of them is US-based Smith and Crown. He wishes for there to be more. \u201cWe want more competition [\u2026] It\u2019s the only way this huge market is going to have longevity. We can\u2019t do it ourselves.\u201d</p>\n<h2>Filtering out dumb money</h2>\n<p>With more people jumping on the ICO bandwagon \u2013 even <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/19/jamie-foxx-ico-investors-worried.html\" target=\"_blank\">celebrities have begun endorsing it</a> \u2013 plus the fact that it\u2019s largely unregulated, there are concerns that it\u2019s turned into a bubble waiting to burst.</p>\n<p>Dibb, however, believes that\u2019s not the case. There\u2019s a very big difference between the dotcom bubble in the late 90s and today\u2019s ICOs and that is the quality of investors going into ICOs, he stated. \u201cMost of the people going into these are quite knowledgeable \u2013 a lot of them are programmers and developers. I wouldn\u2019t say that a lot of dumb money has come. It\u2019s actually kind of hard to invest in ICOs if you look at the mechanics.\u201d</p>\n<p>Astronaut aims to close its token sale by October 25 and list on a few cryptocurrency exchanges beginning November.</p>", "spider_name": "techinasia", "id": "techinasia_431287", "has_funding_news": 0.4873485565185547}

Hashimoto said the funding would be used to grow the company\u2019s presence in Europe and North America, including the establishment of an office in Amsterdam.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe have successfully raised funds \u2013 not on a grand scale like a lot of companies do \u2013 but it\u2019s big news for us because we haven\u2019t raised funds externally until now,\u201d he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Nulab was founded way back in 2004, Hashimoto said that he wasn\u2019t sure if it is correct to think of his company as being a startup. Nevertheless, it has experienced the rapid growth characteristic of early-stage businesses, with a 140 percent boost in year-on-year sales over the past 12 months. \u201cSo maybe we are a startup after all!\u201d he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">We would go to VCs and they would say Nulab maybe doesn\u2019t need money.</blockquote></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nulab\u2019s age makes today\u2019s announcement of its first-ever fundraising round all the more remarkable. Hashimoto said that the company decided now was the right time to seek its first external investment, as it is aiming to significantly expand its presence outside of Japan.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The company\u2019s impressive growth was sometimes a hindrance as Hashimoto and his team set about pitching to investors. \u201cWe would go to VCs and they would say Nulab maybe doesn\u2019t need money,\u201d he said. But he explained that Nulab\u2019s ambition to take the next steps and expand beyond Japan would require funding. \u201cIf you are thinking of being global company, you need to create one team internationally. But tax laws, employment regulations, and so on, make that very difficult.\u201d </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He could hire several people in Japan for the cost of hiring one person in the US, he said. \u201cCosts are very different from country to country, so you need a lot of money if you are going to expand globally. Also, if you are going to create one global team, you need to bring in good management to make that work.\u201d</span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_431086\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-431086\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/TIA-TYO-2017-0928-2-PM2-PM1114-0941-_wm.jpg\" alt=\"Nulab founder and CEO Masanori Hashimoto\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nulab founder and CEO Masanori Hashimoto speaks at Tech in Asia Tokyo 2017.

JP Morgan Securities was the sole book-running manager for the offering, with Bear Stearns &amp; Co. as the lead manager.</p>\n<p>We had barely learned how to run a public company to a quarterly rhythm when we felt the early tremors of the credit crisis. In an ironic twist, Bear Stearns was the first to fall and was forced to eventually merge with JP Morgan in a stock swap that valued it at a fraction of what it was valued just two days before the merger.</p>\n<p>Events unfolded faster than we could imagine. The Virtusa stock, like the rest of the markets around the globe, went into a free fall, and employee stock options were soon under water. Clients began cutting\u2014some even canceled\u2014discretionary spends and revenue projections went for a toss.</p>\n<h2>Before the crisis</h2>\n<p>Virtusa took great pride in being able to partner with the CIOs of client organizations in shaping and executing their IT strategy. This called for some nontrivial IT and business consulting capabilities. However, most of these consultants were located in the US and Europe while our delivery teams were largely based out of Asia.</p>\n<p>To strengthen the quality of our engagement with these consulting teams, we decided to hire a rockstar HR head for America and Europe. After a long search, we found Chris Carter, the perfect candidate, and brought him on board toward the end of 2006.</p>\n<p>Carter was an unusually clear thinker and deeply passionate about nurturing talent. The consultants loved him. In a very short span of time, he was able to up the game and create the kind of clarity and positive energy never seen before. His understanding of the interplay between business needs and talent strategies was amazing. I admired and liked Carter deeply. Whenever I visited Boston, I would stop by his place, and he did the same when he visited India.</p>\n<p>During one of my visits to Boston just before the financial crisis, we talked about interesting travel destinations. Ladakh,\u00a0a region at the northern tip of India, was on top of the list for Helen, Carter\u2019s wife. When I told her that summer would be a great time to visit, she made a remark that later proved to be prophetic: \u201cIf you don\u2019t fire Chris, we will make this trip next summer.\u201d I just laughed away the comment.</p>\n<p>Several years later, Carter told me that they still remember this exchange clearly, and it comes up when they reflect on this time in their lives.</p>\n<h2><b>The financial crisis changed everything\u00a0</b></h2>\n<p>In the weeks following the collapse of Bear Stearns, analysts were all forecasting a long global winter, and we saw a loss in revenue faster than we had feared.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">I knew we\u2019d have a lot of difficult questions to answer on this, but tough calls needed to be made for the interest of the company.</blockquote>\n<p>After some serious deliberation, we figured that the only way to calm our investors was to make some hard calls on costs. So, we identified costs to be pruned and people to fire. Carter\u2019s name was on the list, along with several others. I knew we\u2019d have a lot of difficult questions to answer on this, but tough calls needed to be made for the interest of the company.</p>\n<p>We worked out a separation package beyond what was in the contract. Carter accepted this decision with dignity and poise\u00a0and gracefully agreed to communicate this and the firing of one of his team members to his team. In this latter conversation, he couldn\u2019t completely mask what he truly felt about this decision and said, \u201cThe company is now no longer keen on a gold standard.\u201d</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, our general counsel was in the adjacent room and he strongly recommended that we declare the package we had worked out for Carter void and instead stay with the separation terms laid out in the contract. I had to tell him that his view was legalistic and myopic\u00a0and that under these circumstances, Carter\u2019s comment was better overlooked and forgiven.</p>\n<p>After we\u2019d finished the headcount cuts, we had a town hall meeting in our Boston office. Obviously, everyone was disappointed, though not many questioned the decision.</p>\n<p>Most official communications on such occasions are a bit of a sham. But I still haven\u2019t figured out if there\u2019s a better way to do this. The good thing is that regardless of what the official line is, people always know the truth. That has been my consolation whenever I\u2019ve had to communicate something that was unclear or obfuscated.</p>\n<h2><b>Lessons I learned</b></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>It\u2019s not easy to make tough calls, especially when it\u2019s unfair to the person involved. However, in the larger interest of the company and on some rare occasions, these calls need to be made.</li>\n<li>My eight-year-old daughter was inconsolable for a very long time when she knew about the whole situation. Don\u2019t talk about these things in front of children who will never get the ways of corporate life.</li>\n<li>Expect the person you\u2019re firing to vent and say negative things. Be very indulgent. Don\u2019t take a legalistic or hard position. At the same time, don\u2019t make statements that distance you from the decision like, \u201cI really don\u2019t support this decision, but it\u2019s a call the organization has made and I\u2019m just implementing it.\u201d Take ownership for the decision because you are the organization.</li>\n<li>Offer to help and be genuine.</li>\n<li>Never ask a terminated employee to be the communicator (certainly not the sole communicator) of their termination to their direct reports. It puts them in the very difficult position of explaining and defending their own termination when the direct report inevitably asks why. The business leaders who made the decision need to be the primary communicators of the decision (with help from the impacted individual if possible).</li>\n<li>Don\u2019t cut off your relationship with the employee, but don\u2019t be intrusive in trying to preserve it. Allow things to settle down and work slowly at restoring the relationship.</li>\n<li>On occasions like these and several others involving M&amp;As, messages need to be crafted carefully. But in spite of your best efforts, they will be a little opaque. Don\u2019t fret too much. People know the truth regardless of what you say.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To this day, Carter and I continue to be the best of friends! Our mutual respect and fondness\u00a0haven\u2019t diminished one bit.</p>\n<p><em>This article was first published on the author\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/firing-someone-you-deeply-admire-like-hari-t-n/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">LinkedIn page</a>.</em></p>", "spider_name": "techinasia", "id": "techinasia_430981", "has_funding_news": 0.6696506142616272}

The session featured representatives from Globis Capital, YJ Capital, 500 Startups, and Rakuten.</p>\n<p>Part of what\u2019s driving this upward trend is technological advancements that have led to breakthroughs like the internet of things, blockchain tech, and artificial intelligence, according to Globis Capital partner and chief strategy officer Shinichi Takamiya. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the kind of change we used to see in the 90s,\u201d he said.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">You need a certain kind of grit if you are to establish a long-term business.</blockquote>\n<p>500 Startups Japan partner James Riney added that more old-school industries in Japan like insurance and law are being transformed by technology. \u201cThere are many industries where tech hasn\u2019t had much reach yet,\u201d he said, highlighting the opportunity that\u2019s there for Japanese entrepreneurs.</p>\n<p>Healthcare, homecare, architecture, and real estate are some other examples of existing markets in Japan that are ripe for improvement through technology, added Hogil Doh, investment manager for Rakuten.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s becoming a tipping point \u2013 these social problems are singular in Japan and we\u2019re experiencing everything ahead of other countries,\u201d he said.

According to Tokyo-based firm Japan Venture Research (via <em><a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Trends/Japan-s-startup-funds-hit-post-crisis-high-in-2016\" target=\"_blank\">Nikkei</a></em>), that value hasn\u2019t reached these heights since 2008.</p>\n<p>The focus on traditional industries combined with the market\u2019s coming-of-age has the added benefit of potentially attracting more mature entrepreneurs \u2013 people who have been part of those industries and know their needs and problems well, Takamiya said.</p>\n<p>\u201cLegacy industries present new chances for seasoned entrepreneurs, business owners, and startups,\u201d he explained. \u201cHaving achieved some scale in the market, you need a certain kind of grit if you are to establish a long-term business.\u201d</p>\n<h2>Hone your craft</h2>\n<p>The investors agreed that VC firms in Japan are still not as highly specialized as their US counterparts.</p>\n<p>\u201cUS VCs are very vocal in the areas they are interested in,\u201d said Shinichiro Hori, CEO of YJ Capital. In Japan, on the other hand, VC fields of specialization aren\u2019t as clear. \u201cIt takes three to five years to build specialization in a particular area,\u201d Hori added.</p>\n<p>Riney attributed this to the relatively smaller need for Japanese VCs to stand out from the crowd. \u201cJapan is still very small, and the need for differentiation is not as important as it is in the US,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause the VC industry in Japan is small and not so well established, we\u2019re kind of running our firms as entrepreneurs ourselves,\u201d Takamiya added.</p>\n<p>Much like other developed economies that aren\u2019t Silicon Valley, Japan is also feeling the talent crunch, the investors said. In particular, the country seems to lack resources for investors and entrepreneurs to track down and recruit promising individuals, both local and foreign.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_430879\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/tia-tokyo-2017-japan-vc-panel-02.jpg\" alt=\"Japanese VC panel at Tech in Asia Tokyo 2017\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" class=\"size-full wp-image-430879\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Rakuten investment manager Hogil Doh (L) and YJ Capital CEO Shinichiro Hori.

Even so, bitcoin and its contemporaries are bogged down by one major issue: their value is still mostly speculative. Despite people making inroads to turn cryptocurrencies into a mainstream financial tool, their valuations are still driven largely by investor sentiment and major news events.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>See also:\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/talk/state-blockchain-climbs-chinese-resistance\" rel=\"nofollow\">State of the blockchain: Bitcoin climbs on despite Chinese resistance</a></strong></p>\n<p>Until now, there hasn\u2019t been a real solution to this volatility conundrum. While bitcoin and the blockchain that supports it could be a potentially game-changing technology, institutional investors will remain wary until it can prove its real value. However, a new company is banking on being able to change that with a simple fix: tying their new cryptocurrency to the value of gold.</p>\n<p>Gold has always been one of the safest investments in times of doubt. Although the metal doesn\u2019t appreciate like equities or even money in a savings account, it retains value exceptionally well. Even after the dollar was unpegged from gold, the precious metal remains a favorite of risk-averse investors, thanks to its low volatility.</p>\n<p>Now, a new platform,\u00a0<a href=\"https://goldmint.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">GoldMint</a>, is looking to merge the excitement for cryptocurrencies with the reliability of gold.</p>\n<h2><strong>The rise of asset-backed coins<br></strong></h2>\n<p>Instead of deriving value from speculation and sentiment, GoldMint is creating\u00a0a <a href=\"https://www.cryptoninjas.net/2017/08/10/goldmint-project-launches-to-provide-gold-ownership-for-cryptocurrency-investors/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">stable and transparent way</a> to price their coins. The company is pegging the value of their tokens called GOLD to the precious metal itself. To do so, they have created a logistics system that lets customers trade in their precious metal, which is objectively valued, and receive an equivalent amount of GOLD in return. This sets it apart from other cryptocurrencies and means that its underlying architecture must be different.</p>\n<p>GoldMint, which is\u00a0currently running its ICO, is using the blockchain technology Graphene. It is necessary to employ a unique blockchain for this project because the basic concept of using a physical asset is entirely foreign to bitcoin. While bitcoin\u2019s chain requires users to show their proof-of-work to profitably participate (this is called mining), gold cannot be created with spare processor power. The Graphene blockchain allows miners to run the network and receive commission from users who transact in GOLD in the form of a different administrative token called MNT.</p>\n<p>The use of the Graphene blockchain architecture also gives GOLD security advantages. Because it is open source, the company can implement a series of tools and enhance security. Moreover, it is a proven ecosystem, as several other financial systems use its underlying infrastructure.</p>\n<h2><strong>How gold is turned into GOLD<br></strong></h2>\n<p>GoldMint has found a surprisingly simple solution to turn customers\u2019 physical gold into digital tokens\u2014<a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/tech/gold-and-blockchain-unlikely-power-couple/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Custody Bot</a>.\u00a0The hardware is a secure storage system that has a built-in spectrometer. When people put their physical gold into the bot, it will automatically weigh and grade the metal and transmit the value to GoldMint\u2019s systems. Users will then receive their equivalent value in GOLD tokens. The value is derived from the LBMA (London Bullion Market Association) fixed price.</p>\n<p>The best part of this system is that the Custody Bot itself can be widely available, as it is essentially a secure vending machine. Customers can find any location that hosts a bot and walk away with GOLD instantly, instead of having to wait days for transactions to complete. They can then use the proceeds from their ring, for instance, to purchase other things.</p>\n<p>As of now, the company is aiming to target <a href=\"http://www.prunderground.com/goldmint-vending-machine-turns-gold-into-cryptocurrency/00101495/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">access to 1 percent of the world\u2019s gold circulation</a>\u00a0by installing it in pawnshops around the world. The eventual goal is to offer this service in more locations such as shopping centers.</p>\n<p>Once in their digital wallet, token holders can use them to pay for any service that accepts the cryptocurrency. The company is already offering an API to companies and merchants to expand the network\u2019s range.</p>\n<h2><strong>Revolutionizing the gold market<br></strong></h2>\n<p>Greater blockchain adoption within precious metal activities means that GoldMint is <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-16/new-currency-sparks-race-to-remake-one-of-world-s-oldest-markets\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">not without competition</a>. Firms vie to increase transparency and improve price discovery in a market that regularly experiences approximately US$27 billion in daily turnover. GoldMint will face challenges from companies like\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.royalmint.com/bullion\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Royal Mint Gold</a> and <a href=\"http://www.tradewindmarkets.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">TradeWind</a>, which are working to lower the costs of trading and storage for gold-backed crypto-assets.</p>\n<p>Royal Mint Gold is issuing RMGs which represent direct ownership of one gram of fine gold. Apart from being stored at Royal Mint\u2019s vaults, investors gain access to good delivery bars under LBMA\u2019s standards.\u00a0Meanwhile, TradeWind\u2019s model is a blockchain-based system that connects buyers and sellers of gold already held in LBMA-certified vaults by using a distributed ledger.</p>\n<h2><strong>Can GOLD work in the crypto-market?<br></strong></h2>\n<p>It may seem like GoldMint is offering simply another altcoin, but GOLD seems to be striking its own path. According to the company, it is looking to decentralize gold trading and give owners more power to turn their non-appreciating and hard-to-use gold into a liquid digital currency.</p>\n<p>More importantly, however, by pegging GOLD\u2019s value to a real asset, the company can potentially get around cryptocurrency\u2019s biggest issue\u2014volatility and speculation. <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoin-losses-worsen-as-chinese-exchange-closes-1505404288\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">In recent weeks</a> alone, bitcoin has lost and gained thousands of dollars in single days as the result of news events. Creating a cryptocurrency that can not only survive such market shocks but also retain its value over the long term could lead to a much wider acceptance of cryptocurrencies.</p>", "spider_name": "techinasia", "id": "techinasia_429895", "has_funding_news": 0.4841315746307373}

But things get\u00a0a bit messier when your business starts to have wider operations, as you\u2019ll need to make correct strategic financial decisions.</p>\n<p>Your accounting records don\u2019t just tell you about your bottom line, gross margin, or cost to produce; they\u2019re powerful records (if well kept) which can correlate your non-financial information with your financial ones. It can also tell you how your contracts are affecting your bottom line, how your new marketing strategy affects your sales, and a lot more.</p>\n<p>Bookkeeping is an easy process, especially for small companies and startups. What\u2019s difficult, other than making sure the numbers make sense, is translating them into actionable points.</p>\n<p>Here are a few urgent signs you need to start looking at your books, even if you hate to do so.</p>\n<h2>Bad gut feeling</h2>\n<p>I hate to say this, but it\u2019s true: entrepreneurs tend to shrug off the idea that something might be wrong with their financials. They do this either because they don\u2019t understand the financials or they just don\u2019t rely on them. The mere fact that you feel something is wrong means something <em>is</em> wrong. Don\u2019t let your gut feeling slip by.</p>\n<p>Check your financials every now and then (even if it\u2019s just to let your bookkeeper know that you get what he\u2019s doing). Here are a few things that you can easily check without an accounting background:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Cash balance</strong>: Check this in the bank and compare it with your accounting records. Even a moron can tell you that both should be equal (except for fintech startups where cash movements can be a bit messier). If there\u2019s a gap, it might be time to dig deeper.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Inventories and fixed assets</strong>: You should be able to roughly estimate the value of these items easily and compare it against your accounting records. It\u2019s not an exact science, but it should be pretty close.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Revenues and gross profit for the year</strong>: You should know these numbers by heart as a founder/entrepreneur. Why aren\u2019t we checking the bottom line? Because it\u2019s a bit more difficult, as you\u2019ve got other costs, expenses, and taxes that you might not be able to estimate.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Easy peasy. But don\u2019t take these numbers too seriously at the end of the day, though. Believe in your gut and understand the story behind your numbers.</p>\n<h2>You have or are looking for investors</h2>\n<p>Funding can be quite a messy exercise, and keeping your books in pristine shape is important if you have or are looking for external investors. The last thing you want to tell your investor is, \u201cHmm\u2026 I need to check with my accountant.\u201d</p>\n<p>Your existing investors expect to receive <i>quality</i>\u00a0financial reports that are true and fair. These don\u2019t have to look good, but they do need to reflect the actual state of your business. This is where your open-book clause will kick in, as your investors are likely to require you to undergo external audits to make sure they\u2019re comfortable with your numbers. However, audits don\u2019t help you in explaining your numbers to them. So, having a good knowledge of your books will help a great deal.</p>\n<p>When you pitch for funding, it\u2019s much more than a numbers Q&amp;A; it\u2019s about preparing yourself for financial due diligence. Many people think that investors are happy enough to hear about your story, numbers, and multiples. But the pitch is not the end of the discussion, my friend. You need to make your numbers, assumptions, and contracts ready for scrutiny in a data room. You don\u2019t want to be chasing the tail after the handshake is made.</p>\n<h2>Working capital hiccups</h2>\n<p>Working capital is frequently mentioned in finance-for-startups programs and is an important matter to consider in a business. Working capital is technically defined as your current assets minus your current liabilities. In most startup scenarios, it\u2019s simply your cash plus your receivables minus your payables. Now that\u2019s easy, right?</p>\n<p>You don\u2019t need to go back and look at your financials now to calculate that number; it\u2019s the operational impact that\u2019s important (for now, we won\u2019t discuss the cost of holding working capital).</p>\n<p>Working capital issues arise operationally when:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can\u2019t or don\u2019t collect what\u2019s due to you on time</li>\n<li>You struggle to pay your dues on time</li>\n<li>You tend to pay your dues too soon</li>\n<li>Your customers tend to maximize their payment terms</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are scenarios where you need to start looking at your books from an operational perspective and asking the right questions. Who are our lagging customers? Why do our customers pay so late (or don\u2019t pay at all)? Why am I struggling to pay my suppliers when my bottom line is positive?</p>\n<h2>Really, you\u2019re a large corporation</h2>\n<p>Or maybe, you should just stop playing small and stop calling yourself a startup. For a company that has grown beyond the startup phase, you need a finance officer. So, stop skimping on that.</p>", "spider_name": "techinasia", "id": "techinasia_430156", "has_funding_news": 0.43899381160736084}

This list of tips to help you generate more leads. Keep reading.</p>\n<h2>Optimize your LinkedIn profile</h2>\n<p>Your LinkedIn profile is like your company homepage. You can have the best content in the world, but if your homepage does not communicate its value proposition, you will lose your customer\u2019s interest. As\u00a0<a href=\"https://joshfechter.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"redactor-unlink\">Josh Fechter</span></a>, founder of\u00a0<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/growthmarketers/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Badass Marketers and Founders</a>\u00a0puts it, \u201cWhen people look at your profile, they decide whether you\u2019re worth connecting with in several seconds.\u201d</p>\n<p>LinkedIn is still a platform for professionals, which means your pictures must look professional.</p>\n<p>Contrary to popular belief, you do not need to be in a suit and tie to convey \u201cprofessionalism.\u201d As long as the photo is professionally taken and you look good, it\u2019ll work.</p>\n<p>Then, you have to optimize your cover photo. According to\u00a0Fechter, there are three kinds of photos that will increase your add-back percentage:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You with a relevant influencer in your industry</li>\n<li>You speaking in front of prospects</li>\n<li>You at a local landmark (this only works if you\u2019re connecting with people in your city)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>An example of a photo with a relevant influencer:</p>\n<p><img class=\"text-center aligncenter wp-image-430456\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/josh-fechter.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"639\" height=\"506\"></p>\n<p>Speaking in front of prospects:</p>\n<p><img class=\"text-center aligncenter wp-image-430457\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/shinjini-das.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"634\" height=\"480\"></p>\n<p>Local landmark:</p>\n<p><img class=\"text-center aligncenter wp-image-430455\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/hailey-friedman.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"636\" height=\"432\"></p>\n<p>Once again, this helps communicate professionalism, expertise, and social proof.</p>\n<p><b>Pro tip</b>:\u00a0To know if your profile is \u201coptimized\u201d enough, measure your add-back percentage, which is the percentage of connection requests you send out that get accepted.</p>\n<p>Now, it\u2019s time to work on your headline. Polishing up your LinkedIn profile is like writing a good sales letter\u2014lead with an attention-grabbing image, then hook their attention with a fantastic headline.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a good headline example:</p>\n<p><img class=\"text-center aligncenter wp-image-430454\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/aaron-zakowski.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"622\" height=\"490\"></p>\n<p>Next is your bio description. According to Fechter, the biggest mistake people make\u00a0is\u00a0not being specific in their bios. When glancing at the summary, you should be able to tell what the person does and how the person can help you. You can do this by writing a great value proposition. According to\u00a0<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://conversionxl.com/blog/value-proposition-examples-how-to-create/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">ConversionXL</a>, a good value proposition:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Uses clear language</li>\n<li>Communicates concrete results your prospect or customer will get</li>\n<li>Says how it\u2019s different or better than everyone else</li>\n<li>Avoids hype and jargon</li>\n<li>Can be read and understood in five seconds</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Get endorsements from your LinkedIn connections</h2>\n<p>You should optimize every aspect of your profile, including your endorsed skills. You can do this by\u00a0\u201ctrading\u201d endorsements.</p>\n<p>Message or email someone to endorse you while you endorse them back. Alternatively, to increase the likelihood of someone endorsing you, you can endorse the person first before messaging. A caveat: Because endorsements are so easily gamed, they may lose their value.</p>\n<p>According to strategy and content consultant <a href=\"http://benbradbury.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Ben Bradbury</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cOne thing I\u2019ve learned recently is how endorsements work. The real value lies in being endorsed by people who are highly skilled in the respective skill. When looking to increase your endorsements, focus on getting them from connections who are highly skilled.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>Build relationships with the influencer and then find a way to get him or her to endorse you.</p>\n<h2>Get more recommendations</h2>\n<p>Another aspect to optimize is your recommendations section. This area is usually neglected. For example, look at this:</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_430453\" class=\"wp-caption text-center aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"text-center wp-image-430453\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/sq-recommendations.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"581\" height=\"569\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sad AF. I don\u2019t even have a recommendations section?</p>\n</div>\n<p>To fill up your recommendations section, reach out to people you\u2019ve worked with. Get recommendations from your clients, ex-colleagues, current colleagues, or even teachers and professors while you were in school.</p>\n<p>While there is no fixed number, Fechter says that you should have a\u00a0minimum of five recommendations. So, go get them.</p>\n<h2>Build your connections</h2>\n<p>After you\u2019ve optimized your profile, it\u2019s time to build your connection base. However, don\u2019t blindly accept everyone on LinkedIn. As with building any social following, the most important thing you should wish for is\u00a0quality, not quantity.</p>\n<p>You may have a network of 10,000 connections, but if they\u2019re unrelated to your brand or those you want to reach, you won\u2019t get any engagement. Connect <em>only</em> with people who are your ideal customers, those that will buy your product or services, or those that will at least engage with the type of content you wish to create.</p>\n<p>So, how do you build your connection base?</p>\n<h3><b>Connect all your emails to your LinkedIn account</b></h3>\n<p>This tip is from growth marketer\u00a0Justin Wu, who said, \u201cThe first step would be to connect all your emails to your LinkedIn account. This will increase your audience size to help build your initial audience.\u201d</p>\n<p>Import every single email contact you have and connect with people. LinkedIn will automatically send out a connection request to them for you.</p>\n<p>First, click on \u201cMy Network\u201d in the LinkedIn menu. You should be redirected to this page, where you can click on more options:</p>\n<p><img class=\"text-center aligncenter wp-image-430447\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/linkedin-connect.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"691\" height=\"400\"></p>\n<p>Then, place your email accordingly and click continue.</p>\n<p><img class=\"text-center aligncenter wp-image-430448\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/linkedin-email-import.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"667\" height=\"378\"></p>\n<h3><b>Build connections through LinkedIn and Facebook groups</b></h3>\n<p>One of the best parts of being in a LinkedIn group is the ability to connect with anyone there. Join LinkedIn groups relevant to your niche or your ideal customers and then connect with them.</p>\n<p>Facebook groups\u00a0are another channel that you can tap for relevant connections. All you have to do is search for the relevant groups you think you should join, click \u201cJoin,\u201d and participate in the group. Then, you can create a thread asking to connect with everyone on LinkedIn.</p>\n<p><img class=\"text-center aligncenter size-full wp-image-430444\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/facebook-groups-create-a-thread.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1127\" height=\"455\"></p>\n<h3><b>Connect with everyone who has liked or commented on your content</b></h3>\n<p>This is what LinkedIn influencer\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/gillesdc/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Gilles De Clerck</a> suggests:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cLinkedIn posting has been a big deal these last few months. But what do all the views, likes, and comments mean? It means you have a potential audience. [I say] potential because one like doesn\u2019t equal a follower. That\u2019s why it\u2019s interesting to be able to reengage with these people at scale.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>All of the likes and comments you\u2019ve accumulated are wasted if you do not connect with them. They might see your content once, then forget you entirely. However, if you connect with them, they will remember you and see your content in the future.</p>\n<p>The thing is, without technology, this entire process can be a b*tch. So, if you want a quick and dirty (techy) way of doing this properly, read these two guides:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a class=\"markup--anchor markup--li-anchor\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ngwW-NGdvXnZY2Mu9UghfcmIMInyVSt0E0vubJiT82s/edit\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">How to extract LinkedIn Likers</a></li>\n<li><a class=\"markup--anchor markup--li-anchor\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wbJwG-WWUOkdBkWO2IP8cxw_UER9YibezSl1lc7EaII/edit\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">How to extract LinkedIn Commenters</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><b>Connect with everyone using tech</b></h3>\n<p>Love tech and automation? You\u2019re not alone. There<em> is</em> a way of building your connections using automation. Before you proceed, you need to have two tools:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://linkedhelper.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Linked Helper</a>\u00a0(automation tool)</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://business.linkedin.com/sales-solutions/sales-navigator#\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">LinkedIn Sales Navigator</a>\u00a0(without this, you\u2019ll get banned)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Then, follow this automation process from\u00a0<span class=\"redactor-unlink\">Fechter</span>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use LinkedIn Helper and write an invitation message</li>\n<li>Don\u2019t make it sales-y and focus on something in common</li>\n<li>Plug in a relevant search query into Sales Navigator and then connect all second contacts in the\u00a0search</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Pro tip</b>:\u00a0According to Fechter, don\u2019t connect with more than 150 people in a 24-hour period. You\u2019ll get banned.</p>\n<h2>Be consistent</h2>\n<p>In social media, consistency is king. Serial entrepreneur <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/creating-content-that-builds-your-personal-brand/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Gary Vee</a>\u00a0puts it quite simply:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201c\u2019OK, I started. Now what?\u2019 you ask. Keep doing it for another five years and then come back to me before you ask again.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>In fact, this is the single most common tip from all of the influencers I interviewed for this article.\u00a0<span class=\"redactor-unlink\">Thomas Ma</span>, the\u00a0founder of\u00a0<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"http://www.sapphireapps.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">SapphireApps</a>, said, \u201cI would say you need to post every single day. Keep your story simple and make sure to document as much as you can.\u201d</p>\n<h2>Know the formats that work on\u00a0LinkedIn</h2>\n<p>When I first started using LinkedIn, most people were simply sharing links to the articles they\u2019ve written themselves or the ones they read and liked. It turns out, this is a big mistake.</p>\n<p>According to startup strategist <a href=\"http://nextures.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Harsh Jani</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>One of the biggest mistakes I see on LinkedIn is something I made for many years: posting external links as your update. The most important thing for any platform is to keep users on the platform for as long as possible. So, when you post external links, LinkedIn will punish you by not rolling the content out to as many people as possible.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Wu, you shouldn\u2019t use links in your posts at all because LinkedIn favors native content. The algorithm favors these formats (in order of most to least reach):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Text</li>\n<li>Images</li>\n<li>LinkedIn videos (native)</li>\n<li>LinkedIn articles</li>\n<li>Links</li>\n<li>Videos (YouTube)</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>How to format a viral LinkedIn post</h2>\n<p>Here are the elements to make a good\u00a0LinkedIn post, as identified by influencers:</p>\n<h3><b>Use spacing to make it mobile-friendly</b></h3>\n<p>Most people now are getting their social media updates on their phone. This means that the content you write should be mobile-optimized as much as possible. One way to do this is to avoid writing in huge chunks of text. If you\u2019ve been on LinkedIn recently, you\u2019ve probably seen many people do this:</p>\n<p><img class=\"text-center aligncenter wp-image-430443\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/eleanor-goold.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"518\" height=\"627\"></p>\n<h3><b>Create a wave pattern when writing</b></h3>\n<p>In her\u00a0<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6307884703533932544\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Viral LinkedIn Checklist post</a>, serial entrepreneur\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/grettavanriel/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Gretta van Riel</a>\u00a0identified that writing in a wave pattern increases the consumption of her content. Growth marketing manager Hailey Friedman mentions the exact same thing in her\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.growthmarketingpro.com/how-to-go-viral-on-linkedin/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">How To Go Viral On LinkedIn</a>\u00a0blog post.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s the concept:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Start with a short sentence</li>\n<li>Make each subsequent sentence longer</li>\n<li>Gradually make the sentences shorter</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Fechter is a master in writing like this:</p>\n<p><img class=\"text-center aligncenter wp-image-430446\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/josh-fechter-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"517\" height=\"785\"></p>\n<p>Is there a psychological reason for why this works? To be honest, I have no idea. I\u2019ll update this post with more information when I discover the reason.</p>\n<h3><b>Write an engaging hook</b></h3>\n<p>Social media is all about grabbing the attention of your audience. If you don\u2019t capture it in the first five seconds, you\u2019ll have lost the person forever. That\u2019s why the most important thing is to write an engaging hook. In LinkedIn, your hook is the first two sentences, as readers will only see these before they have to click \u201csee more.\u201d</p>\n<p><img class=\"text-center aligncenter wp-image-430449\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/sq-hook.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"522\" height=\"199\"></p>\n<p>These sentences are your attention-grabber and headline. Spend 80 percent of your time on these to get your audience to read your copy.</p>\n<h3><b>Tell a story</b></h3>\n<p>As identified by researchers Chip and Dan Heath, stories are one of the main ingredients in sticky messages. Apply the same concept to LinkedIn.</p>\n<p>After capturing the attention of your audience, you must now tell an engaging story that will, in the words of the great copywriter Joseph Sugarman, \u201cbring them down the grease slide.\u201d</p>\n<p>How do you tell a great story?

Instead of following the conventional advice of telling your story chronologically, start your story in the middle (usually the emotional point). This guarantees your story to be gripping and emotional.</li>\n<li>Use any of these\u00a0<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--li-anchor\" href=\"https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/storytelling-formulas\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">proven storytelling formulas</a>, which have been used for years by Hollywood screenwriters, copywriters, and fiction authors to tell stories that sell.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><b>Add a CTA</b></h3>\n<p>LinkedIn favors posts that have high engagement. How do you get this? By asking. Close off your posts with a CTA. Directly ask your audience to do what you want them to do (like the post, comment, etc.) or get them to answer a question you have for them.</p>\n<h2>Engage and interact</h2>\n<p>One of the biggest mistakes people make on social media is forgetting to engage. Social media is increasingly turning into a one-to-one engagement platform. Engagement, not creation, is the name of the game on social media.</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><iframe class=\"giphy-embed\" src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/VGoh1NFc57zpe\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>According to Jani:</p>\n<blockquote><p>LinkedIn is transforming into the social networking for businesses. For you to be social, it is key to build and nurture relationships. \u200aI would say you should be spending four times as much time building relationships and interacting with people as you do creating the content.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Engage with influencers\u2019 content, reply to comments on your post, build up your network by connecting with people who comment on yours, and so on. It\u2019s an ever-hungry beast that you need to feed constantly.</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><iframe class=\"giphy-embed\" src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/fQZX2aoRC1Tqw\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<h2>Leverage influencers</h2>\n<p>One of the secrets behind LinkedIn\u2019s algorithm is this: If an influencer engages with your post, your post will be shown to all of his/her followers. In fact, this was how I got \u201clucky\u201d with my viral post.</p>\n<p>I wanted to share the fantastic piece of advice that Michaela Alexis had given me and tagged her in the post. She commented on it and my post got hundreds of likes as a result. While I don\u2019t recommend you do this often (because it looks like you\u2019re leveraging them for their following), you can do this skilfully. Here\u2019s an example:</p>\n<p><img class=\"text-center aligncenter wp-image-430442\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/brandon-redlinger.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"517\" height=\"400\"></p>\n<h2>Use engagement posts to turn followers into\u00a0emails</h2>\n<p>No matter how many followers you have on your LinkedIn profile, they don\u2019t belong to you; they belong\u00a0to LinkedIn.<strong>\u00a0</strong>At any point in time, you could be banned, removed, or blocked. This means that all your hard work could be destroyed overnight.</p>\n<p>The best thing you can do in this scenario is to drive your followers into a platform you can control (e.g. an email list). How can you do this? By offering them some kind of value in return.</p>\n<p>The method of delivery? An engagement post.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s what Fechter says:</p>\n<blockquote><p>To turn your engagement into email subscribers, you can offer a relevant download or ask them for their opinion on a content release. For example, I asked my LinkedIn connections for their opinion on my book cover while providing a link to get notified when the book comes out.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Create a post that gives them a direct download, ask them to comment on your post, then send them a link to your landing page.</p>\n<h2>Use video</h2>\n<p>Native video is a new LinkedIn feature. Because it\u2019s so new, there aren\u2019t many people that know what to do with it or how to make it work. With video, the same principles I\u2019ve laid out apply:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be consistent</li>\n<li>Tell stories</li>\n<li>Create an engaging hook</li>\n</ul>\n<p>LinkedIn influencer <a href=\"https://stringstory.co/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">String Nguyen</a>\u00a0has done this expertly:</p>\n<p><img class=\"text-center aligncenter wp-image-430450\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/string-nguyen.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"492\" height=\"803\"></p>\n<p>She suggests using your phone since it\u2019s connected to the internet, fits in your pocket, and can push out content quickly. She also mentioned that one-take videos, while difficult to pull off, are great ways to \u201cshow your brains.\u201d</p>\n<h2>No reason to\u00a0struggle</h2>\n<p>If you were struggling to understand LinkedIn and generating the kind of views and reach that could catapult your business, then congratulations. I\u2019ve just handed you the keys to LinkedIn domination from some of the best experts who are killing it on LinkedIn.</p>\n<p>All you have to do now is take action and put in the work. Your hard work will pay off.</p>\n<p><em>This article was originally published on the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/viral-on-linkedin\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">ReferralCandy blog</a>.\u00a0</em></p>", "spider_name": "techinasia", "id": "techinasia_429333", "has_funding_news": 0.375188946723938}

That really made me happy because we tried getting into their\u00a0offline\u00a0school twice but received negative responses.</p>\n<p>YC is one of the largest startup accelerators in the world. It was founded in 2005, and now-famous companies like Stripe, Airbnb, Weebly, Optimizely, Dropbox, Reddit, MixPanel, and Twitch have gone through the program.</p>\n<p>During the accelerator program, YC invests US$120,000 for 7 percent of a company. It\u2019s fairly difficult to get into that.</p>\n<p>So, I was glad YC decided to expand their horizons and organized their first\u00a0online\u00a0school. It\u2019s free and YC does not invest or take any stake in the companies.</p>\n<p id=\"e01e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">I submitted my application as soon as I found out about the new online school. A few days later, I got a letter saying my application had been accepted. Awesome! I was so happy that I even printed out the letter and\u00a0<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1493103620751431&amp;set=a.773144942747306.1073741827.100001554224651&amp;type=3&amp;theater\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1493103620751431&amp;set=a.773144942747306.1073741827.100001554224651&amp;type=3&amp;theater\">posted</a>\u00a0my happy face on Facebook.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-430332\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/vladimir-email-accepted-750x554.jpeg\" alt=\"vladimir-email-accepted\" width=\"542\" height=\"400\"></p>\n<p id=\"8201\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">On the very same day, I was added to a group chat and a closed group. Thus began my time with YC Startup School!</p>\n<p id=\"2c96\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">So, what was this school like?</p>\n<h2 id=\"c9ed\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h3-strong\">Groups and\u00a0chats</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"e198\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">The first thing we did was join a\u00a0general chat group (aka the \u201ctown square\u201d). There, we could share messages that were visible to all the participants of the online school.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">On the first day, we mostly just got to know each other. Later on, there were different discussions in this channel. People collected feedback, discussed pricing, looked for developers, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"7939\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">All of the participants were\u00a0broken up into groups according to time zones. My startup, AcademyOcean, landed in group #25. Each group had its own separate chat channel, which was a much more comfortable environment compared to the general channel. Everyone got to know each other right away, but just through chat messages, as we hadn\u2019t seen each other\u2019s faces yet.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Soon, our mentor, Vishal Joshi, joined the group and let us know that the first office hours would be held on Wednesday and that we\u2019d have to attend. But what exactly were office hours?</p>\n<h2 id=\"d45c\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h3-strong\">Office hours</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"516c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">At the designated time, we were sent a link that directed us to a conference call. All the startups in our group were there. Vishal told us what his company,\u00a0<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://withjoy.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"https://withjoy.com/\">Joy</a>, does and suggested an interesting format for our discussion right off the bat. Each startup would share its pitch, and then Vishal would choose a random group member to summarize what he had heard and gotten out of the pitch. Each member got to speak.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">This format achieved several things at once:</p>\n<ul class=\"postList\">\n<li id=\"58c0\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">The speaker tried to convey his message as clearly as possible.</li>\n<li id=\"b36c\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Everyone was paying close attention because no one knew who would have to do the summary next.</li>\n<li id=\"37b0\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">If the summary didn\u2019t go well, the one doing the pitch would know that he could have articulated his ideas better.</li>\n<li id=\"6c00\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">After each pitch and summary, Vishal gave his feedback.</li>\n</ul>\n<p id=\"6b51\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">I wound up having to give a summary first.</p>\n<p id=\"7125\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This is how we looked during office hours:</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-430333\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/get-to-know-chat-750x322.png\" alt=\"get-to-know-chat\" width=\"750\" height=\"322\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"2a57\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h3-strong\">Group #25</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"fc31\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Our group was very interesting. There were\u00a022 companies\u00a0represented, but there were usually 12 to 15 of us present during office hours. The\u00a0companies came from eight different countries, namely Ukraine, Russia, Belarus, Turkey, Romania, Israel, Greece, and Uganda. But since they were all based in similar time zones, it was convenient to conduct office hours at the same time.</p>\n<p id=\"33ad\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">We never crossed paths with some of the people in our group (presumably they didn\u2019t participate), but here\u2019s a list of those who actively participated:</p>\n<ul>\n<li id=\"0909\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"http://academyocean.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"http://academyocean.com\">AcademyOcean</a></li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"http://www.boxifier.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"http://www.boxifier.com\">Boxifier</a></li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"http://coorpa.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"http://coorpa.com/\">Coorpa</a></li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/cowicomm/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"https://www.facebook.com/cowicomm/\">Covert Wireless Communications (CWC)</a></li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"http://lungpass.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"http://lungpass.com\">Lung Passport</a></li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">HomeSlice</li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"http://kickcityapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"http://kickcityapp.com/\">KickCity</a></li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"http://metatask.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"http://metatask.io\">Metatask</a></li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.myzyng.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"https://www.myzyng.com\">MyZyng</a></li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Nopono</li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"http://radario.cc/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"http://radario.cc\">Radario</a></li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://payrainbow.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"https://payrainbow.com\">Rainbow</a></li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://sockam.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"https://Sockam.com\">Sockam</a></li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.sporteventus.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"https://www.sporteventus.com/\">Sporteventus</a></li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/heylocalpanda\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"https://www.facebook.com/heylocalpanda\">Local Panda</a></li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"http://xor.ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"http://xor.ai/\">XOR</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p id=\"26aa\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">We all got along very well. Everyone tried to help each other out by giving constructive feedback. Many of us still talk on Facebook now, as the connections we made have been very valuable.</p>\n<h2 id=\"8bda\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h3-strong\">Mentoring</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"ac15\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Vishal\u2019s product went through YC\u2019s offline school, and he told us all sorts of interesting things about how\u00a0his company grew 30 times over during his time with the Summer 2016 batch. Vishal has a great deal of experience, so it was helpful for all of us to hear his opinions about our products, positioning, markets, etc.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_430336\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-430336 size-large\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/mentor-joy-750x438.png\" alt=\"mentor-joy\" width=\"750\" height=\"438\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A photo of Vishal Joshi.</p>\n</div>\n<p id=\"576a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">It was interesting to me that the time for our office hours (6 pm GMT +3) was early morning for Vishal, and he was always on time. I bet it was not easy for him.</p>\n<p id=\"e3aa\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Outside of the weekly office hours, we could talk with Vishal one on one, but we weren\u2019t able to do so often because of his schedule. The personal calls we had, however, were very helpful. These conversations were like talking to a good friend who wants to help and share his knowledge with you.</p>\n<p id=\"f56a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">By the way, I showed the draft of this article to Vishal, and he said that if anyone has questions about their startups, he will be happy to help. You can reach out to him via\u00a0<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"mailto:vishal@withjoy.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"mailto:vishal@withjoy.com\">email</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"77b7\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h3-strong\">Startup map</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"a451\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Another interesting feature we had access to was\u00a0the startup map. Each startup could mark its location on a map and see its neighbors. This was very handy for certain markets or if you just wanted to make friends with people from different companies in various locations.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-430337\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/startup-map-750x428.png\" alt=\"startup-map\" width=\"750\" height=\"428\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"8783\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h3-strong\">Lectures</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"214c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">For me,\u00a0one of the most important things about the YC Startup School apart from networking were the lectures. Each week, we got access to two 50-minute lectures on various topics that are useful for startups (e.g. how to come up with ideas, how to measure the right KPIs, how to build products, how to get use cases, how to find product-market fit, etc.) Personally, I enjoyed\u00a0Alan Kay\u2019s lectures the most, which talked about how to invent the future.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-430338\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/alan-kay-lecture.png\" alt=\"alan-kay-lecture\" width=\"723\" height=\"457\"></p>\n<p id=\"be0e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">At 77 years old, he is a sharp thinker. He\u2019s an extraordinary combination of an engineer (he was one of the fathers of object-oriented programming) and an artist (he\u2019s a composer, guitarist, and theatrical designer). I highly recommend getting to know his life story.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fd1a\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h3-strong\">Updates and\u00a0metrics</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"7204\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Another important detail of the YC Startup School was\u00a0the weekly report. Each of us had to choose a metric for our company and set a goal to grow it in a week.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Then, in the office hours, everyone would discuss their successes. But we couldn\u2019t do this by talking about what we <em>tried</em> to do. We had to talk about what we\u00a0<em>accomplished</em>. In other words, if you reached your goal, you did well, and you\u2019d get an even higher goal for the following week (usually 10 percent higher). If we didn\u2019t reach our goal, we tried to figure out why and make a decision on what could be done better next week.</p>\n<p id=\"f674\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">When the YC Startup School began, AcademyOcean hardly had any learners, so I chose the metric \u201cnumber of demos conducted for potential clients.\u201d But toward the end of the program, I changed it to \u201cnumber of learners.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b796\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">(If the YC program were starting now, I would choose a metric involving money. For a SaaS company, this is usually MRR or monthly recurring revenue.)</p>\n<h2 id=\"9598\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h3-strong\">Virtual demo day</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"084f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">The nine weeks flew by.\u00a0We had our group calls, we talked, we shared our successes and failures, we received feedback, and we grew our startups. It was very interesting to track the successes of other people\u2019s companies, and this empowered us to grow our own startups.</p>\n<p id=\"64d5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The 10th week came.\u00a0It was time for us to prepare our\u00a0final videos. The startups in the offline YC school present their products onstage on the demo day.\u00a0But we couldn\u2019t do that because, first of all, we couldn\u2019t be physically present on the demo day. Secondly, there were far more of us enrolled in the online school than in the offline school, so an event like that would have taken several days to complete. That\u2019s why we just had a virtual demo day.</p>\n<p id=\"974e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Each team worked on the scripts for the videos, and we improved our work as we received feedback.\u00a0There were strict criteria for what the videos should and should not include.</p>\n<p id=\"d2b7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Here\u2019s our first video:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/d_uLpov7zaM?rel=0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">After all our edits, here\u2019s how it looked when we submitted it:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GawAB4kenMY?rel=0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<h2><strong>Completion</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"2a8e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">After a few days, all the teams that completed the program\u2019s assignments were sent\u00a0certificates of completion\u00a0in the mail.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-430339\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/startup-school-certificate-vladimir-750x578.png\" alt=\"startup-school-certificate-vladimir\" width=\"750\" height=\"578\"></p>\n<p id=\"0b41\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">I\u2019m delighted that we made it into the YC Startup School.

Image credit: Joshua Koo.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Halfway through his one-year sabbatical, Bjorn Lee panicked.</p>\n<p>After working in Zopim \u2013 a Singapore company which made its founders millionaires after getting <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/singapores-zopim-acquired-zendesk\">acquired</a> by US customer service software Zendesk \u2013 Lee sensed it was time to leave and find a new adventure.</p>\n<p>Except that he was stuck.</p>\n<p>\u201cI had an existential crisis,\u201d he tells me. \u201cI tried a lot of stupid ideas. When you start a new company, you always think about what\u2019s trendy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Prior to joining Zopim, Lee did his own startup in Silicon Valley and secured funding from the likes of Google Ventures and 500 Startups.</p>\n<p>In his second go-round, he wasn\u2019t keen to chase just another hot idea. So he sifted through his passions one by one to find something that could make money.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t make money from Lego. I can\u2019t make money from robots or farming,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Eventually, he settled on mindfulness, a scientifically-proven process of bringing one\u2019s attention to experiences happening in the present moment, which can be nurtured through meditation.</p>\n<p>Lee has been a mindfulness buff since 2011. After sitting in a 10-day silent retreat in India, he tried meditating for an hour a day after that.</p>\n<p>It was too difficult. Yet, inspired by the book <em>Search Inside Yourself,</em> written by mindfulness guru and ex-Googler Tan Chade-Meng, he came across the concept of taking one mindful breath a night, and building a habit from there.</p>\n<p>That became the genesis of his new startup.</p>\n<h2>\u201cEye-opening\u201d meditation</h2>\n<p>Today, Lee meditates 12 minutes each morning, monitoring his brain waves with a <a href=\"http://www.choosemuse.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Muse headband</a>.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s also on a mission to make everyone more mindful, and <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/feeling-it/201309/20-scientific-reasons-start-meditating-today\" target=\"_blank\">improve our ability</a> to focus and be more productive.</p>\n<p>The manifestation of that aim, as it often goes with startups, begins with an app.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/mindfi-screenshots.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"815\" height=\"723\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-430262\"></p>\n<p>Called <a href=\"http://mindfi.co/\" target=\"_blank\">MindFi</a>, it provides three-minute guided meditation exercises that fit into people\u2019s daily routines. It even comes with a focus timer after each routine to help them stay on task.</p>\n<p>I tried one of the sessions on the app. \u201cNow pick up the bottle and hold it in your hand,\u201d narrates the calm voice of Toby Ouvry, an ex-monk who has joined MindFi.</p>\n<p>He continues: \u201cWhen you\u2019re ready, I\u2019d like you take a sip of the water, but do it slowly without being in a hurry. Often, we\u2019re gulping our water unconsciously when we\u2019re drinking. Take a nice, slow, leisurely sip. And before you swallow it, just allow your tongue and your month to swirl around the water a little bit.\u201d</p>\n<p>The exercises can be done with open eyes, and are often designed around habits like eating and commuting.</p>\n<p>Another session I tried was amusing. \u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking, why are we doing mindfulness in the toilet?\u201d says the voice in another session titled Restroom Solace as birds chirp in the background.</p>\n<h2>Mindful of the competition</h2>\n<p>At the time of this writing, the app is still in \u201cpre-launch\u201d, though you can download it on iOS and Android. It has seen interest from investors.</p>\n<p>Lee raised a six-digit seed round from Zopim founders Royston Tay and Kwok Yang Bin, as well as prominent Singapore-based angels Wong Poh Kam and Chow Yen Lu. All of them meditate.</p>\n<p>However, MindFi is entering a space with two dominant players: Headspace and Calm.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/mindfi.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"638\" height=\"367\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-429543\"></p>\n<p>Lee explains that the app differentiates by focusing on short sessions specifically designed to fit into people\u2019s routines.</p>\n<p>And while MindFi\u2019s exercises have a practical flavor \u2013 a session asks you to reflect on how a work conversation could\u2019ve gone better \u2013 the other apps promote meditation for its own sake.</p>\n<p>Tack on the focus timer, and MindFi becomes a day-long companion for the novice mindfulness student.</p>\n<p>But is it useful enough to get to hundreds of thousands of users? Is the app effective at making mindfulness a habit? And how does he prevent copying?</p>\n<p>Lee aims to make MindFi even more distinct. He is not trying to get everyone to meditate. \u201cWe see ourselves as an attention coach,\u201d says Lee, declining to go on-the-record about specific plans.</p>\n<p>\u201cDistraction is the new fat. If you\u2019re fat, you run. If you\u2019re distracted, you meditate. Because meditation is the best way to train attention,\u201d he adds.</p>\n<p>He does plan to charge a subscription fee for mindfulness content, just like Headspace and Calm, and is looking at a business-to-business play as well.</p>\n<p>He has also engaged researchers at SMU, Yale-NUS, and IMH to use MindFi as part of a slate of studies to test the effects of mindfulness on users.</p>\n<p>Then there is the issue of mindfulness having a limited audience of Burning Man-going technophiles, especially in Asia (I\u2019m exaggerating, of course).</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">I was waking up at 3 or 4am, and my chest pains came back.</blockquote>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll agree that there\u2019s less stigma about meditation in the West than in Asia, ironically. Meditation really started from here,\u201d says Lee.</p>\n<p>Consider also the fact that Headspace, the leading meditation app, is only valued in the hundreds of millions. Spotify, in contrast, is valued at US$13 billion and Didi Chuxing over US$50 billion.</p>\n<p>While this means there\u2019s potentially an untapped market in mindfulness, it also means there\u2019s a lot of convincing to do.</p>\n<p>Although Lee is based in Singapore, he\u2019ll market the app globally.</p>\n<p>He plans to launch on product discovery platform <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Product Hunt</a> soon, whose largest traffic source is techies and early adopters in the US.</p>\n<h2>Chest pains</h2>\n<p>Lee understands stress intimately. Things reached peak craziness for him after the Zopim acquisition, when he was tasked with running integration between the startup and its new parent Zendesk.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt was a stressful moment, to be honest. I was waking up at 3 or 4am, and my chest pains came back. I was running a big team of 10 people and we had to interface with five cities across the world,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Because Zendesk is used by customer support staff everywhere, he saw first-hand the daily pressures they face.</p>\n<p>As a result, he was able to better empathize and understand the different kinds of stress in various industries, and that was one of the seeds that eventually led to MindFi.</p>\n<p>\u201cCan I build something more direct to help these guys?\u201d he asked.</p>\n<p>\u201cBecause I also have the same problems.\u201d</p>", "spider_name": "techinasia", "id": "techinasia_430290", "has_funding_news": 0.3051449656486511}

It\u2019s now registered in Estonia for the launch of its ICO on October 31. The dissolving national boundaries in its footprint is typical of the blockchain technology underpinning Cashaa.</p>\n<p>CEO and founder Kumar Gaurav, currently based in Palo Alto, USA, tells <em>Tech in Asia</em> that the pre-ICO activity of bringing in influential investors will start a couple of weeks ahead of the public launch. Cashaa will release 510 million CAS tokens for 150,000 ETH (the cryptocurrency ethereum), says Gaurav. At the current price of ethereum, that would amount to US$44 million.</p>\n<p>Unlike many ICOs based on whitepapers, points out Gaurav, Cashaa has a proven product for remittances or money transfers between England and India, as well as Nigeria and Indonesia. It also has a digital wallet and acts as an exchange for cryptocurrency.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">The legal preparation for the ICO has taken months and cost hundreds of thousands of dollars\u2026 That\u2019s worth it to protect our reputation.</blockquote>\n<p>The way its remittance works does not require users to know anything about cryptocoins. They can simply use their national currency to transfer money. A trader on the platform sells bitcoin in exchange for the fiat currency in the country where the transfer originates. Another trader in the receiving country buys the bitcoin, paying for it in the local currency there. This goes to the receiver, who need not know that a bitcoin trade powers the money transfer and exchange rate.</p>\n<p>This can bring the power of cryptocoins to 99.99 percent of the people in the world who have no clue about them, says Gaurav. It reduces the cost and time taken for remittances by banks. That\u2019s huge for countries like India and Indonesia with a large diaspora across the world sending money home.</p>\n<p>Other companies like Ripple, which connects banks with its private blockchain network, are also trying to use cryptocurrency to reduce the cost of money transfer. One difference with Cashaa is that it will be crytocoin agnostic to improve liquidity, explains Gaurav, unlike Ripple which mainly works with its XRP token.</p>\n<p>The money it raises from the ICO will help Cashaa get licences in more countries to increase its remittance channels. But remittances is just the first large use case to demonstrate the value and robustness of the underlying blockchain technology, explains Gaurav. Post-ICO, Cashaa will expand its repertoire to become a broader blockchain-based financial services platform, with products for lending, cross-border investments, and more. The CAS token can be used to execute a trade on the Cashaa platform.</p>\n<h2>A la Omise coin</h2>\n<p>The closest to this business model is Thai payments startup <a href=\"https://www.omise.co/\" target=\"_blank\">Omise</a> that launched an <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/omise-acquires-paysbuy\">ICO in July</a> to build an ethereum-based OmiseGo product for peer-to-peer payments and money transfers. OmiseGo is expected to be launched in the next quarter.</p>\n<p>By the end of last month, the value of the US$25 million worth of OMG token had risen forty-fold to cross US$1 billion, making Omise an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/31/the-first-ico-unicorns-are-here/\" target=\"_blank\">ICO unicorn</a>.</p>\n<p>Cashaa will be hoping that its CAS token sees a meteoric rise like Omise\u2019s, and not the fate that has befallen many ICOs in China where they were <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/china-bans-icos\">banned</a> earlier this month.</p>\n<p>Gaurav welcomes the regulatory scrutiny, provided it doesn\u2019t throw the baby out with the bathwater. He reiterates that Cashaa has a working product with over 12,000 users even before the ICO. Some token crowdsales in China have been get-rich-quick schemes based only on dubious whitepapers, or rushed attempts to hop on the ICO bandwagon that has <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/ico-tracker/\" target=\"_blank\">raised nearly US$2 billion</a> in the past six months.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>See: <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/china-ico-ban-uncertainty\">China\u2019s blockchain industry looks overseas as ICO blanket ban stirs fear</a></strong></p>\n<p>One reason why he shifted to the US was to make the CAS token \u2013 which will represent Cashaa products and not its equity \u2013 legally airtight. The holding company for the ICO is in Estonia, which is more advanced and open-minded in adopting and regulating blockchain and cryptocoins than most other countries. \u201cThe preparation for the ICO has taken months and cost hundreds of thousands of dollars,\u201d says Gaurav. \u201cBut that\u2019s worth it because we have a reputation to protect as an early adopter and evangelist of blockchain technology.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cashaa is currently ranked 60th in a leaderboard maintained by UK-based Rise on the <a href=\"https://www.rise.global/blockchain-100\" target=\"_blank\">top 100 most influential blockchain companies</a> in the world. Gaurav also figures in an algorithmically generated <a href=\"https://richtopia.com/inspirational-people/blockchain-top-100\" target=\"_blank\">Richtopia list</a> of the top 100 most influential people in the cryptosphere.</p>\n<h2>The ICO autobahn</h2>\n<p>A number of startups in India are weighing the pros and cons of taking the ICO route to raise funds. For Gaurav, the choice was both philosophical and practical. Cashaa was seed-funded and founded in 2016 to demonstrate the power of blockchain technology in real-world use cases, so it\u2019s a natural extension to now raise money with digital coins. The practical side of it is that Gaurav and his co-founders can continue to build the company without diluting their equity or having VCs calling the shots.</p>\n<p>Gaurav had earlier founded Darwinsurance, a peer-to-peer insurance platform in Italy after completing his master\u2019s in business management in Milan. This was acquired by Esedra.</p>\n<p>His co-founder Celestine Vettical had founded Perfomix, acquired by Baker Hughes. He had earlier held senior positions at Microsoft, SAP, and Cognizant.</p>\n<p>Another co-founder Janina Lowisz is also the co-founder of Bitnation, which characterizes itself as a decentralized nation on the blockchain. The fourth co-founder Felice Covelli is a financial asset manager and a bitcoin pioneer in Europe.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>See: <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/ico-overview\">Everything you wanted to know about initial coin offerings but were afraid to ask</a></strong></p>\n<p>Cashaa lists MIT research scientist John Henry Clippinger among its advisors. He was also the advisor for Bancor, which raised US$153 million in an ICO in June \u2013 the largest ever token sale until then. It was overtaken the next month by a <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/hong-kong-company-raises-185m-recordbreaking-initial-coin-offering\">US$185-million token sale</a> by Chinese company Block.one.</p>\n<p>Other advisors include Bernard Lietaer, creator of the Euro and author of <em>The Future of Money</em>, as well as Kumar Gaurav\u2019s younger brother Akash Gaurav, who founded blockchain company Auxesis in 2015 during his undergrad studies at premier engineering college IIT Bombay.</p>\n<p>Auxesis is building the blockchain infrastructure for a variety of clients, including state governments in India looking to use distributed ledgers for things like land records. For Cashaa, it has built the core private blockchain network, taking care of performance, scalability, and security.</p>", "spider_name": "techinasia", "id": "techinasia_430118", "has_funding_news": 0.38795211911201477}

I was instantly impressed with its ability to monetize my unwanted belongings with speed and simplicity. Every sale felt like I was getting free money since the other alternatives were letting items collect dust at home or\u00a0donating/throwing them away. From then on, I used the app extensively to buy used items for my new flat and later to sell most of my belongings when I left Singapore (adding US$5,000 to my bank account).</p>\n<p>Carousell\u2019s core value proposition is that you can buy and sell your items in just a few clicks. What\u2019s exciting to me is that this service is making the used consumer economy sexier. In turn, it is activating idle consumer inventory, unlocking new household wealth, and addressing the huge problem of waste that plagues our consumption-driven economy.</p>\n<p>I set out to improve the customer experience of the iOS app by reducing as much friction as possible from the buying and selling process.

I listened to my recordings and put each noteworthy finding into one of three buckets: what users said, did, and thought or felt (based on non-verbal cues).</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_430049\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-430049\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Carousell-redesign-5.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Categorizing research insights.</p>\n</div>\n<h3><b>Affinity mapping</b></h3>\n<p>Next, I sorted these insights by order of affinity, grouping them into dedicated pain-point buckets.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_430071\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-430071\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Carousell-redesign-23.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Affinity mapping.</p>\n</div>\n<p>During the process, I prioritized pain points by frequency\u00a0and decided to focus only on the issues that came up with at least three of six participants, putting the others on hold for later validation.</p>\n<p>I still had eight pain points left, which were still too many to focus on for the scope of this case study. In order of frequency, they were:</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_430053\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\" wp-image-430053\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Carousell-redesign-8.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"591\" height=\"335\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Top 8 pain points from usability testing.</p>\n</div>\n<h3><b>2\u00d72 prioritization matrix</b></h3>\n<p>The next step was to prioritize the above pain points. For that, I used a 2\u00d72 matrix. I plotted the pain points on four quadrants based on their importance to a user and to Carousell.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_430055\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter text-center text-center\">\n<img class=\" wp-image-430055\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Carousell-redesign-9.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"582\" height=\"494\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">2\u00d72 prioritization matrix: sell and buy side.</p>\n</div>\n<p>The prioritization exercise showed that the most important pain points for both users and the app were on the sell side of the workflow. This is in line with Carousell\u2019s own focus on the <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/carousells-big-goal-sell-product-3-seconds\" rel=\"nofollow\">seller experience</a>.</p>\n<p>From here on, I decided to focus entirely on the seller persona and the following associated pain points:</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_430059\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-430059\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Carousell-redesign-12.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1538\" height=\"444\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Top 4 pain points on the sell side.</p>\n</div>\n<h3><b>USMO</b></h3>\n<p>After understanding the key problem area, I decided to dive deeper into John (the seller persona). The first step was to use a mostly divergent thinking process called USMO (user, situation, motivation, and outcome) to help me generate user scenarios.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-430045\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Carousell-redesign-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"462\"></p>\n<p>Completing the USMO exercise was a natural segue into creating several key job stories for John.</p>\n<h3><b>Jobs-to-be-done</b></h3>\n<p>I used the\u00a0<a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/09/know-your-customers-jobs-to-be-done?\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">jobs-to-be-done framework</a> to explore various situations, associated motivations, and desired outcomes that Carousell sellers may be experiencing. This culminated into artifacts called <a href=\"https://jtbd.info/replacing-the-user-story-with-the-job-story-af7cdee10c27\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">job stories</a>:</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_430073\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-430073\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Carousell-redesign-25.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"774\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">3 job stories for John.</p>\n</div>\n<h3><b>Scenarios</b></h3>\n<p>Using job stories, I wanted to further embody the holistic user journey beyond the use of the app. I sketched out several scenarios using storyboards, which depicted the user journeys in line with the three job stories above.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_430051\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-430051\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Carousell-redesign-6.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Story board scenarios (my sketching skills have somehow remained stagnant since grade two).</p>\n</div>\n<p>The above synthesis and production of UX artifacts allowed me to embody John as the seller persona more deeply.</p>\n<h2><b>Ideating and prototyping</b></h2>\n<p>The next part of the process involved diving into the pain points, mapping out the relevant task flows, and ideating solutions via paper UI prototypes. Once I settled on a finalized version, paper prototypes were converted into high-fidelity prototypes that were ready for testing using <a href=\"https://www.sketchapp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Sketch</a> and <a href=\"https://marvelapp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Marvelapp</a>.</p>\n<p>I kept in mind the app\u2019s core growth metrics\u00a0and hypothesized design changes that would have a positive impact on them. In a follow-up process, I ran tests on these hypotheses using rigorous split testing on Carousell\u2019s iOS app.</p>\n<p>Now, let\u2019s dive into the process in detail.</p>\n<p>Being able to list an item quickly and easily is critical for both users and the app. From the user interviews, there were two points of friction when listing: difficulty taking the photo and choosing the right category.</p>\n<h3><b>Pain point 1: Taking and choosing photos for new\u00a0listings</b></h3>\n<p>Four out of six users had a frustrating experience taking and choosing photos for their new listing. Users did not immediately realize that you could choose multiple photos in the photo library. Some users also expected the photo they took to show up automatically as the default photo for the listing. The delayed appearance of a photo in the camera reel definitely contributed to this frustration.</p>\n<p><b>Task flow</b></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_430046\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-430046\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Carousell-redesign-3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"907\" height=\"519\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Task flow 1: Taking and choosing photo(s) for new listing.</p>\n</div>\n<p><b>Solution</b>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Add a feature where a photo can be auto-selected in the camera reel.</li>\n<li>Add a highlighted reminder that users can choose up to four photos.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img class=\"text-center aligncenter wp-image-430064\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Carousell-redesign-16.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"613\" height=\"1032\"></p>\n<h3><b>Pain point 2: Choosing the right category for listings</b></h3>\n<p>Five out of six users were frustrated when choosing the right category for the item they wanted to sell. These findings are clearly item-dependent. In this case, users were asked to sell laptops, phones, and watches. This shows that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The category list is too long</li>\n<li>There\u2019s no clear hierarchy</li>\n<li>There\u2019s no way to search for a category</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Task flow</b></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_430044\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-430044\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Carousell-redesign-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1019\" height=\"711\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Task flow 2: Choosing Categories for new listing.</p>\n</div>\n<p><b>Solution</b>:<b>\u00a0</b>Create a new, two-level categorization map based on competitor research and maintaining old Carousell categories.</p>\n<p>I started out by researching categorization best practices from the main ecommerce and classifieds sites/apps. As a result, I created a preliminary two-level categorization schema that would holistically cover most items that would be listed on Carousell. For sub-categories, I re-allocated the app\u2019s old categories and added new ones to the Electronics category.</p>\n<p>My research findings and recommended schema can be found <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18O1b7buRF37iXYvvZnBF4g52Sdvr47l5HgIj1zyQGUk/edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"text-center aligncenter wp-image-430065\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Carousell-redesign-17.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"660\" height=\"606\"></p>\n<p><b>Caveat</b>:<b> </b>I know that this is a fairly substantial revamp that will carry significant front- and back-end technical implications. Here are a couple of ways I can see this being rolled out:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Map all listings to the new categorization schema using generic buckets like \u201cOther\u201d to slot those listings that don\u2019t fit the new schema. This is the approach I used in the above research.</li>\n<li>Maintain the old categorization schema on existing listings, while rolling out an entirely new schema for listings. Over time, the old categorization will naturally be substituted by the new one.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(Update: Since beginning this case study, Carousell has released their categorization revamp where they updated some category labels and added an additional level as a drop down under the main category name. I believe this is a much neater solution than what I have proposed. Hats off to Carousell\u2019s design team!)</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_430057\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter text-center\">\n<img class=\" wp-image-430057\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Carousell-redesign-10.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"566\" height=\"180\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Updated categorization hierarchy.</p>\n</div>\n<h3><b>Pain point 3: Difficulty editing listings</b></h3>\n<p>Users were unable to easily locate the edit button\u00a0and clicked on the price or item name directly in the listing summary page. Only two out of six users found the edit button with ease.</p>\n<p><b>Solution</b>: Change the edit icon to the word \u201cEdit\u201d and put it in line with other top-of-screen cues. Enlarge it for visibility.</p>\n<p><img class=\"text-center aligncenter wp-image-430060\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Carousell-redesign-13.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"652\" height=\"716\"></p>\n<h3><b>Pain point 4: Confusion about the promote feature</b></h3>\n<p>Only two out of six users clicked on the promote button at the bottom, and every user was unclear as to what \u201cpromote\u201d meant. Upon further questioning, almost everyone thought this was an internal promotion that Carousell uses and assumed it would cost money. Users also did not know the difference between the social sharing function and promotion.</p>\n<p>As illustrated in the task flow below, there are two zones of action leading to the same process.</p>\n<p><b>Task flow</b></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_430047\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-430047\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Carousell-redesign-4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1187\" height=\"519\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Task Flow 3: Finding more buyers for own listing.</p>\n</div>\n<p><b>Solution</b>: Redesign the promote feature and listing view architecture for clarity and open up the opportunity for monetization.</p>\n<p>This was the most challenging pain point to address using design. After two iterations, I settled on a design that I don\u2019t like 100 percent\u00a0but felt was a solid step forward with the scope of the project.</p>\n<p>My objectives here were to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provide more clarity on what the promote feature is</li>\n<li>Clean up the listing view architecture</li>\n<li>Open space up for payable promotion features for Carousell to drive revenue,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/03/classifieds-app-carousell-exploring-premium-listings-services-to-bring-in-revenue.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">which is a new priority for Carousell</a>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img class=\"text-center aligncenter wp-image-430077\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/1n0vR4ThSORfKCq-blAnuw.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"654\" height=\"893\"></p>\n<p>Only three out of six users clicked on the promote button. The three that didn\u2019t click assumed that they would have to pay to get their item promoted. They didn\u2019t realize they could share via social media instead.</p>\n<p>If I had more time, I would have tried the following design changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Highlight on the button that the promotion is free (e.g. \u201cPromote for Free\u201d)</li>\n<li>Include a help box when the user sees the listing view for the first time</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img class=\"text-center aligncenter wp-image-430070\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Carousell-redesign-22.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"245\" height=\"125\"></p>\n<p>You can check out the final prototype <a href=\"https://marvelapp.com/24ghdjc\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2><b>Validation</b></h2>\n<p><img class=\"text-center aligncenter wp-image-430072\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Carousell-redesign-24.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"656\" height=\"408\"></p>\n<h2><b>Key takeaways</b></h2>\n<p>Carousell\u2019s mission is to monetize consumer assets that are lying stagnant in our homes, fuel a secondhand economy, and help reduce global consumer waste.

(Just kidding. Or am I?)</p>\n<p>With all the hype around Circles.Life and their viral marketing campaigns, I sat down with Delbert Ty, brand and marketing leader, and Megan Yulga, marketing manager at Circles.Life, to find out just how they plan to make that happen.</p>\n<h2>Circles.Life</h2>\n<p>Circles.Life is Singapore\u2019s fourth telco and the first digital telco to <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/circles-life-new-singapore-telco\" rel=\"nofollow\">break into the local telco market in May 2016</a>.</p>\n<p>A year on, it <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/circles-life-digital-telco-expansion\" rel=\"nofollow\">claims to be on track</a> to capture four to six percent of Singapore\u2019s mobile postpaid market in the next few years.

According to our research, it was very clear that in Singapore, people are data deprived. And as former customers of other telcos, we know that this problem is real, and it can be addressed. So how best do we address it?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is where the product comes in, such as our 20GB for S$20 Data Plus option,\u201d he said. \u201cWe measure all of our products against how well they address these problems. Once we settle on a solution, we think about how we can get people to be aware of the problem and the solution. That\u2019s where we move from strategy to execution.\u201d</p>\n<p>The team then goes through multiple rounds of planned and impromptu brainstorming, after which a campaign idea is locked into their product and marketing calendar. They then brief their agency to develop a creative angle which they will execute together through a hybrid production model of agency and in-house creatives.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis enables us to work in a fast and cost-efficient manner,\u201d said Ty.</p>\n<h3>Marketing and the power of storytelling</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_429782\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-429782\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Circleslife1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: Sim Yanting</p>\n</div>\n<p>\u201cWhat our team does is to take the the company\u2019s mission and create a story around it,\u201d said Yulga. \u201cAnd for people to buy into it and feel that it\u2019s personal and that they\u2019re a part of it as well.\u201d</p>\n<p>As such, every campaign the team runs has implicit elements of storytelling.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe start with a headline,\u201d said Ty. \u201cHow will this get picked up? What is the one sentence we want people to take away? Then we think of the story in many different ways, much like writers do. In each story we tell, there is an exposition, a climax, and a conclusion. You\u2019ll see it in all our campaigns.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yulga concurs.</p>\n<p>\u201cIf you pay attention,\u201d she said, \u201cyou\u2019ll notice how the elements in our campaigns are all connected, but we do it such that you can only see one chapter at any one time, and you\u2019ll still get the message without seeing the other chapters. But if you see everything laid out in front of you, you\u2019ll go, oh, I see what you did there.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yulga gives the example of Circles.Life\u2019s data deprivation campaign.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn this campaign, we started off with \u2018What\u2019s the issue?\u2019 \u2014 data deprivation,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is chapter one.\u201d</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_429807\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-429807\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/data-deprivation-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1656\" height=\"630\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: Circles.Life</p>\n</div>\n<p>\u201cThen we looked into \u2018How do you know that\u2019s an issue?\u2019.

This is where we introduced the Hotspot Hound, the Data Leech, and the Wifi Caged that many consumers can probably identify with,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is chapter two.\u201d</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_429808\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-429808\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/hotspot-hound.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1656\" height=\"630\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: Circles.Life.</p>\n</div>\n<p>\u201cChapter three is the solution, and that\u2019s something you can look forward to,\u201d Yulga said. \u201cThis is how we bring people to conceive of the problem, identify with it, and come around to Circles.Life as the solution.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ty believes that good storytelling is necessary to cut through the noise in this hyper attention-deficit day and age. \u201cIf you say the same thing over and over again, your messages are going to get stale really fast,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we keep it fresh, keep it moving, all while reinforcing the same message.\u201d</p>\n<h3>Marketing channels</h3>\n<p>Yulga believes that one of the greatest strengths of the team is that they use digital marketing tools well.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe have a Facebook-first approach,\u201d she said. \u201cWe try to be relevant, personal and specific with our marketing. For example, if we know someone is nearing the end of their contract with another telco, we will give them specific actions to take to make their transition to Circles.Life as seamless as possible.\u201d</p>\n<p>Other marketing channels the team uses include out-of-home (OOH) advertising, Google AdWords, YouTube, and Criteo for retargeting.</p>\n<p>Facebook remains the most versatile channel for them, since its users greatly overlap with their target audience.</p>\n<h3>Success metrics</h3>\n<p>\u201cWhenever possible, we primarily use Google Analytics to track key performance metrics like website visits, email registrations, and most importantly, transactions,\u201d said Ty. \u201cOn top of this, we track how these results compare to the ad spend, giving us clear perspective on cost per acquisition, and from there, determine if any tactical pivots are required.\u201d</p>\n<p>Things get a little trickier with OOH advertising, where they take a leap of faith and rely on their understanding of the customer.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t expect to have the same amount of analytical rigour with OOH,\u201d he said. \u201cBut once every two months, we do a brand survey to track sources of awareness. This gives us some sort of idea of the performance of a specific campaign.\u201d</p>\n<p>Yulga added that the success of OOH campaigns can at times be attributed to traffic spikes to their platform during the campaign.</p>\n<h2>Case study: The 20GB for S$20 campaign</h2>\n<p>The 20GB for S$20 campaign is an option that allows consumers to add on 20GB of data for S$20 on top of their base plans.\u00a0Ty describes the <a href=\"https://pages.circles.life/campaign-20plus/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">now-infamous campaign</a> as \u201cgame-changing\u201d. But it did not start out that way.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe idea came up during one of our brainstorming sessions with Rameez (co-founder and CEO of Circles.Life.),\u201d said Ty. \u201cAt that point of time, very few people knew about Circles.Life, and I saw that what we needed to tackle was awareness. My initial struggle with the 20GB for S$20 campaign was that it was purely product play, which did not fit the issue we needed to tackle at hand.\u201d</p>\n<p>This struggle for him became precisely what made the campaign such a success.</p>\n<p>\u201cI started to reframe how I looked at the campaign,\u201d he continued. \u201cInstead of looking at it merely as a product upgrade, how do we frame the campaign as something so insane that it will get eyeballs, therefore giving us the right kind of awareness we\u2019re looking for?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cSo we went all out. I told the team, \u2018Let\u2019s make all our advertising content about 20GB for S$20, let\u2019s make this really outrageous.\u2019 We launched it with <a href=\"https://vulcanpost.com/604857/circleslife-publicity-stunt-year-youtiao666/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">a guerrilla campaign</a> with social media influencers\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/youtiao666/?hl=en\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Youtiao666</a>. Everything in our campaign was designed to make people shut up, sit up and listen to what we were saying. Then you get the awareness.\u201d</p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-429962 aligncenter\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-25-at-12.47.17-pm.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"933\" height=\"464\"></p>\n<p>\u201cIf it were just about a product upgrade, everyone who joined Circles.Life from that point onwards would get the 20GB for S$20 add-on. But that\u2019s not the case. We got a lot of people who were just happy with the base plan. And they would not have joined Circles.Life if not for the awareness created by the campaign,\u201d he said.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe whole campaign was overwhelming in a good way,\u201d Yulga added, \u201cIt was obviously something we planned for, but not at the level we got. It has challenged us to not only strengthen our operations, billing, and delivery; it\u2019s put our product development in a spotlight moving forward.\u201d</p>\n<h2>On flak</h2>\n<p>That said, their ad campaigns have had their fair share of flak.</p>\n<p>For example, netizens have <a href=\"http://www.marketing-interactive.com/circles-life-responds-to-controversy-over-hungry-for-more-data-ads/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">criticised</a> the data deprivation campaign as \u201cdistasteful\u201d and \u201cinsensitive and dismissive of a real global problem.\u201d</p>\n<p>In spite of the criticisms, Yulga believes that the campaigns have served their purpose in bringing awareness to the fact that Singapore has been deprived in mobile data offerings.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat was really interesting were the conversations happening around it,\u201d said Yulga. \u201cOur objective was to create conversation, and we\u2019ve 100 percent achieved it. Conversation was had, and it was had around data.\u201d</p>\n<h2>On growth hacking</h2>\n<p>As the new kid on the block, but already the talk of the town, surely there must be some growth hacking going on?</p>\n<p>\u201cNot really,\u201d laughed Ty. \u201cWe just do what we think makes sense.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cI would say that our referral program is our best growth hack,\u201d said Yulga. \u201cWhen you refer a friend with your referral code and he or she joins Circles.Life, you\u2019re rewarded with data. We have people with over 150GB of data. That\u2019s over 600 people they referred! Over 40 percent of our transactions happen because of referrals.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOther very established players have asked how we\u2019ve made this referral system work for us,\u201d Ty added. \u201cYou\u2019ll be surprised at the names that\u2019ve come knocking.\u201d</p>\n<h2>Advice to fledgling startups with massive incumbents</h2>\n<p>\u201cPlay to your strengths, and their weaknesses,\u201d said Ty. \u201cKnow what you can do and what they can\u2019t. Act with speed. Dare to vandalize an MRT ad to make a point. Have fun and don\u2019t take yourselves too seriously.</p>\n<p>There will always be those who don\u2019t agree with what you are doing and will drag you down. Don\u2019t be a slave to consensus, only to your mission. Ours is giving power back to the customer by innovating the telco industry. We keep this mission in everything we do and it comes through.\u201d</p>", "spider_name": "techinasia", "id": "techinasia_429602", "has_funding_news": 0.21261008083820343}

Denali in Alaska, 2004.</p>\n</div>\n<p id=\"583c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">I follow the general premise that life is part purpose-driven planning and part serendipity. We always have control over our deliberate planning and execution, but we also need to be ready to pursue serendipitous opportunities even though we\u2019re not in control of them when they arrive. I\u2019ve written about this as part of\u00a0<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"http://www.kixx.name/blogs/kris_walker/life_strategy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"http://www.kixx.name/blogs/kris_walker/life_strategy\">my life strategy</a>\u00a0before.</p>\n<p id=\"bb92\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">One of those serendipitous moments came last year when I was asked to take the helm of\u00a0<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://oddnetworks.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"https://oddnetworks.com/\">Odd Networks</a>, a startup I had helped found barely a year earlier. We created a software platform for managing and delivering video content to streaming devices like mobile phones, tablets, smart TVs, Roku, and Apple TV.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">When I took the lead as CEO, the plan was to get a couple of big partner deals to fund the company in the short term (which we did) then raise money for higher growth (which we did\u00a0<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">not</em>\u00a0do). Along the way, we took on a convertible debt note (a complicated financial fundraising instrument) and even acquired another startup.</p>\n<h2><strong>A second look</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"2561\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Up until this April, I had been working 60 to 70 hours a week and traveling about once a month to make Odd Networks into the growth company we wanted it to be. Last summer, my wife and I made a pact that I would put everything I had into the company until April. If I didn\u2019t have a deadline, the workaholic behavior could have gone on forever. It was fortunate that we did because when April came around, my mind and body were at the end of the proverbial rope.</p>\n<p id=\"d066\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">After slowing down that month, and by pure coincidence, my co-founders and I began to take a second look at the strategic direction of the company. With time running out to raise venture capital, we had to make some dramatic changes on how we defined success.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In the end, the venture investors we were talking to were right. The space we targeted in the video industry was not primed for the kind of growth that would yield returns. And besides, did we really want to adopt the lifestyle of running a growth company?</p>\n<p id=\"d29d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">If we decided to sell the company instead, it would have to be done within the next 12 months or we would run out of money without venture funding. It would have been a lot of work and dedication, but the payout might be worth it\u2014in theory.</p>\n<p>In <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"http://paulgraham.com/wealth.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"http://paulgraham.com/wealth.html\">an essay</a>\u00a0(you really should read it),\u00a0Paul Graham explained\u00a0this idea of working hard to sell a company as compressing decades of your career into a few short years. According to him, we should be prepared for the workload of that compression. And therein lies the catch.</p>\n<h2><strong>What I couldn\u2019t do as CEO</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"45f4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This is where purpose-driven planning comes into play. Investing all our effort into Odd Networks and selling it carries a risk that began to outweigh the work required for a successful outcome. We also wanted to be able to continue to grow the team under a new parent company here in Saratoga, New York if we were acquired. And this put an extra risk vector on the whole thing. It\u2019s a classic ROI calculation, and the ratio was not working out in favor of selling the company.</p>\n<p id=\"1fe2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">At the prompting of my co-founders, this got me thinking, <em>what would make\u00a0me\u00a0happy</em>? What do I want my life to look like in six months? 12 months? 18 months? I think we all need to do this more often. It\u2019s easy to get heads down in our daily work and lose sight of where we\u2019re trying to go.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">It\u2019s easy to get heads down in our daily work and lose sight of where we\u2019re trying to go.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"8026\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I decided I wanted Odd Networks to be a part of my future, but\u00a0<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">not to consume</em>\u00a0it. I want to be at the center of my kids\u2019 lives (who are five and eight years old). I want to travel with my family. I want to help others learn software programming. I want to get more seriously involved in the political causes I believe in. I want to run for the school board. I want to get fit and climb big mountains again. I\u2019ve done really well trading options on the stock market in the last five years and I should do more of that. I\u2019d like to do some real estate investment too.</p>\n<p id=\"e279\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I can do all those things, come to work, and do a great job as a software developer at Odd Networks. But I can\u2019t do that as CEO. And frankly, I would do a bad job at all of them if I tried. In fact, I was trying to do some of them simultaneously and was already failing. I realized that at this point in my life, with this company, I couldn\u2019t separate the CEO role from the software developer mindset and my desire to be involved in things I want to work on.</p>\n<h2><strong>A tapestry of many things</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"cbc4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I still believe it is possible to be an entrepreneur and remain president or CEO of the company you helped found while maintaining a healthy life outside of that work. Being the leader of a company certainly means making some sacrifices. But I would also encourage entrepreneurs to be disciplined about it and understand the purpose of the company your are building and the trade-offs.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Want a high-growth startup? Make sure you\u2019re ready to give up a significant portion of your life in pursuit of the exit. Selling your company for profit? It\u2019s going to be a lot of work and stress for a payout that may not work out for you. Growing your business for sustainability? Make sure to stay true to your vision and understand that you are building a business. Otherwise, it will just turn into the worst job you ever had.

We should think of it more like a tapestry of many things which we weave around while embracing imperfections.</p>\n<p id=\"3738\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">When I looked at the life I wanted to live and the things I wanted to do, being CEO of Odd Networks will be a blocker rather than an opportunity. But with a little time thinking about it, the solution was right in front of me. I\u2019m going to continue to be a partner in the company, while\u00a0<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://twitter.com/UpstateVC\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"https://twitter.com/UpstateVC\">Mitchell Patterson</a>, another partner, will take the helm as president and CEO. I\u2019m going remain onboard as the best software developer I can be in support of his leadership.</p>\n<p id=\"e19c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">We\u2019re going to keep our company and build it into one of the most well-known software platforms for the future of television. We\u2019re going to do it our way, one customer and one project at a time. We\u2019re going to keep the company here where we live. And if we stay true to our vision, it will slowly grow, just like in the old days before startups were a thing. Patience is a virtue worth having.</p>\n<p id=\"a4ff\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Our skill sets are more inline with our new positions, and the opportunities we now have are more inline with our personal ambitions. I\u2019ll be happier, and our team will be more confident in our future as a company.</p>\n<p id=\"2631\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Life is about purpose-driven planning and serendipitous opportunities.

As of now, though, customer retention data looks pretty grim.</p>\n<p>According to\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.appcues.com/blog/3-cringeworthy-stats-on-customer-retention/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">this article</a>, 86 percent of new mobile users never return after the\u00a0initial download, while a mere 2.7 percent stick around after 30 days. But customer retention is important. After all, increasing the rate by 5 percent\u00a0<a href=\"http://hbswk.hbs.edu/archive/1590.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">increases profits by 25 to 95 percent</a>.</p>\n<p>So, how do you go about fixing your customer retention rate? In order to get a firsthand understanding of the topic, I turned to some of my favorite apps to figure out what led me back to them day after day. A lot of these companies were kind enough to share their customer retention strategies with me, while I learned about the others\u2019 through their blogs and interviews.</p>\n<h2>Customer journey</h2>\n<p>Each customer goes through three stages: new, occasional, and power user. Your ultimate goal is to convert every new user into a power user, and your retention strategy should cover each of these stages.</p>\n<p>But first, you need to define what it means to be a power user of your product. In other words, what are the key retention metrics for your product? Once you define these, it\u2019s time to track and work on improving them. Here\u2019s how you can improve your customer retention rate like a pro.</p>\n<h2>New users</h2>\n<p>The onboarding experience is the most important step in a user\u2019s journey. Get this right and you\u2019ve got a lot less to worry about later!</p>\n<p>But what does it mean to onboard a customer successfully? Behance founder Scott Belsky <a href=\"https://medium.com/positiveslope/crafting-the-first-mile-of-product-7ed25e8f1027\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">suggests</a> that successful businesses are built when a\u00a0majority of their new users reach \u201cThe Zone\u201d or the point where they know three things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Why they\u2019re there</li>\n<li>What they can accomplish</li>\n<li>What to do next</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Here\u2019s what to keep in mind when designing your onboarding flow:</p>\n<h3><strong>Show users the value of your product first</strong></h3>\n<p>Most startups are too concerned about getting their hands on users\u2019 details first. But language learning app <a href=\"https://www.duolingo.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Duloingo</a> does it differently. When you head over to the app, you\u2019re asked which language you\u2019d like to learn\u2014no signup page or lengthy forms. Next, you set a daily goal and take a test to gauge your familiarity with the language. Meanwhile, the signup button lingers somewhere in the background. Before you know it, you\u2019re engrossed in the test and have signed up to save your progress.</p>\n<p>Duolingo VP of growth Gina Gotthilf <a href=\"http://firstround.com/review/the-tenets-of-a-b-testing-from-duolingos-master-growth-hacker/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">says</a> this approach was a result of extensive testing.\u00a0Initially, a lot of people who downloaded the app were not signing up. This meant the team couldn\u2019t send them notifications or emails. How did they fix this? They let users play around with Duolingo first.</p>\n<p>They also changed the design of the page, replacing the discouraging \u201cDiscard my progress\u201d button with a more subtle \u201cLater\u201d option.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_429987\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter text-center\">\n<img class=\"text-center wp-image-429987\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Image-25-09-2017-at-2.04-PM.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"545\" height=\"438\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Screenshots from the Duolingo app. Photo credit: Duolingo.</p>\n</div>\n<p>The app now has three optional signup pages or \u201csoft walls\u201d as Gotthilf calls them. These are followed by a hard wall that needs users to sign up if they wish to move forward. All these changes combined have led to an 8.2 percent increase in the app\u2019s DAUs.</p>\n<p><strong>Takeaway</strong>: While most startups scramble to get users to sign up first, show users the product\u2019s value instead. This means getting them to experience the key features of your product as soon as possible. Identify the point in your user\u2019s journey when they\u2019ve derived some value out of your product. Introduce a few optional signup pages before this point and measure the results.</p>\n<h3><strong>Make signing up a piece of cake</strong></h3>\n<p>Sooner or later, you\u2019ll introduce a signup page. When you do, make sure it\u2019s worth your customers\u2019 time.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://in.pinterest.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Pinterest</a>\u2019s signup process is a good example, as it involves just three steps.</p>\n<p>Former Pinterest growth lead Casey Winters <a href=\"http://caseyaccidental.com/startup-onboarding\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">shares</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThe first principle we learned at Pinterest is that we should get people to the core product as fast as possible, but not faster. What that means is that you should only ask the user for the minimum amount of information you need to get them to the valuable experience.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>When you sign up on Pinterest, you\u2019re asked for your full name, email, age, gender, and five topics you\u2019d like to follow. Immediately, you\u2019re shown a screen full of \u201cpins\u201d you might be interested in.</p>\n<p><strong>Takeaway</strong>: When designing your signup form, think of how each field is relevant for you to offer a valuable customer experience. You might think \u201cLast name\u201d is just one additional field, but your customer might already be distracted at that point.</p>\n<h3>\n<strong>Show </strong><strong>and </strong><strong>tell when teaching users how to use your product </strong>\n</h3>\n<p>When onboarding customers, it\u2019s important to both show <em>and</em> guide users along the way, so they get a thorough understanding of your product.</p>\n<p>The \u201cWelcome Board\u201d on <a href=\"https://trello.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Trello</a>, for example, does a great job of telling customers how to use the product while also showing them the product\u2019s features. It covers everything from the basics, such as attaching files to a card, to more advanced features, such as adding teams.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-429985\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Image-25-09-2017-at-2.04-PM-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1023\" height=\"452\"></p>\n<p>Michael Pryor, the head of Trello, shared with me that only showing and not telling can be \u201cintimidating\u201d for some users. The result of this approach is that even though Trello is packed with features, new users can learn how to use them at a glance.</p>\n<p><strong>Takeaway</strong>: Don\u2019t be afraid to tell your users what they should do with your product. The key is to know how much is too much. Don\u2019t bombard users with extensive tutorials or videos as soon as they fire up the product, but make it easy for them to access information at any point.</p>\n<h3><strong>Use contextual cues to educate new users</strong></h3>\n<p>Many startups make the mistake of throwing too much information at their users and overwhelming them. A better way to educate customers about your product is through contextual cues. This means telling users what to do next when they reach a specific point of action, rather than when they launch the app for the first time.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://slack.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Slack</a>\u2018s Slackbot is an excellent example of educating customers <em>while </em>they use the product. As soon as you launch the app, Slackbot sends you a welcome message, prompting you to type your first message. Next, it gives you a quick tour of Slack\u2019s channels, direct messages, and invites. After this, you\u2019re free to ask Slackbot any questions regarding the app\u2019s features as and when you get to them.</p>\n<p><strong>Takeaway</strong>: Don\u2019t be in rush to explain every single feature to new users with long-winded tours. Only give them the bare minimum information they need to start using your app.</p>\n<h2>Occasional users</h2>\n<p>These are users that have experienced the key features of your product but are yet to use it regularly. They may be stuck at this stage, and will most likely leave if you don\u2019t engage them enough.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how you can push occasional users into becoming your best advocates:</p>\n<h3><strong>Show them how much progress they\u2019ve made </strong></h3>\n<p>Showing users how much they\u2019ve accomplished with your product encourages them to come back. This is also the type of notification they\u2019re more likely to respond to.</p>\n<p>For Duolingo, it\u2019s key that users return and practice every day. But as anyone who has ever signed up for an MOOC knows, this is easier said than done. To make users come back to the app, the team introduced the concept of streaks, which involves keeping track of how many days in a row the user\u00a0has used the product.</p>\n<p>Social media scheduling app <a href=\"https://buffer.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Buffer</a> also has their own approach. According to the company\u2019s growth product manager, Maxime Berthelot, the app uses two major ways to bring back users: emailing users when their queue becomes empty and emailing them with their latest post analytics. The first nudges them to come back to fill their queue while the second encourages them to schedule more posts.</p>\n<p><strong>Takeaway</strong>: While progress emails are an obvious choice for Buffer, Duolingo has especially introduced the concept of goals to keep users engaged. No matter what your product is, track and share users\u2019 progress with them to keep them coming back.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re a B2B app, you likely have a ton of information and data to share with users about their performance. Instead of waiting for them to get to their dashboard, you can email it to them.</p>\n<h3><strong>Send win-back notifications and emails at the right time</strong></h3>\n<p>How do you time your notifications? What do your notifications say? If your notifications turn up on users\u2019 screens when they\u2019re about to sleep and entice them with random offers, you\u2019re doing it wrong. Win-back notifications work when they\u2019re sent at the optimal time with an optimal message. Otherwise, they\u2019re spam.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s take Duolingo as an example again. The team tested both notification content and time to see which suited their users best. The team assumed that whenever someone used their app on a particular day, it was a good time for that user to use the app the next day too. Thus, they now send notifications to users 23.5 hours after they use the app.</p>\n<p>With content, they tried making their copy funny and even put a quiz in the notification itself. Ultimately, the winner was a notification that said, \u201cHi, it\u2019s Duo.\u201d (Duo being their owl mascot.)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.intercom.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Intercom</a>, a customer messaging platform for businesses, also does this well. In order to ensure that their notifications were not falling on deaf ears, they prioritized the most appropriate customers to hear about what they had to say.</p>\n<p>Intercom manager of product education Ruairi Galavan told me more about this approach:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cIf we know certain customers have visited the campaign page three times but have not created a campaign yet, we might push some content to them to encourage them to get started with campaigns. We follow the pattern of \u201chas done x, has not done y\u201d all the time. These are the people who\u2019ve shown some level of commitment but have yet to activate.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>This approach lets them send relevant and targeted notifications to customers who may find them helpful, and stay out of the way of people who don\u2019t need them.</p>\n<p><strong>Takeaway</strong>: Figure out how often you need customers to use your product. Once you have that in place, test different times and messages for notifications. If you\u2019re trying to build a habit, track the time of day users are using your product most. Another approach is to send notifications based on the actions that users take on your product.</p>\n<p>While reaching out to users, try to have a specific reason for doing so. Also, be sure to test copy by varying the tone to see which one clicks.</p>\n<h3><strong>Harness the power of content </strong></h3>\n<p>Content is generally used to acquire new users, but it can also keep users engaged as well. <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/3063503/how-these-two-companies-hooked-customers-on-products-they-\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">According to <em>Hooked</em> author Nir Eyal</a>, people might not buy financial products, houses, cars, or seasonal products every day, but they could make a habit of visiting your website if you publish valuable content.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zapier.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Zapier</a>, a platform that integrates and connects different apps, has a great blog, for example. It provides helpful app tips and tricks, productivity hacks, and ways to get\u00a0more out of your work life.</p>\n<p>You can also use content to show existing customers features they didn\u2019t know about and show prospects how powerful the tool is. Email platform Vero does this well. <a href=\"http://www.jimmydaly.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Jimmy Daly</a>, the\u00a0former content marketer at Vero, says:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cWhen I worked at Vero, we created content that mirrored our help documents, but we presented it in a way that was interesting to anyone thinking about behavioral email. Content also works really well in retention emails. We could send idle users ideas for campaigns, better subject lines, etc.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Takeaway</strong>: When thinking of your content strategy, don\u2019t limit yourself to capturing new users. Think of content that benefits existing customers as well. The idea is to keep users engaged even if they aren\u2019t using your product every day. Your content should also solve a problem for the customer and not just tell them about your product\u2019s features.</p>\n<h3><strong>Offer stellar customer service </strong></h3>\n<p>Great customer service can truly take you places. A\u00a0<a href=\"http://about.americanexpress.com/news/docs/2011x/axp_2011_csbar_market.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">survey by American Express</a> found that 70 percent of Americans were willing to spend an average of 13 percent more with companies that offer excellent customer service.</p>\n<p>For online helpdesk software <a href=\"https://www.groovehq.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Groove</a>, customer service is integral to its customer retention strategy. Groove head of marketing Len Markidan tells me why this is so important:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cWhen you get back to an angry customer within 10 minutes with a personal, non-canned response, it can quickly diffuse the situation. While they\u2019re not happy with something, <em>making </em>them happy is important enough to you that you\u2019ll drop everything to help.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Takeaway</strong>: If you want customers to stick around longer, make customer service a priority. Even if your product isn\u2019t the\u00a0first choice for users, great customer service can make it so. Respond to requests and complaints as quickly as you can and try to be as helpful as possible. Every angry/disappointed email is an opportunity to show customers that you do in fact care about them.</p>\n<h3><strong>Monitor user activity closely</strong></h3>\n<p>Remember, you can\u2019t change what you don\u2019t measure. Thus, it\u2019s important to observe users when they use your product to figure out your stickiest features and the metrics you need to watch.</p>\n<p>For example, Intercom tracks two core usage metrics: activation and engagement. Activation is the point at which a customer first realizes the value of the product. The company measures this by looking at the first time a customer takes a specific action, such as sending an auto-message. A successfully activated customer typically meets a specific threshold of activity, such as sending x number of auto-messages.</p>\n<p>Intercom senior manager of product analytics Karen Church shares that tracking the percentage of new customers that activate is important. According to her, \u201cWe know that customers who successfully activate are more likely to go on to become fully engaged and happy customers who retain with us for the long term.\u201d</p>\n<p>As it turns out, customers who activate have approximately a 23 percent higher retention rate than customers that don\u2019t.</p>\n<p><strong>Takeaway</strong>: If you want to replicate the success of power users, you need to observe what actions they take, features they use most, and their level of activity. Use analytics tools such as Amplitude and Segment to monitor customer behavior at various touchpoints. Once you have this data, you\u2019ll know what messages to use to reach out to occasional users and which actions and features to direct them to.</p>\n<h3><strong>Identify what causes customers to leave</strong></h3>\n<p>Some of your users are bound to leave. But there are lessons you can learn.</p>\n<p>Take a look at Groove\u2019s system for dealing with churn. Markidan\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.groovehq.com/support/reduce-churn-with-successful-user-onboarding\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">shares</a>\u00a0that they first identify the red flags that cause customers to leave using their own usage metrics and by talking to users who leave. For instance, one of these red flags is the length of time needed to set up Twitter integration.</p>\n<p>In order to tackle this, they set up a new system. Whenever a user spends too long on a certain task in multiple sessions, they send him a message like this:</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-429986\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Image-25-09-2017-at-2.04-PM-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"690\" height=\"300\"></p>\n<p>The email has yielded a 10 percent response rate and resulted in a 30 percent retention rate after 30 days.</p>\n<p><strong>Takeaway</strong>: If you want to improve retention, figure out why users leave in the first place. You can use analytics tools to gather this data or try setting up phone calls with customers that churn. If you notice a certain feature being brought up too many times, take that as a red flag.</p>\n<h2>Power users</h2>\n<p>Power users are proof that you\u2019re doing something right. While these users give you a reason to cheer, they\u2019re also the ones you need to observe carefully. Why do they choose your product over others? How can you capitalize on this information? It\u2019s important to keep these users happy and engaged if you want them to become your biggest cheerleaders.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how you can develop a better relationship with power users:</p>\n<h3><strong>Take feedback from them</strong></h3>\n<p>Power users are your best source of feedback. They\u2019re in a position to tell you what worked for them and where you can improve.</p>\n<p>Buffer knows this, which is why Berthelot said they often email their power users to help them test new ideas.</p>\n<p>But when doing feedback sessions, it\u2019s important to ask the right questions if you want helpful answers. Daly suggests the following strategy:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cWhen a customer does something awesome in your product, find out how they did it. Who played key roles? What was discussed in the meetings leading up to it? Were there any points where they nearly gave up?\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to him, there\u2019s a minor difference between power users and those who almost give up. It is essential for companies to find these inflection points to inform their product and messaging strategies.</p>\n<p><strong>Takeaway</strong>: Feedback is critical to your startup\u2019s success and more so\u00a0if it\u2019s coming from a power user. There are different ways to collect feedback, such as surveys and emails. The best way to get customer feedback, however, could be picking up the phone and talking to customers directly.</p>\n<p>When seeking feedback, focus on the key aspects that you can capitalize on when you message other users. Take note of the language power users use and incorporate it into your marketing so it appeals to new and occasional users.</p>\n<h3><strong>Engage them on social media </strong></h3>\n<p>Interacting with power users can be a valuable addition to your social media strategy. More often than not, users express their displeasure or love for a product on these platforms.</p>\n<p>For example, Buffer has a community Slack channel and conducts regular Twitter chats, which their product managers often attend.</p>\n<p>Another company that engages power users on Twitter is Slack. They collect feedback on the platform (called #beeftweets). These are often small things that the team can fix quickly.</p>\n<p><strong>Takeaway</strong>: Find out where your users hang out, make sure you\u2019re present where your users are, and engage them in conversations on these platforms. Users are more likely to respond to your questions on social media, where they spend a lot of time anyway, rather than fill out a survey. But make sure not to bombard users with product talk alone, though. Think of creative ways to engage them in conversations.</p>\n<h3>Incentivize with additional features</h3>\n<p>In order to show customers how much you care about them, it might be good to offer them something, like an additional function in your product.</p>\n<p>Trello does this with the use of power-ups, which allow you to \u201cbuild apps and added functionality on top of Trello.\u201d</p>\n<p>For instance, with the Twitter power-up, I can attach a Twitter conversation to any card and get updates on it. The calendar power-up, on the other hand, allows me to see a time-based overview of cards with all their due dates. The more you use the platform, the more power-ups you get.</p>\n<p><strong>Takeaway</strong>: Reward your power users with added features and functionalities. If you\u2019re unsure how you can add additional value to your product for power users, simply ask.</p>\n<p>Another strategy you can use is to invite power users to your beta programs for new features and take their feedback into consideration to make them feel like a part of your product\u2019s journey.</p>\n<h2>Wrapping up</h2>\n<p>While you\u2019re scrambling to get new users, make sure they\u2019re not slipping away when you\u2019re busy drafting PPC campaigns. Constantly optimize your onboarding process to delight new users and get them to experience your product\u2019s key features. After they get there, show them the value they\u2019re receiving out of your product, send them valuable content, and observe their activity closely. Once they become power users, learn how you can replicate their success with feedback calls, social media, and additional features.</p>", "spider_name": "techinasia", "id": "techinasia_429412", "has_funding_news": 0.2996166944503784}

By that time, I think we\u2019ll have people living and working on Mars and the Moon, and satellites will play a large role in communication between the Earth and those bases,\u201d she adds.</p>\n<p>The first-time entrepreneur is a graduate of France\u2019s International Space University, which only takes in around 200 students each year.</p>\n<p>\u201cAt that time, I was a masters student in Japan, and ISU gave me the chance to talk and discuss space with people from all over the world,\u201d explains Kurahara.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_429550\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-429550\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nasa-satellite.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1500\" height=\"998\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: NASA / Unsplash.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Seeing how satellites were about to become even more critical, it was there that she got the seeds of the idea for her startup.</p>\n<p>\u201cVery simply, I wanted to make a ground station antenna network service. I didn\u2019t think I would be able to do this in existing private sector businesses or academia, so I decided that creating a startup was the fastest and most effective way of accomplishing my goal,\u201d Kurahara tells <em>Tech in Asia</em>.</p>\n<p>The result is <a href=\"https://www.infostellar.net\" target=\"_blank\">Infostellar</a>, a kinda sorta Airbnb for satellites in which antenna owners rent out spare capacity to satellite operators. And just like Airbnb takes a cut from your stays at someone\u2019s house, Kurahara\u2019s startup pockets a slice of each space hook-up it enables.</p>\n<h2>Beam me down, Scotty</h2>\n<p>By tapping into antenna here on Earth only when needed, the idea is that it lowers costs for businesses that rely on satellite transmissions \u2013 and also lowers barriers for new firms entering the satellite industry.</p>\n<p>\u201cOur main customers are operators of satellite constellations,\u201d she explains. \u201cSome examples of use cases are Earth observation, satellite internet access, S-AIS / ADS-B, M2M IoT networking by small satellite, debris tracking, and government science organization contracts. In other words, anything one would expect from LEO satellite usage.\u201d</p>\n<p>LEO means low Earth orbit, with an altitude of 2,000 kilometers or less. It\u2019s the hotspot for the fast-growing commercial space industry, which includes Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX.</p>\n<p>Those Airbnb\u2019d antenna are used to beam back a variety of data. \u201cEarth observation companies would primarily be receiving images taken by their satellite, whereas S-AIS / ADS-B companies would be receiving location information of ships or airplanes, respectively,\u201d says the CEO.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_429472\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-429472\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Infostellar-team.jpg\" alt=\"Infostellar\" width=\"1378\" height=\"919\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Team with board.

I had 15 people working for me, my business was losing money every month, I was stressed beyond belief, and everyone thought I was successful. \u201cYou know, Jeff,\u201d my business coach told me, \u201cyou don\u2019t have to do this.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"fd1b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">But I did. At least, I thought I did. When you\u2019re good at something, you have to keep doing it even if it\u2019s killing you, right?</p>\n<p id=\"21ef\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">After bootstrapping my company to a million dollars, I was now living in the stressful reality of running a seven-figure company.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">So, I did what smart entrepreneurs do in this situation. I hired a coach.</p>\n<h2 id=\"32e3\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">From a blogger to a CEO</h2>\n<p id=\"edbd\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">I thought things would be easier, but now they were harder than ever. So, I reached out to my friend\u00a0<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"http://caseygraham.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"http://caseygraham.com/\">Casey Graham</a>\u00a0to help me make sense of this.</p>\n<p id=\"052d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Casey coaches business owners on how to scale their companies, helping entrepreneurs become CEOs. Here\u2019s what he told me when I asked to stop feeling so stressed about running a business:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"8a3d\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\"><p>\u201cFirst, you\u2019ll need to work harder than you\u2019ve ever worked before. For the next 24 months, you\u2019re going to have to act more like a CEO and less like a writer. It\u2019s not going to be easy, you\u2019re probably going to hate it, but in the end, you\u2019ll be able to get out of your business and do what you really want.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p id=\"6335\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">This sounded like the advice from a friend who runs a software company: \u201cYour life is going to suck for the next two years, but after that things will be great.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"8ab2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">OK, great,\u00a0I thought.\u00a0I can do that. It\u2019s only two years. If this is what it takes to succeed, this is what must be done.</p>\n<p id=\"029e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Together, Casey and I mapped out a plan that included US$600,000 in new salaries, a bigger team, lots of expenses, more work, and even more stress. And for six months, I worked the plan, pursuing this dream of freedom, updating my coach every week.</p>\n<p id=\"f7dd\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">But each week, my anxiety grew and Casey told me the same thing: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this.\u201d Still, I kept going.</p>\n<p id=\"96bb\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">My love for the work decreased. I stopped writing altogether. As the company grew, expenses increased, and there were even a few months when we lost money. As someone who grew up lower middle class, I worried I was going to bankrupt myself trying to scale this thing.</p>\n<p id=\"62fa\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I was sleeping less, eating more, and not having very much fun. In the back of my mind, I wondered:\u00a0Is this how growth is supposed to feel like?</p>\n<h2 id=\"478f\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\"><strong>A phone call with Seth Godin changed everything</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"d5ae\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">I shared my concerns with Casey and, once again, he said, \u201cJeff, you don\u2019t have to do this. Why don\u2019t you take the next few days to decide what you\u00a0<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">really\u00a0</em>want?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"713a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I contacted a few friends and mentors, people I\u2019d admired for years and respected how they had grown their own businesses. One person was\u00a0<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"http://sethgodin.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"http://sethgodin.com/\">Seth Godin</a>, a best-selling author and successful entrepreneur. He was someone who represented my equal interests in art and business.</p>\n<p id=\"3bd2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Within an hour, Seth responded to my short email with an even shorter reply: \u201cCall me.\u201d And in the email was his cell phone number.</p>\n<p id=\"c708\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Over the course of a 20-minute phone call, Seth blew my mind. He asked about the business\u200a\u2014\u200awhy I started it, how it was structured, and what my goals were.</p>\n<p id=\"f709\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\">\u201cI want to spread ideas that change culture,\u201d I said, eagerly.</p>\n<p id=\"19d4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\">\u201cThat\u2019s your mission,\u201d he corrected, \u201cnot a business goal. Don\u2019t expect to always get paid for your mission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"d4e0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\">\u201cOh,\u201d I said. \u201cWell, we sell online\u00a0courses\u00a0that help writers get paid and published.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"9f0b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\">\u201cGood,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, that\u2019s a business. Why did you start it?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"77d2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\">\u201cBecause, I guess, I wanted freedom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"3dd6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Then, he said something I won\u2019t ever forget:\u00a0<span class=\"markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other\" data-creator-ids=\"anon\">\u201c</span><span class=\"markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other\" data-creator-ids=\"anon f8bbe85fd3bc\">Don\u2019t build a business because you want freedom.\u00a0</span><span class=\"markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other\" data-creator-ids=\"anon f8bbe85fd3bc b176436e91b1\">Build a business because you want to run a business.</span><span class=\"markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other\" data-creator-ids=\"anon f8bbe85fd3bc\">\u201d</span></p>\n<p id=\"6f03\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Seth laid out two options for me:</p>\n<ol class=\"postList\">\n<li id=\"3d41\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">Scale my business, graduate to CEO, and acquire other businesses to help deal with the churn of my industry, eventually creating an eight- or nine-figure company and selling it.</li>\n<li id=\"cb6d\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Keep the business at the same size and focus on profitability instead of growth, saving at least half the money I make every year. Then, with that free time and energy, focus on my craft.</li>\n</ol>\n<p id=\"ebdd\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--li\">\u201cThere will be times,\u201d he said of the second option, \u201cwhen you will get paid what you\u2019re worth. And there will be times when you won\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"1885\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\">\u201cWhat happens when I\u2019m not paid what I\u2019m worth?\u201d I asked, worried.</p>\n<p id=\"b5e6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\">\u201cThat\u2019s why you put half your money in the bank.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"f397\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\">\u201cOh.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"9339\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">We concluded the phone call with me telling Seth I would consider both options. But in my mind, the decision had already been made.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a71c\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\"><strong>How I strategically scaled\u00a0back</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"a7a3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">The next day, I was making breakfast for my kids, flipping pancakes in our kitchen, and thinking about my schedule for the day. I didn\u2019t have any commitments until 11:30 am. It was 8:30 am.</p>\n<p id=\"2e7a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I looked at my daughter and my son who were six months and four years old, respectively. I thought about spending the next two years of their lives trying to scale a business, which felt like a precious time to spend on something I didn\u2019t intend to do for the rest of my life.</p>\n<p id=\"b207\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I don\u2019t want to run a business, I thought.</p>\n<p id=\"bd64\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The next day, I started making decisions that over the past six months have changed everything.</p>\n<p id=\"f5c6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">First, I\u00a0<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">right-sized my business</strong>. I decided to stop growing. Bigger wasn\u2019t better. Smaller was better. More manageable was better.\u00a0<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Better</em>\u00a0was better. This meant making tough decisions\u200a\u2014\u200aletting go of key team members, canceling contracts with talented people, cutting unnecessary expenses, basically doing the exact opposite of what you\u2019re told you need to do to \u201cscale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"9413\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Then, I\u00a0<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">focused on what only I could do</strong>\u2014my\u00a0\u201chighest best,\u201d as my\u00a0<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"http://sethbarnes.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"http://sethbarnes.com/\">old boss</a>\u00a0used to call it. For me, that\u2019s writing. I knew I was in a bad place when I had outsourced everything I enjoyed doing and adopted a new set of responsibilities that I didn\u2019t.</p>\n<p id=\"f633\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Finally, I\u00a0<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">decided to stay in my lane</strong>. I changed the game I was playing\u200a\u2014\u200ahow I was keeping score, what \u201cwinning\u201d was, and so many other things.</p>\n<p id=\"bc01\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">And guess what?</p>\n<p id=\"b5ff\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I felt a lot happier. I had more time to write, more freedom, and was generally a nicer person. I kept a small but lean team of three full-time employees plus myself. We all wear a few different hats, and it\u2019s not always easy, but it works.</p>\n<p id=\"60dc\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Our top line hasn\u2019t grown much, but the bottom line has soared. We\u2019ve basically tripled our profits. We had a 70 percent profit margin the other month. Crazy.</p>\n<p id=\"12aa\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">More important than that is this feels right. This feels like me, not like trying to be other people and horribly failing at it.</p>\n<p id=\"f92b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">It\u2019s like that May Sarton poem where she says, \u201c<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://allpoetry.com/Now-I-Become-Myself\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"https://allpoetry.com/Now-I-Become-Myself\">Now, I become myself</a>.\u201d In that poem, she talks about trying on other people\u2019s faces and it not working, because it never works. That was me. And now, I\u2019m learning how to be okay with who I am and what I do.</p>\n<h2 id=\"90b5\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\"><strong>Lessons on not scaling your\u00a0business</strong></h2>\n<p id=\"f493\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Seth was right. If you start a business to buy yourself freedom, you are in it for the wrong reasons. Do it because you love it, because it\u2019s your calling, not because you think it\u2019s going to give you the life you want.</p>\n<p id=\"b8e9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">So, here are the lessons I learned:</p>\n<ul class=\"postList\">\n<li id=\"374b\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">\n<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">You can\u2019t have what other people have if you aren\u2019t willing to do what they do.</strong>\u00a0In my case, my ego wanted the prestige that came with having a big company without wanting to spend the time and money to get there.</li>\n<li id=\"9ce0\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">\n<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">Sometimes, you don\u2019t need to grow to get what you really want.</strong>\u00a0For me, the business was a means to make an income while I continue to write.</li>\n<li id=\"2551\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">\n<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">If you feel like you\u2019re losing, change the game you\u2019re playing.</strong>\u00a0Hanging out with my entrepreneur friends always made me feel small and insignificant until I realized we were really playing different games.</li>\n</ul>\n<p id=\"e589\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">Today, there is a lot of pressure for writers and creatives to start a business and make money doing something they\u2019re not passionate about in hopes of finally having the time to do what they really love. On one hand, there\u2019s wisdom here. You don\u2019t want to be another\u00a0<a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://goinswriter.com/die/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"https://goinswriter.com/die/\">Starving Artist</a>, after all.</p>\n<p id=\"0e7e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">But nobody ever told me you can\u00a0create your best work\u00a0<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">and</em>\u00a0thrive. For me, that meant having a business but not feeling the pressure to scale it. It meant being content with where I am and focusing on what I want, which is to be a great writer and spend time with my family.</p>\n<p id=\"23d1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">So that\u2019s what I did, and I couldn\u2019t be happier.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">If you\u2019ve felt the pressure to build something big to do what you really want to do, remember these words: <strong>You don\u2019t have to do this.</strong> You can create the life you want without playing somebody else\u2019s game.</p>\n<p><em>This article was first published on <a href=\"https://medium.com/the-mission/i-once-talked-to-seth-godin-on-the-phone-heres-how-it-changed-my-life-and-business-76be836fa74\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Medium</a>.</em></p>", "spider_name": "techinasia", "id": "techinasia_427260", "has_funding_news": 0.5693081617355347}

Will this be the last you ever hear of Telcoin?</p>\n<p>Its creators, Claude Eguienta and Paul Neuner, think it\u2019ll have staying power because it\u2019s not just another cryptocoin get-rich-quick scheme for early buyers \u2013 it\u2019s a genuinely useful thing that could be adopted by countless people, particularly those without bank accounts.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">Helping people send money home is a good first step.</blockquote>\n<p>Their digital coin is starting out with a focus on online remittances, transfers, and payments \u2013 great for those who are just getting into the swing of online shopping but don\u2019t have credit or debit cards, and for people who need to send part of their wages to family.</p>\n<p>\u201cMoney transfers are a big market where the biggest players still control most of the market share because of their reach and branding.

Indeed, the mobile wallet and the cryptocoin can work in sync.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe majority of global remittances go to countries where mobile money exists and is commonly used, but last year mobile money was involved in less than one percent of the US$500 billion worth of remittances,\u201d Neuner tells <em>Tech in Asia</em>. \u201cThere is a clear opportunity for telecoms to be involved in a larger share of the remittance market, and Telcoin will help them do this.\u201d</p>\n<h2>ICO on the horizon</h2>\n<p>Telcoin, based on the Ethereum blockchain, is set for an ICO on October 30 which will raise an anticipated US$25 million for the young startup. Or maybe more. \u201c[It\u2019s] a target, and not a cap,\u201d points out Eguienta.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt might sound large compared to a seed round, but we have a team, a sales channel, and a product, and we do not want to go back in fundraising mode in 18 months,\u201d he adds.</p>\n<p>Indeed, its fundraise is in line with this year\u2019s boom in ICOs that\u2019s seen <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/1-6-billion-all-time-ico-funding-climbs-as-record-500-million-invested-in-july/\" target=\"_blank\">startups raise US$1.4 billion</a> from January to July by issuing their own digital coins to folks like you and I.</p>\n<p>Eguienta and Neuner have also secured some cash from a VC \u2013 an undisclosed amount from <em>Tech in Asia</em> backer East Ventures, which Neuner describes as \u201ca strategic partner more than a financing source.\u201d</p>\n<p>With all that ammunition from the ICO, the duo can focus on establishing the telco partnerships that\u2019ll get Telcoin into people\u2019s phones.</p>\n<p>Telecoms companies are not exactly known for their innovation, which is why the entrepreneurs think they\u2019ll be keen to get a leg up from a startup. Telcos tend to have issues with \u201cuser experience, international interoperability, fast-paced software development, and ability to take risks in a competitive environment,\u201d says Neuner. Therefore a startup \u201clike ours can help mitigate\u201d those problems.</p>\n<p>Eguienta agrees, seeing that telcos can branch out successfully when they make an online service that\u2019s easy to use.</p>\n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s interesting to compare the success of telco-led mobile money in Kenya with the failure of bank-led mobile money in Nigeria,\u201d says the CEO. \u201cThis is not a trust issue or cultural issue \u2013 people simply want a seamless experience. If Telcoin can help make mobile money more usable, people will use it.\u201d</p>", "spider_name": "techinasia", "id": "techinasia_429239", "has_funding_news": 0.2637408971786499}

But finding them involves a lot of hard work. This article will take you through how a young startup with a software-as-a-service (SaaS) product went about finding the right mentor for it.</p>\n<h3>Abstract:</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.noticeboard.tech/product\" target=\"_blank\">Noticeboard</a> \u2013 founded by three highly trained engineers with top management degrees \u2013 built a work communication tool for large teams on the ground, like construction workers and service staff. In January 2017, the first iteration of the product was out, and it bagged a client within a month. Soon, the startup raised US$1.2 million in venture capital funding.</p>\n<p>Noticeboard went on to rope in more enterprises in the logistics, retail, and hospitality sectors in India as clients, but faced challenges like most young companies. Should they continue to focus on India as the market for their software or should they go after the more lucrative US market? There are several strong competitors out there \u2013 Crew, Red e App, Beekeeper, Connecteam, Staffbase, Microsoft\u2019s Teams, and even Slack. Noticeboard\u2019s founders could do with some expert help to march on or even surge ahead.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>See: <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/noticeboard-slack-2-billion-newbies-to-mobile-internet\">2 billion non-desk workers are strangers to email. These founders built a Slack for them.</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>The learning objective</strong> of this case study is to give a frame of reference other young startups can use to find the right mentors.</p>\n<h2>The premise</h2>\n<p>Noticeboard\u2019s founders Vishal Gahlaut, Vishesh Dahinwal, and Sarath Chandran used to work with Myntra, India\u2019s leading fashion ecommerce company. Flipkart acquired Myntra in 2014 and has been running it as an independent product under the Flipkart umbrella.</p>\n<p>At Myntra, Gahlaut, Dahinwal, and Chandran found that the customer\u2019s happiness rested heavily on how well trained its frontline staff were. To ensure that, the top management of the company had to communicate clearly and constantly with the ground fleet of about 5,000 workers. They were mostly people whose first brush with technology was through their smartphones. They needed a communication tool much simpler than Slack but efficient enough. That\u2019s how Noticeboard was born.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_414419\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Noticeboard-co-founders-Vishal-Sarath-Vishesh.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"950\" height=\"535\" class=\"size-full wp-image-414419\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Noticeboard co-founders [from left to right] Vishal Gahlaut, Sarath Chandran, and Vishesh Dahinwal. Photo credit: Noticeboard.</p>\n</div>\n<p>The stint at Myntra had exposed Gahlaut, Dahinwal, and Chandran to the challenges of scaling up a company as well as how some of the brightest minds in the Indian startup space tackled those. So when the trio decided to start Noticeboard, they had a circle of experts to discuss the idea with, including the founder of Myntra, Mukesh Bansal, and its chief technology and product officer, Shamik Sharma.</p>\n<p>Noticeboard tasted early success, bagging several enterprises in India, including Myntra, as customers. Around six months ago, the founders decided to find mentors who would help them in the next phase of their startup\u2019s growth.</p>\n<h2>Steps that led to the right mentor</h2>\n<p>The founders made a list of potential mentors to begin with. These were expert entrepreneurs and technologists with years of experience in India and abroad. All of them had diverse skillsets which a young startup could gain from.</p>\n<p>Gahlaut, Dahinwal, and Chandran reached out to everyone in their list and requested meetings to discuss Noticeboard. \u201cJust figuring out what kind of value we could expect from the people we have access to took some time. And to figure out how much time we would need from a mentor. Internally, we had several deep discussions on these,\u201d Gahlaut says. He also did a lot of research on mentorship before reaching out to people.</p>\n<p>They shortlisted five from their list and met them each over coffee. \u201cWe shared what we were building and how we were thinking about the business, and asked what they thought about it all.\u201d</p>\n<p>The discussions that ensued were mostly about the space Noticeboard was in, whether it was an investable business or not, and didn\u2019t really go into the specifics. Except with Shamik Sharma. \u201cHe was very different. Instead of talking about the space, he talked about how one should think about the space. He wasn\u2019t polite about what we were doing. \u201cI don\u2019t think you have thought this one through; these are the gaps you might have,\u201d he pointed out things that seemed like mistakes. We debated with him, explained things from our point of view, he listened and responded,\u201d Gahlaut recalls.</p>\n<p>The founders asked for a second meeting with all five of the potential mentors on their shortlist. Some of them didn\u2019t have time for the second meeting. That, Gahlaut says, was an important indicator.  \u201cWhen you ask someone you know for their time, they tend to say yes the first time around. But a second meeting will happen only if what you have to say is exciting for them as well, and is worth their time,\u201d Gahlaut points out.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe generic advice that we got wasn\u2019t very useful for us. Nor was it the best use of their time for the people who were giving that to us.\u201d</p>\n<h2>Finding the man</h2>\n<p>The Noticeboard founders had four \u201cvery long\u201d meetings with Shamik Sharma, even before they talked about mentorship.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe got very deep into every aspect of the company \u2013 from where we sell to whom we sell to, its challenges, how the structure of the team will be, and so on. He was already almost acting like a mentor when we told him that we found our discussions with him extremely useful and that we would like to formalize the relationship,\u201d Gahlaut says.</p>\n<p>Why the need to make things official if it was working well already? \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be in a position where something that you find valuable goes away tomorrow because of some other priorities,\u201d explains Gahlaut. That is how Noticeboard decided to ask Sharma to not only join them as a mentor, but also invest in the startup.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe said that it [the mentor role] won\u2019t come without you investing in us,\u201d Gahlaut recalls telling Sharma. \u201cIf you are invested in our fortunes in some manner, we will be among your priorities and we will also have a right to your time.\u201d</p>\n<p>So Sharma made a small investment in the company and became a mentor to them officially.</p>\n<p>The formal arrangement they arrived at was that Sharma would spend a whole day with the Noticeboard team every fortnight. He was to work with them on the tech and product side largely. He would also help them with hiring, sitting in for recruitment interviews for senior positions.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/noticeboard-screenshots.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"950\" height=\"530\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-414420\"></p>\n<p>Gahlaut gives an example of where Sharma comes in. How to manage notifications inside the Noticeboard app has been a niggling pain. \u201cThe best apps in India have a notification delivery rate of just about 70 percent,\u201d Gahlaut points out. \u201cFor a product like ours, which is a communication platform, notification is our bread and butter. So we spent a lot of time with Shamik on ways to crack this. Should we tweak the notification engine or build something on top of Google Voice to enhance read rates and open rates, and so on.\u201d</p>\n<p>They have been brainstorming \u201ceverything, from the way the Noticeboard feed happens to the admin dashboard that we are building\u201d with Sharma.</p>\n<p>\u201cFrom our perspective, the onus is really on us to draw maximum value out of these sessions with him. Given the stage that we are at, there is a lot to be done in pure execution terms as well. So we have to keep iterating and pushing out tech every fortnight and share it with him,\u201d Gahlaut says.</p>\n<h2>Aces up the mentor\u2019s sleeve</h2>\n<p>Shamik Sharma has had a long tech career in the US.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>After completing masters in computer science from the University of Maryland, College Park, in 1995, Sharma did research on distributed systems. </li>\n<li>He published two papers as a research associate at the university before joining HP as the founding member of its E-Speak team. </li>\n<li>He filed for seven patents during a four-year stint at HP. </li>\n<li>He co-founded Confluent Software. It got acquired by Oblix which in turn was bought by Oracle. </li>\n<li>He headed tech and engineering teams at SOA Software, Yahoo!, StumbleUpon, RockYou, and Lytro before joining Myntra towards the end of 2012. </li>\n<li>At Myntra, he helped the company \u201cgrow from US$30 million to US$1 billion (annualized) revenue,\u201d in four years. He built up a tech team of over 400, and launched several projects such as using AI for fashion design. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u201cShamik championed the mobile-first thinking at Myntra, bringing in a new wave across the Indian startup community. He understands enterprise tech and the mobile space deeply,\u201d Gahlaut says. Myntra was the first paid account for Slack in India. The move to Slack for work communications at Myntra was led by Sharma.</p>\n<p>What makes Sharma special for Noticeboard is not just his tech expertise and connections. \u201cTypically anyone who you know well wouldn\u2019t shy away from connecting people they know. That is not something we were looking for specifically in a mentor. We were scouting for someone who can help us in areas we were not smart about,\u201d Gahlaut says.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe were going to be a tech product company in the enterprise space. As someone who understood enterprise users, had deep interest and understanding in communication technologies, and was a thought leader in the mobile-first thinking, Shamik was the right mentor for us,\u201d Sharma\u2019s experience in the US is also valuable to Noticeboard as they are thinking of expanding beyond India.</p>\n<p>While Sharma has not joined the company\u2019s board of directors, he is the most clued-in hand at Noticeboard after the three founders. \u201cFrom who are the customers, who is reacting in what manner, what are the products we might have synergies with, and so on.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sharma is advising a few other startups as well \u2013 Scripbox, CureFit, Treebo, SquadRun, and BonFleet, to name a few. \u201cWhen he is meeting them, he is also thinking of ways how NoticeBoard can partner with them. He keeps learning about the space, sending us ideas, debating with us,\u201d Gahlaut says.</p>\n<h2>Things to remember</h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_429246\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/mentor-partners-koala.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"950\" height=\"629\" class=\"size-full wp-image-429246\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: Pixabay.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Many entrepreneurs assume that having a big name associated with their company will help in raising funds and so on. But Gahlaut puts a higher premium on insight and time. \u201cUltimately, what counts is if you have an expert resource, you need his time more than anything else. That is the tricky one you should find ways to ensure.\u201d</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Anyone who is not excited enough in your business to invest his own money into it will probably not be in a position to be an effective mentor to you. \u201cThat is because anyone who is good enough to be a mentor has 40 other things to do. Everyone wants their advice, everyone wants their time. And there is limited amount of time they have,\u201d Gahlaut says.</li>\n<li>Unless the founders and the potential mentor are on the same page, the relationship will be just about a meeting or two over coffee where you would exchange pleasantries, get some good advice, and make a few connections on email. That is not mentorship.</li>\n<li>You need to have a clear and open discussion with the person on what will be his contribution, how will you compensate him for his time. Noticeboard has a few other industry leaders \u2013  founder of TaxiForSure Aprameya Radhakrishna, Blackbuck founder Rajesh Yabaji, and YuMe co-founder Jayant Kadambi \u2013 as angel investors, but Sharma is their only official mentor. \u201cHe has more equity than what he would have got from the amount he invested in the company. That\u2019s because we are compensating him for his time as well,\u201d Gahlaut says.</li>\n</ul>", "spider_name": "techinasia", "id": "techinasia_429242", "has_funding_news": 0.300984650850296}

The authorities <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/china-sex-doll-sharing-app-shutdown\">drew the line</a> on a \u201cgirlfriend sharing\u201d service with sex dolls this month, and the startup had to shut down. But there are plenty of other eyebrow-raising items that the Chinese share or buy second-hand online.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a look at the breadth of China\u2019s sharing, renting, and on-demand services economy beyond the ubiquitous bike-sharing and ride-sharing.</p>\n<h2>Used underwear, anyone?</h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_429244\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\">\n<img src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/A-commercial-aircraft-sold-on-second-hand-selling-app-Xianyu-225x400.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"400\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-429244\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A commercial aircraft sold on second-hand goods marketplace Xianyu. Photo credit: Tech in Asia.</p>\n</div>\n<p>The Chinese are digging into their own treasure troves to offer their neighbors a share of what they loved but grew tired of. <a href=\"https://2.taobao.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Xianyu</a>, roughly translated as \u201cidle and excess,\u201d is an app where users can pass around all kinds of second-hand or unused items. Apart from the regular used clothes and shoes, there are also more intimate items such as lipsticks, underwear (worn once), or even rare pets like centipedes. And what\u2019s being sold aren\u2019t just consumer goods: here you can also find a pink diamond, which sold for US$1.15 million; a full-size commercial aircraft, which sold for a bargain at US$76,000, and a lock of long hair, which sold for US$455.</p>\n<p>Apart from the eclectic and personal, there are also apps that offer more functional utilities. If you forget your umbrella on a rainy day, there\u2019s an app that will locate for you the nearest place to borrow an umbrella. Or on a day when your phone is almost out of battery, you can use an app to find the closest charging hub available.</p>\n<h2>Shared living</h2>\n<p>Co-living spaces are gaining ground in all major cities around the world. With rents in big cities becoming increasingly unaffordable for young Chinese, many are turning to shared living spaces. And they have plenty of variety to choose from.</p>\n<p>A popular option is a youth condo, a product akin to a nicely furnished youth hostel. For a rent lower than that of a regular apartment, one can have a small room of 20 to 30 square meters, in addition to the much larger shared area where residents can relax and mingle around a pool table in the lobby, lounging chairs and sofas, and also use a kitchen. It is often branded as a lifestyle choice where professionals can expand their social circle rather than just a place to go to for cheap rent. Among the popular ones in China is <a href=\"https://www.youplus.cc/\" target=\"_blank\">You+</a>, a co-living space backed by Xiaomi\u2019s founder Lei Jun.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>See: <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/tujia-chinese-unicorn-vs-airbnb\">How Chinese unicorn Tujia altered the Airbnb model</a></strong></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_392687\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/16618769_l-750x526.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"526\" class=\"size-large wp-image-392687\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Pedestrians walking in Pudong, where Shanghai\u2019s finance district is located. Photo credit: <a href=\"https://jp.123rf.com/profile_wangsong\" target=\"_blank\">wangsong / 123RF.</a></p>\n</div>\n<p>Another form of shared living space is co-renting, but with total strangers. <a href=\"http://app.zuber.im/\" target=\"_blank\">Zuber</a>, a subletting app, allows users to find roommates and sign legally binding contracts with them. Renters can list their preference for roommates \u2013 from gender and occupation to personality types and horoscopes.</p>\n<p>Real estate agent <a href=\"https://bj.lianjia.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Lianjia</a> has also stepped into the co-living space market by managing sublets for landlords. For example, they will subdivide a four-bedroom flat into four units, each with an electronic lock mounted on the bedroom door.

In the early rush of establishing myself, I made multiple hiring decisions which I would now advise my younger self against.</p>\n<p>At the cost of sounding like a veteran (which I am not, by the way), allow me to share some of my learnings in the hopes of benefiting anyone who reads them.</p>\n<h2>1. Hiring to meet arbitrary deadlines</h2>\n<p>In the initial high of being an entrepreneur, I allocated myself deadlines to meet in every department, including hiring. But not all of them were necessary, and I let internal and perceived time pressures push me into making hasty decisions.</p>\n<p>I would recommend startups not to rush. Don\u2019t hire someone just because you desperately need to fill the position. Take a deep breath and wait until you find the right person, even if it means slowing everything down.</p>\n<h2>2. Hiring those who fit my budget, not requirements</h2>\n<p>While I agree that you need to be pragmatic about budgets, especially if you\u2019re bootstrapping, you need to find motivated people who value passion, creativity, experience, and learning for what it really is beyond money. Never settle on hiring. There\u2019s no purpose in winning a battle but losing the war.</p>\n<h2>3. Hiring for skills, past accomplishments, or pedigree, instead of attitude</h2>\n<p>Nothing beats great attitude. Period.</p>\n<p>This especially impacts the work environment. In startups, you have to sometimes work 16 hours a day, seven days a week. If you don\u2019t have the right attitude, you can\u2019t survive. At Alore CRM, we have a chilled-out culture but are still obsessive about quality and deadlines. It\u2019s OK to turn up to the office in shorts as long as you\u2019re a fun person to work with and deliver what you promise.</p>\n<h2>4. Not hiring a diverse team</h2>\n<p>I cannot tell you enough how valuable it is to have a diverse team, especially in terms of skills. Hire people with passion for their profession and for life: the sales guy who loves photography, the marketing whiz who loves reading, and the finance lady who loves adventures.</p>\n<p>Never ever hire people who have the exact same or very similar skill sets. Different people bring different things to the table, which you need!</p>\n<h2>5. Hiring based on first impressions</h2>\n<p>First impressions aren\u2019t always true. I should know; I\u2019ve gotten burned before. With that in mind, I turned a great piece of advice into a method that\u2019s worked exceedingly well: when interviewing candidates, try to invalidate your first impression of them.</p>\n<p>So, if I liked them at the start, I gradually try to find their faults, and if disliked them earlier, I try to find reasons why they\u2019re smart. It\u2019s a great way to spot the marathon runners amongst the sprinters!</p>\n<h2>6. Hiring someone who isn\u2019t cut out for the startup life</h2>\n<p>Films like<em> The Internship</em> and <em>The Social Network</em> may have glamorized the adrenaline high of having a startup and working in a chilled-out environment, but there\u2019s a whole lot more to it than the zing one expects. The work hours can be long, you don\u2019t always get weekends off, and the salary\u2014at least in the early years\u2014may be comparatively shitty.</p>\n<p>But yes, the promise of success and belief in the vision binds the team. Having a person who isn\u2019t here for that or came in expecting something else would be like how Tom Cruise would feel if he was cast in a Chinese film \u2013 there, but not quite there.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve unfortunately had a brush-in with this too and hired employees with different goals than ours. The result was a too-casual attitude, which negatively affected the team through constant remarks like, \u201cIt\u2019s so unorganized,\u201d or, \u201cThis can\u2019t happen,\u201d or, \u201cI can\u2019t be seriously doing this.\u201d</p>\n<p>Spotting these future detractors before they join is essential. Now, I test a candidate over a day or week by making them see the daily chaos live. The doubters generally jump off the wagon right there, while those who are aligned join in.</p>\n<h2>7. Not defining responsibilities for a role</h2>\n<p>In the initial days, I hired people based mainly on whether I liked and would enjoy working with them, rather than also understanding what they can offer and how they fit into my plan. While having a pleasant colleague is a plus, you\u2019re at a loss if you don\u2019t know how to utilize his/her skills. I shouldn\u2019t hire someone unless I know exactly what I want this person to be doing.</p>\n<h2>8. Not knowing an employee\u2019s motivations</h2>\n<p>Getting swept away by a promising candidate is alright if the vision for growth is aligned. But what if it isn\u2019t?</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve had employees who joined in for the initial euphoria of being in a startup while also expecting fat bonuses, a jet-setting lifestyle, and maybe a magical IPO in the first year. When that didn\u2019t happen, they left.</p>\n<p>I know attrition is a reality of life, but the exit of an employee from a cohesive team at a critical hour does more damage than you imagine. What gets affected most is the morale and spirit of those who stay, and that can take weeks, if not months, to bounce back from. All because you hired a person who never really wanted what you want.</p>\n<h2>9. Not defining my company culture</h2>\n<p>This can be difficult until you\u2019ve figured out what culture you want at your company, one that you yourself feel and breathe every part of. Initially, I found myself going with the flow before realizing that it wasn\u2019t enabling a unified vision and cohesion in the team. Over time, I learned this lesson and drafted a culture document for the company that spells out just who we want to be.</p>\n<p>I now ensure that this document is shared with and agreed upon by every person we hire.</p>\n<p>The company culture is also essential in shaping how you engage with prospects at a first, second, or third degree. If people like you, they\u2019ll remember you and refer you when necessary. I\u2019d like to be remembered, wouldn\u2019t you?</p>\n<h2>10. Hiring friends</h2>\n<p>OK, there might be exceptions to this, but I think this is true close to 90 percent of the time. It seems easy to trust a friend to value your dream and vision as much as you do, but\u00a0that\u2019s where the trouble starts. This seemingly wonderful combination of friend and business partner is not a win-win but, rather, the opposite.</p>\n<p>It can even end up ruining not just professional relationships, but also personal ones. Always remember that the trust between longtime beer buddies might not be enough to handle tough business decisions or cash crunches.</p>\n<h2>11. Not listening to my heart</h2>\n<p>If there is even an iota of doubt after the second or third meeting, don\u2019t hire. Scaling your startup with a new set of people is like the first few years of marriage. You need more than a matchmaking service to make it happen, with the unified will to create and make things happen being number one!</p>", "spider_name": "techinasia", "id": "techinasia_428259", "has_funding_news": 0.4045974612236023}

If it\u2019s not promising, they\u2019ll pass.</li>\n<li>At this stage, VCs usually have multiple discussions with the founders, existing customers, or fellow investors.</li>\n<li>Once they have enough information, they\u2019ll decide whether to invest or not. It often happens during investment committee meetings.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Again, this is a very general framework.</p>\n<h3><b>The \u201chot or not\u201d framework</b></h3>\n<p>If you have one or more of the following, your startup will get accepted much faster:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A proven team with a great track record</li>\n<li>Outstanding metrics</li>\n<li>A unique technology or distribution advantage</li>\n<li>Other VC firms that are ready to invest</li>\n<li>A warm intro</li>\n<li>You\u2019re in a VC-hyped category (e.g. artificial intelligence or blockchain tech)</li>\n<li>Your company fits the VC\u2019s investment thesis perfectly</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is, of course, not a checklist to assess the <em>quality</em> of your company or product. Not having any of these simply means that you\u2019ll probably have a harder time convincing investors initially.</p>\n<p><b>A word on VC FOMO</b></p>\n<p>VCs like to talk to each other and often behave like lemmings. When they see that no one wants to invest in a company, they\u2019ll be very reluctant to do so. If a great investor suddenly decides to put money into a startup, the VCs who passed earlier will reconsider their initial decision.</p>\n<p>Tapping into VC FOMO is a tactic many founders use to capture attention. I don\u2019t advise founders to do this if they\u2019re lying. However, if they do have investors in the pipeline, it\u2019s a good way to accelerate the process.</p>\n<h3>Length of assessment process</h3>\n<p>When your deal is \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25, it can take a few days before you get an answer and receive a term sheet (the document saying that the investor is interested and wants to invest in your company).</p>\n<p>If this is not the case, the length of the process can vary significantly\u2014from a couple of days to weeks or even months. To make a decision, an investor must explore a trend or an industry in depth and speak with the founding team and other investors to understand the opportunity.</p>\n<p>Be prepared to talk to several people at the same firm on multiple occasions. You\u2019ll also be asked to provide more documents other than your pitch deck: more metrics (a product, business, or financial plan), market figures, or even customer references.</p>\n<p>To shorten the length of the assessment phase, do your homework and come to the\u00a0table prepared (see <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/talk/vc-analyst-preparing-fundraise\" rel=\"nofollow\">part two</a> of this series).</p>\n<h3><b>Who decides to push through with a deal?</b></h3>\n<p>As I explained in the <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/talk/founders-guide-before-vc\" rel=\"nofollow\">first part</a> of this series, you have two levels in a fund: people who can make an investment decision (partner level) and people who can\u2019t (analysts, associates, and principals).</p>\n<p>There are varying ways a fund can agree on an investment:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Some require unanimity from all the partners</li>\n<li>Some require just a percentage (e.g. one-third of the partners need to agree)</li>\n<li>In some firms, each partner is responsible for his investment decisions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now that you have a better overview of how a VC firm assesses a deal and how investment decisions are made, let\u2019s go back to our three scenarios.</p>\n<h2>No, we\u2019re not interested</h2>\n<p>This is a bit tough to hear, but receiving a quick no from a VC can be positive, as it means you won\u2019t lose time.</p>\n<h3><b>Should I ask why they said no?</b></h3>\n<p>Yes, you should. Good VCs will tell you their reasons for not investing in your company. If they don\u2019t, it\u2019s good to ask.</p>\n<p>If you think their reason is \u201cVC bullshit,\u201d then it means they were just unconvinced by your founding team, your metrics, or the opportunity.</p>\n<h3><b>Should I be mad?</b></h3>\n<p>No. There are plenty of stories of highly successful founders who were rejected by VCs at the\u00a0early stage (like Airbnb).</p>\n<p>Getting a no doesn\u2019t mean that your startup or project is not worth an investment; it just means that a particular person or fund was not convinced or that it didn\u2019t fit their investment thesis. If you truly believe in your project, it shouldn\u2019t stop you from continuing.</p>\n<h3><b>But I really want this investor with me. Should I insist?</b></h3>\n<p>Insisting too much might hurt your relationship with the VC, so I don\u2019t advise you to do so after you get rejected. A better strategy is to keep the VC informed of your progress. Send them a simple update email every couple of months with your updated metrics. That way, you\u2019ll build a healthier relationship with them. If you show enough progress, you may even land an investment.</p>\n<h2><b>We\u2019re looking at your company</b></h2>\n<p>When a VC notifies you that he has received your deck, it means you\u2019ve entered the assessment phase.</p>\n<p>The duration of the process and the interactions you\u2019ll have with VCs during this process can vary significantly. You\u2019ll either meet a partner quickly, interact multiple times with associates or principals first, or have to send in more material.</p>\n<p>Whether you are hot or not, these first interactions are an excellent opportunity to see how the VC behaves. As you\u2019ll potentially spend a lot of time working with him, it\u2019s vital to validate that you are compatible and respect each other as human beings.</p>\n<p>The longer this phase lasts, the bigger the chances that the investor has either difficulty convincing himself or other members of the investment team.</p>\n<h2><b>You don\u2019t receive an answer</b></h2>\n<p>Getting no response from a VC is probably the most frustrating experience for a founder.</p>\n<p>There are various reasons for this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They are not convinced and are trying to explore the opportunity in more depth</li>\n<li>They are currently under water and cannot progress on your deck</li>\n<li>They forgot about you</li>\n<li>You submitted your deck cold and didn\u2019t follow the instructions on their website</li>\n<li>You haven\u2019t done your homework and contacted the wrong VC or provided a bad pitch deck</li>\n<li>They\u2019re a bad VC who doesn\u2019t care about answering companies which do not interest them</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Whether the investor has a good reason or not, he should at least be transparent and inform you of the next steps. A good tip is always to ask the VC to provide you with an estimated date for his next email. It doesn\u2019t need to be very accurate, but at least you should know whether he\u2019ll come back to you within a week or a month.</p>\n<p><em>This article was first published on the author\u2019s <a href=\"https://medium.com/point-nine-news/an-early-stage-founders-guide-to-working-with-vcs-assessment-phase-hot-or-not-38f42b4a2e05\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Medium page</a>.</em></p>", "spider_name": "techinasia", "id": "techinasia_428935", "has_funding_news": 0.30050501227378845}

Or you need more cash than normal to make an investment. The traditional, but ultimately costly, way would be to take a loan to fill the gap.</p>\n<p>Ang Xing Xian\u2019s father is a fish supplier in Malaysia, and observing this business made Ang understand common cash flow problems. He also learned that there are ways to improve access to cash with technology while he was studying in the UK.</p>\n<p>Ang ended up worked at an invoice financing company there. That\u2019s a type of platform where small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) can sell their yet-to-be-paid invoices to investors or financial institutions who want to purchase future cash flows.</p>\n<p>Back in Malaysia, Ang went on to \u201cboast about this concept,\u201d according to Dion Tan and Edwin Tan. Ang was impressed by how effective it was.</p>\n<p>The two Tans soon became Ang\u2019s co-founders in a startup called <a href=\"https://www.capitalbay.com.my/\" target=\"_blank\">CapitalBay</a>. They wanted to find out how to apply this idea in their home country.</p>\n<h2>Worsening gap</h2>\n<p>As former management consultants, their first instinct was to dig up data to understand the business opportunities.</p>\n<p>\u201cOver the last three years, we conducted an analysis to compare the revenue and trade payables of the relevant top corporations listed on Bursa Malaysia,\u201d Ang says. That\u2019s Kuala Lumpur\u2019s stock exchange.</p>\n<p>They found that the situation was actually worsening for SMEs. Suppliers were having to wait longer and longer before getting paid. And it was the largest of the Malaysian companies who were extending their payment terms more than the other companies.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is not unique to Malaysia,\u201d Ang explains. \u201cMany countries have seen similar issues and their governments stepped in to implement supply chain finance as a solution.\u201d</p>\n<p>Supply chain finance is similar to invoice financing, but takes it one step further.</p>\n<p>A typical transaction cycle could go like this: A supplier requests for early payment on their invoice through the platform. Then, a funder approves and pays the amount to the supplier. The buyer then pays their invoices to the funder at the end of the payment terms.</p>\n<p>But the platform not only allows SMEs to request fast payment, it also incentivizes companies that owe money to suppliers to pay early, at times when they are cash-rich. That\u2019s made possible by the third party financial institutions and banks who sit in the middle. It\u2019s no longer a case of one supplier waiting for the bills to be paid by one particular client. Instead, there\u2019s a marketplace that can fluidly match the need for cash with an oversupply of it across its different members.</p>\n<p>Government supply chain financing schemes have been implemented in the UK, the US, the Netherlands, and India, Ang points out. But in Malaysia the concept is still nascent.</p>\n<h2>Early adopters</h2>\n<p>Ang admits it wasn\u2019t easy to get the first customers to try out CapitalBay, but eventually, they were successful. \u201cSome forward-thinking large corporations spotted this as the opportunity to gain a competitive edge,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Now, a handful of the top Bursa Malaysia-listed companies and their suppliers have completed several transaction cycles through the platform.</p>\n<p>CapitalBay is open to working with all banks and financial institutions and found that it works best for smaller banks that don\u2019t offer similar products. Development banks are another good partner, Ang says.</p>\n<p>For each successful financing transaction, CapitalBay charges a small fee based on the supplier\u2019s invoice amount. Currently, it does not charge any fees to buyers or funders for using its platform.</p>\n<p>The startup today locked in its first round of venture capital, a US$477,000 seed round led by KK Fund. This will be used to accelerate product development and customer acquisition, Ang says. So far, CapitalBay is run by a 10-person team, with a few supporting members in administrative roles.</p>\n<p>Ang believes CapitalBay is the only bank-independent supply chain financing provider in Malaysia for now. Indirectly, it competes with banks who offer traditional financing solutions, he says. But all banks could use the platform to avoid the costs of developing their own supply chain financing products.</p>\n<p><em>Converted from Malaysian ringgit.

After the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the Japanese people were worried about radiation and, despite assurances from authorities that things were under control, remained highly skeptical.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_428891\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter text-center\">\n<img class=\" wp-image-428891\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/5795373811_ff00572434_b.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"343\" height=\"516\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Pieter Franken, co-founder of Safecast.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Franken and his team started Safecast to make sure this lack of information transparency would never happen again. They began building low-cost Geiger counters that people could use to measure their local area for radiation and then upload the data into the cloud for anyone to check.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s my interview with him.</p>\n<h2><b>What is Safecast?</b></h2>\n<p>Exactly six years ago in March 2011, we all witnessed the big earthquake and the Fukushima Daiichi\u00a0Nuclear Power Plant disaster. This was really when Safecast started. The biggest problem was that there was no data on radiation exposure available. So we said, \u201cWe must know what is happening in the environment. How can we make this as open and transparent as possible?\u201d</p>\n<p>We actually thought that the information would be available but just hard to digest. However, that didn\u2019t really fan out, as we realized that the information wasn\u2019t available. So, we said, \u201cOK. Maybe we can crowdsource the data.\u201d The initial idea was to buy Geiger counters, give them to people, have them collect the data, and then we could publish the results. But shortly after the accident, all Geiger counters sold out worldwide because everybody in Japan needed one.</p>\n<p>We then thought that maybe we could do what Google does\u2014a street map view of radiation taken by driving around. So, we did a trial run. We hired a truck driver, gave him a Geiger counter and an iPhone, and we said, \u201cWhenever you stop, just take a measurement and upload it.\u201d So this was kind of the first version.</p>\n<p>This is still what we\u2019re doing; we just automated the process.</p>\n<h2><b>Were you hiring affiliates or was it already a crowdsourcing community?</b></h2>\n<p>What makes this true crowdsourcing is that we didn\u2019t direct people to go do anything. People would raise their hands and we would provide them equipment to go measure. We had maybe a maximum of 10 people in Tokyo that were working in the company, but we had way more people in the field.</p>\n<p>The people who decided to participate were very varied. We had individuals like ourselves, but we also had companies that were already measuring other things on the streets, and they found our initiative interesting. We also had universities, local cities in Fukushima, and a non-government organization.</p>\n<h2>\n<b>H</b><b>ow do you maintain data integrity?</b>\n</h2>\n<p>That\u2019s a fundamental issue. Even if the Geiger counter kits are built in a factory, it is also built by people that soldered them together, so there\u2019s no difference. What does matter is how do you know that the devices are accurate over time? Sensors can go bad and people may have made a mistake building the kit.</p>\n<p>So, with the power of the internet, we don\u2019t just measure locations one time. The idea is that multiple people who actually don\u2019t know each other will measure the same area over time, and this allows us to see anomalies.</p>\n<h2><b>Are there other groups that are sharing, using, or contributing to this data?</b></h2>\n<p>Yes. Everything we do is open and is published under a Creative Commons Zero license. You can go to our website and download all the data we have collected over the last six years, which I think is more than 65 million measurements by now.</p>\n<p>The most common group that uses our data is local governments/groups that use it to look for hotspots or to confirm for themselves that things are as expected. The second most common are researchers. There are a lot of them doing research on the effects of radiation. We also had a Hong Kong artist that used our data to create a virtual tour of Fukushima. We didn\u2019t know he was doing it because he just found the data and used it. We just found out about him later because he was on the internet.</p>\n<h2><b>You\u2019ve received criticism from some people. What\u2019s the basis for this?</b></h2>\n<p>I think the polarization that is happening in our society is increasing. This has made people so detached from using data. If you talk about something and it does not fit what someone else thinks, then you must be on the other side.</p>\n<p>Some people had very strong opinions about the radiation levels in Fukushima. There were people who thought that everybody would die in Japan overnight and there were people that thought there was absolutely no problem. We had people on the extremes who did not look at the data. They thought they already knew the answer, and both extremes were wrong based on our data.</p>\n<p>A lot of people were skeptical in the beginning. If you look at those in the scientific community who have spent their whole lives building super expensive equipment and then you walk in with relatively cheap stuff that actually outperforms this equipment, you\u2019re obviously walking into somebody else\u2019s terrain.</p>\n<h2><b>Has the Japanese government been supportive?</b></h2>\n<p>I would say that in the beginning, they were neither obstructive nor supportive. We kind of worked in our own space. I think now that we have much more interactions, there\u2019s a general interest to understand how we operate and how this works.</p>\n<h2><b>How will citizen science develop in Japan over the next 10 years?</b></h2>\n<p>I don\u2019t know. We\u2019ve been doing so-called citizen science for six years, but I\u2019ve seen other groups doing things in very different ways. What I\u2019m sure about, though, is that we\u2019re going to see more citizen science-like projects that will increasingly be more successful and more impactful. The reason for this is very simple: the technology that drives it is getting cheaper and the access people have to these technologies is getting better.</p>\n<h2><b>If you could change one thing about Japan now, what would you change?</b></h2>\n<p>I think it\u2019s a combination of the education system and the attitude toward risk. If Japan can change that, they will have a much better way to innovate. People are way too worried about the downsides of failure, but failure by definition is not good or bad.</p>\n<p><em>Read more from this series\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/tag/tia-x-dj\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</em></p>", "spider_name": "techinasia", "id": "techinasia_428871", "has_funding_news": 0.5379835367202759}

The team\u2019s vision involves energy solutions that could end up powering a lot more than just their scooter. It hinted at this from the start: When the company launched, its product was only described as \u201ca device around <a href=\"https://www.recode.net/2014/10/30/11632448/former-htc-exec-raises-huge-war-chest-to-launch-gogoro-a-smart-city\" target=\"_blank\">energy management</a>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Gogoro created a network of charging stations called GoStations to support the bike\u2019s energy needs. There, you can swap your vehicle\u2019s spent batteries with fresh ones. The accompanying app shows you the closest battery station and allows you to book fresh batteries in advance. The service, which includes support and road assistance, is offered through a subscription fee.</p>\n<p>At the moment, it has over 400 such stations in Taiwan, with more than 34,000 vehicles sold in the country. But in the future, the charging station model could be used to power other types of vehicles and even serve other energy-related purposes.</p>\n<p>\u201cVehicle makers see how many stations we have and how we can swap batteries anywhere,\u201d Luke, Gogoro\u2019s CEO, tells <em>Tech in Asia</em>. \u201cOther potential industries include logistics and warehousing, or industrial applications.\u201d</p>\n<h2>Fully charged</h2>\n<p>Gogoro announced today it\u2019s raised US$300 million for its series C round. Investors include London-headquartered Generation Investment Management, which is chaired by former US vice president Al Gore and invests long-term in sustainability, clean energy, and mobility projects.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">Gogoro wants to boost its station network so it can better predict demand spikes.</blockquote>\n<p>Also joining in are Singaporean state fund Temasek, Japan\u2019s Sumitomo Corporation, and French electric utility company Engie.

While it\u2019s not making any announcements in terms of new markets, it\u2019s definitely looking at several regions with interest, including scooter-happy Southeast Asia.</p>\n<p>The funding will also go into technology development and hiring. Gogoro wants to boost its station network so it can better predict demand spikes and know when it needs to get more batteries charged. This way, it doesn\u2019t waste energy charging batteries that aren\u2019t going to be used.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as simple as putting a battery [in the station] and charging it,\u201d Luke says.

While it\u2019s managed to get good traction and coverage with its GoStations in Taiwan, it\u2019s not easy to replicate that model elsewhere.</p>\n<p>A partnership with Bosch that kicked off last year allowed it to bring its scooters <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/3/12358280/gogoro-electric-scooter-sharing-app-berlin-taiwan\" target=\"_blank\">to Berlin</a> and, more recently, <a href=\"http://blog.gogoro.com/en/gogoro-coup-paris-expansion-summer-2017\" target=\"_blank\">to Paris</a>, but based on a bike-sharing model. Using an app called <a href=\"https://joincoup.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Coup</a>, people can pick up the scooter closest to them and ride it to their destination.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">In the future, Gogoro\u2019s charging station model could serve other energy-related purposes.</blockquote>\n<p>The company doesn\u2019t use docking or charging stations in this scenario. Instead, it sends its team out to change the batteries of scooters that are running low, while at the same time hiding those scooters from the app.</p>\n<p>In late 2015, Gogoro decided to bring its scooters and network of charging stations <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/gogoro-electric-scooter-launch-amsterdam\">to Amsterdam</a>. Immediately after the announcement, however, it was approached by Bosch with the bike-sharing proposal, so the Amsterdam plans were delayed.</p>\n<p>Gogoro has 1,600 bikes in Berlin and Paris at the moment. Luke says the sharing model could be the way into other territories like Southeast Asia, but the company is still exploring options.</p>\n<p>Coming from HTC, where he served as chief innovation officer, Luke saw first-hand one of the challenges of building hardware products \u2013 customer stickiness. Once someone buys your phone, for example, that\u2019s it from that customer for maybe a couple of years or more.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>See: <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/gogoro-ebike-scooter-taiwan\">Gogoro is a geeky electric scooter with the soul of a motorbike</a></strong></p>\n<p>The way Gogoro works in Taiwan \u2013 selling the bike with a subscription for the batteries on top \u2013 ensures an ecosystem of customers who come back again and again. With a scooter\u2019s average age in the seven-to-10-year range, the subscription revenue gives the company a lot of room for growth and evolution. Luke declines to talk about Gogoro\u2019s revenue in more detail.</p>\n<p>He also believes the timing is right, with several countries including India and China pledging to reduce fossil-based fuel consumption. The opportunity is not lost on competitors either, with manufacturers like BMW and Vespa building their own electric bikes \u2013 although without getting into swappable battery tech like Gogoro.</p>\n<p>Other companies working on batteries for vehicles, except Tesla of course, include Austrian startup <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-19/schwarzenegger-backed-battery-startup-ratchets-up-tesla-fight\" target=\"_blank\">Kreisel Electric</a>.</p>\n<p>The new investment brings Gogoro\u2019s total funding to over US$480 million. The company had previously <a href=\"https://www.gogoro.com/press/releases/2015-11-13-gogoro-df-panasonic-funding/\" target=\"_blank\">raised US$130 million</a> from investors including Panasonic, which works with Gogoro on the scooter\u2019s batteries, and the National Development Fund of Taiwan.</p>", "spider_name": "techinasia", "id": "techinasia_428720", "has_funding_news": 0.9999309778213501}

This means that now, the Alibaba-backed Ele.me and Tencent-backed Meituan dominate the space:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Together, Ele.me and Baidu Waimai make up about 55 percent of the market.</li>\n<li>Meituan has around 41 percent of the market, according to the market research firm iiMedia.(That said, Meituan recently announced that they are at 54 percent.)</li>\n<li>Giants Tencent and Alibaba now dominate online food delivery in China, a business that grew 44 percent annually between 2013 and 2015, according to Bain &amp; Company.</li>\n<li>Baidu now appears to be out of this booming business, which iiMedia says will be worth US$30 billion this year.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, why did Baidu exit, especially after jumping in so aggressively between 2014 to 2015?</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t know the exact reason, but it seems likely that it was to avoid the ongoing operating losses in this hyper-competitive and subsidy-prone business. Plus, both Meituan and Ele.me have been increasing their market share, while Baidu Waimai\u2019s had held at around 13 to 15 percent.</p>\n<p>The more interesting story here, however, is what this deal says about the state of Chinese internet in 2017. I think we can point to three big trends.</p>\n<h2><b>Trend 1: Convergence is continuing</b></h2>\n<p>China\u2019s internet giants (Alibaba, Tencent, and Baidu) are continuing to move into each others\u2019 spaces and are converging. This is a big change from a few years ago when Tencent mostly stayed in gaming and messaging, Alibaba in ecommerce, and Baidu in search. Now, Baidu wants to get into ecommerce, Tencent wants to get into transactions, Alibaba wants to go international and get into entertainment, and so on.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">China\u2019s internet elephants are increasingly rubbing up against each other, and this has interesting consequences.</blockquote>\n<p>China\u2019s internet elephants are increasingly rubbing up against each other, and this has interesting consequences. As the white space between these companies disappears, smaller companies are finding it increasingly difficult to live in that space. As Alibaba and Tencent now dwarf Baidu in market cap, the latter\u2019s exit from food delivery implies that it\u2019s tired of being caught between much larger competitors.</p>\n<p>Another important aspect of this convergence is how these big companies are jumping into areas that are outside of their core competencies. Baidu, a search engine, is jumping into delivery and AI. Tencent, a gaming company, is jumping into on-demand transportation and feature films. Alibaba, an ecommerce company, is jumping into cloud computing. And so on.</p>\n<p>This behavior does change the competitive dynamics of these industries, and it reveals a lot about the differing levels of management ability at these companies. Tencent, in particular, seems very good at jumping out of its core expertise and succeeding in totally new areas, while Baidu has less of a track record.</p>\n<h2><b>Trend 2: China-specific solutions are increasingly important</b></h2>\n<p>The Chinese O2O food delivery trend created an army of delivery people on scooters. They race around streets, alleys, parks, and sidewalks and congregate outside storefronts and subways.</p>\n<p>Mobike and Ofo similarly pioneered bike-sharing, with their unique smart locks and non-inflatable, solid rubber tires. Didi Chuxing pioneered taxi-hailing in coordination with local governments, and Tencent pioneered micropayments, which are increasingly being used in online videos and other places.</p>\n<p>What all of these have in common is that they are very China-specific solutions. They targeted China-specific problems and came up with pretty novel solutions to them. This is an important trend.</p>\n<p>The Chinese market is so big that creative solutions in small niches can be very big businesses. Just try to look for more of these China-specific innovations, especially when it relates to Chinese consumers.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_428568\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-428568\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAqbAAAAJDNjNjY2MDRlLWQyM2MtNGFiMy04ZTJjLTA2MmFkNTRhYzU2Ng.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1983\" height=\"1520\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Delivery scooters congregating outside subways.</p>\n</div>\n<h2><b>Trend 3: The Chinese internet is prone to money wars</b></h2>\n<p>The online delivery business that Baidu just exited has been notorious for its brutal money war. The leading companies have been subsidizing the business and offering customers lower prices to gain market share. And, unsurprisingly, the companies that can raise capital in larger amounts more inexpensively tend to win these money wars over time. Baidu\u2019s decreasing ability to compete with the much larger Tencent and Alibaba in this way is something important to note.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_428569\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-428569\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAu7AAAAJDcwODg2YmQxLTY1NTItNDVlYy04ZDEwLWVkNmU1ZGZkOTQyNQ.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2343\" height=\"1833\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Most large restaurant chains in China are now expanding in direct delivery.</p>\n</div>\n<p>These money wars do tend to happen a lot in the Chinese internet space. They have happened in online travel sites, ride-sharing, O2O delivery, and other sectors. Kuaidi vs Didi and Didi vs Uber China were particularly spectacular examples of this.</p>\n<p>This is not limited to the internet space, but it does seem to happen more there (or at least it gets more publicity). This could be because of the sexier nature of internet companies and their ability to raise capital. It could also be from the winner-take-all economics of many platform and software businesses such as Didi and Meituan. But I expect these money wars to continue as a common strategy for market leaders.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>China\u2019s propensity for money wars will probably accelerate\u00a0another trend: the consolidation of certain parts of the internet space. As user growth slows, customer acquisition and retention costs usually increase. The fight for an open, growing market is replaced by a fight to steal customers from competitors. Many smaller companies find they can\u2019t afford to play this game and eventually merge or sell. So, you naturally get consolidation.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading!</p>\n<p><em>This article was first published on the <a href=\"http://jefftowson.com/2017/09/the-sale-of-baidu-waimai-to-ele-me-symbolizes-3-big-china-internet-trends/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">author\u2019s blog</a>.</em></p>", "spider_name": "techinasia", "id": "techinasia_428550", "has_funding_news": 0.40730535984039307}

It is filled with doubt, excitement, insecurity, and a sense of achievement all at once.</p>\n<p>My two friends and I founded NoBroker, a C2C brokerage-free real estate marketplace in India, over three years ago. We bootstrapped for a good time, worried about funds, raised three rounds of funding, established our first office in a house, got some great founding team members, agreed and disagreed with each other, received both criticisms and praises from our customers, and expanded our customer base.</p>\n<p>In this eventful journey, we made many mistakes. So, let me share some of the big pitfalls here.\u00a0We entrepreneurs have done enough mistakes. It\u2019s time to learn from each other.</p>\n<h2><b>Should I put my best foot forward when I talk to people?</b></h2>\n<p>We entrepreneurs are generally never satisfied with what we build. We want to fine-tune our product more and more before we show it to the world. We want to be well-prepared when we talk to customers and VCs. But\u00a0this often backfires.</p>\n<p>I have a founder friend who spoke to a customer too late. The customer told him, \u201cYes, the product is good. But I don\u2019t think we will ever have a budget for these services.\u201d Imagine yourself in his place. Burning midnight oil for months, perfecting the product, and missing to ask a simple question: Will my customer ever have a budget to buy?</p>\n<p>Another friend of mine approached VCs who told him, \u201cThe product is good and the customer problem is real. But the market size is too small. Didn\u2019t you notice?\u201d</p>\n<p>In our company\u2019s case, thankfully, we learned from others\u2019 mistakes. We bounced ideas off our friends in the VC community while building the product. We asked questions like, is the market big enough? Where did other firms falter in the past? Is this a VC-fundable business? We spoke with friends and potential customers and got practical insights. We did mystery shopping and understood the pain points that our competitor was unable to solve.</p>\n<p>The trick was to keep the product/service iterative. Talk to people and learn something. Use that learning to modify your product/service. Then, make it live and gather feedback. Then, again, talk to people, learn more, and repeat the cycle. Don\u2019t wait.</p>\n<h2><b>Is scaling the main game?</b></h2>\n<p>Yes, we want to be 10x bigger than what we are now. But how soon? On which dimension? The real dilemma here is a short-term quick jump in metrics vs long-term sustainability.</p>\n<p>A business can be a depth game or a width game. Which one did I choose? NoBroker helps owners and seekers meet each other directly without a broker in between so they can save on transaction costs. In this business, the customer need is micro-market-based. The matchmaking is micro.</p>\n<p>Let me explain. A customer has a house with X dimensions in locality Y, with rent/sale amount of Z. We need to find a seeker who wants exactly these X, Y, and Z. So, this is more of a depth game where penetration and building a network in the same city is beneficial to both the business and the customers.</p>\n<p>Did we also want to play the width game, which is about having presence in more cities? Yes, we wanted to expand; we are in five cities now. But for us, depth is more important than width. The priority is clear, and our team and investors understand this.</p>\n<p>So, what is more important for your business? Width or depth? The answer seems obvious in hindsight. But with competitors breathing down your neck and VCs hungry for quick numbers, this is a dilemma that only us, entrepreneurs, can truly understand.</p>\n<h2><b>Should you do what VCs say?</b></h2>\n<p>A partner in a VC firm told me about a mind-boggling observation. He said that companies who look to him for advice and execute the idea like great managers give huge satisfaction to him personally. But companies like that almost never succeed! Those founders behave like project managers and are never able to navigate through very difficult times.</p>\n<p>I suspect that every gray-haired VC knows this. Yes, VCs have seen the world and their advice is often well-meaning. But sometimes, it is not because their time horizons are different from yours. Sometimes, they need to artificially fatten you up to feed their shares to a bigger fish. Don\u2019t partner with such guys. If you are stuck, speak up. Tell them what your customers are telling you, the impact of certain decisions on cash flows, and other long-term business implications. Debate and decide.</p>\n<h2><b>Is GMV still important?</b></h2>\n<p>What about app downloads? Yes, a lot of other metrics are important. But so is revenue minus cost. The dilemma here, again, is timing.</p>\n<p>For many businesses, marketing budgets and significant cash burns are initially required.\u00a0But don\u2019t be complacent about those metrics. Until the profit line is missing from P&amp;L, it\u2019s best to feel constantly jittery and uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>Our GMV at NoBroker is big. But is it relevant to us? Yes, partly. Is it the most important metric for us? No. Since we focus on helping customers save on real estate brokerage fees, the number of deals closed is more relevant to us than the GMV.</p>\n<p>The risk in tracking vanity metrics is that they mislead you into believing them. So, sit down and think. What is the metric that will snowball your firm into a strong, long-term pricing power and sustainability? Track that.</p>\n<h2><b>Should we wait to hire HR and finance talent?</b></h2>\n<p>In startups, everybody needs to behave as an HR manager to build and preserve the culture. And everyone needs to focus on revenue and expenses to develop a reasonably frugal culture. But this does not mean that the support talent should not be hired quickly.</p>\n<p>I can say from firsthand experience that having great HR and finance staff not only saves a precious founder\u2019s time but also ups the standards of the entire game. I mistakenly felt that there should be full-time work for support functions before we hire them. What did we do until then? We passed check entries, spoke with vendors directly, and typed offer letters to new joiners. It was a big mistake. It sucked our time away from building the business. Things quickly grew out of control. When we eventually did hire people in support functions, we marveled at their competence and realized how badly we had needed them.</p>\n<p>So, if you are still waiting for a full-time support function work profile to be created, please stop. Hire good people in support functions now, as they return amazing ROI.</p>\n<h2><b>Should founders maintain control?</b></h2>\n<p>I am a founder and I have been nurturing the vertical aspects of the business. When a new hire comes up and screws even a portion of it, I hate it. I would know that I should not have delegated. I would say, \u201cOK, OK. I will delegate but keep me in the loop.\u201d But should founders actually be kept in the loop? No, since we have a view on everything. The business is our baby.</p>\n<p>Well, the only way out is to define the maximum impact of error and go into what is called the \u201cdegree of optimal ignorance.\u201d This means that as a founder, I don\u2019t need to know everything. Let some things be delegated but define maximum failures.</p>\n<p>For example, in digital marketing, I just need to know the final output in terms of customers acquired and costs incurred. I do not need to know the exact keywords for which the bidding was done. As a founder, I need to be comfortable with this feeling where I don\u2019t need to know everything. This ensures that my company has the potential to scale without me being a hindrance. So, as a founder or leader of your team, take a deep breath, relax, and delegate.</p>\n<h2><b>Should I hire that McKinsey guy?</b></h2>\n<p>How cool would it be to hire an ex-McKinsey guy for your company? We entrepreneurs often want to hire \u201cindustry celebrities.\u201d But does it work? No, it never does.</p>\n<p>Hire the guy if he has passion for the problem you are solving, whether he\u2019s ex-McKinsey or not. There is no substitute for passion and hunger. At our company, we look for passion first. Is it oozing out of the guy? Your people should also think about your customers. They should be willing to fight with founders for the customers\u2019 sake. Lastly, they should take ideas and make them their own.</p>", "spider_name": "techinasia", "id": "techinasia_427352", "has_funding_news": 0.6183557510375977}

Photo credit: <a href=\"https://www.123rf.com/profile_manjik\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">manjik / 123RF Stock Photo</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<p>A few days ago, I had the opportunity to speak at the Indonesia International Conference on Innovation, Entrepreneurship, and Small Business (IICIES) organized by the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.itb.ac.id/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Institut Teknologi Bandung</a> (ITB), one of Indonesia\u2019s premier tech institutes. I remember reading that the school has spawned many startup founders in the country. I took this opportunity to spend a bit of time analyzing where Indonesia lacks as a startup ecosystem and what we can do at the grassroots level to improve it.</p>\n<p>By investor accounts, the deal quality in Indonesia has not been up to the mark lately. It has been difficult for all of us to find a good-quality deal flow, and the few companies that exist get chased by local and international investors incessantly, driving up valuations and making the deal less attractive for everyone else on the table.</p>\n<p>Don\u2019t get me wrong, a lot is also going right in Indonesia. The buzz in the startup scene is reminiscent of India in 2014 when the country hit an inflection point in startup creation and funding. But to be able to sustain this initial momentum, we now need to prop up the whole startup base on a strong foundation.</p>\n<h2>Four strong\u00a0pillars</h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_428522\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-428522\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/1kNuhNWiXxKjtSyooFcwf6Q.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"847\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Four pillars of a healthy startup ecosystem.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Similar to how farming needs key variables for success, a startup ecosystem also needs to be built with some fundamentals to truly mature.</p>\n<h3><b>1. Entrepreneur</b></h3>\n<p>It all starts with the entrepreneur, of course. Without a strong entrepreneurial DNA in the market, you are unlikely to find good upcoming companies. I\u2019ve seen this hunger in the Indonesian people firsthand. While the culture might not be as aggressive as that of India or China, the people are ambitious in their dreams and possess the stamina to pursue them. This combination is a must.</p>\n<h3><b>2. Talent</b></h3>\n<p>Once the entrepreneur has embarked on their idea, the next task is to build a strong support team for execution. This is where the problems start in developing markets, especially in Indonesia.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_428523\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-428523\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/1kcEQgS-hpBNLTA1pGO4Jog.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"765\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: StackOverflow.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Tech talent is a known challenge. According to data from StackOverflow, one of the most popular websites for amateur and professional developers alike, Indonesian developers are one of their lowest contributors amongst big population countries. Even the Philippines ranks higher. As you can see in the chart above, India is leading the charge amongst developing markets, and this is one of the biggest reasons its market is exploding in recent years.</p>\n<p>Business skills are easier to learn than tech skills. You can figure out your way on the job if you are smart enough, but if you don\u2019t know how to build a mobile application and can\u2019t afford to hire the right talent to do so, then the barrier to start a business becomes quite high.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s no surprise that companies such as Grab and GoJek are setting up their R&amp;D hubs in India. Indonesia needs to act immediately to plug this talent gap. Otherwise, job creation, one of the biggest benefits of creating a startup ecosystem, will elude the country.</p>\n<h3><b>3. Funding</b></h3>\n<p>I have touched on this before in my <a href=\"https://grayscale.vc/o-angel-where-art-thou-97ee13118cad\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">post here</a>. Contrary to popular opinion, I feel there is an early-stage funding crunch in Southeast Asia. While there are enough seed and maybe series A funds in the market, there is simply not enough angel activity.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_428524\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-428524\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/1LmOKPR9yPbfrIrbumGo1Gw.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"920\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: CBInsights.</p>\n</div>\n<p>As you can see in the chart above, while the number of VC-backed seed rounds, when scaled by population, are similar for both India and Indonesia, angel activity is miles apart. The angel community in Indonesia needs to step up and take the product-market fit risks that VCs are usually unwilling to take. If left to VCs, it is likely that only the business models that make sense will get funded, and this is detrimental to the overall ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Innovation is brought about by experimenting and solving problems unique to these markets. Many VCs are unwilling to take this business model risk, but angels can, given their diversified portfolio strategy.</p>\n<h3><b>4. Exits</b></h3>\n<p>Enough VCs have complained about this in the past. While the M&amp;A market is starting to pick up in the tech sector (see our exit of Kudo to Grab), traditional corporates in Indonesia are <a href=\"https://www.dealstreetasia.com/stories/indonesian-listed-firms-sit-70b-cash-pile-perform-limited-ma-activity-bain-co-report-81591/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">yet to start buying</a>. Further, the public markets in the country are weak.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_428525\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-428525\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/1-ET9gE5kU30T7wtfAo7Bxg.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"889\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: SEC, IDX, BSE, HKSE.</p>\n</div>\n<p>While the difficulty to list in the market is a big factor, improved regulations alone are not going to swing the needle in favor of tech IPOs. The investor base simply doesn\u2019t exist in the Indonesian public market. Take a look at the comparison above of the daily trading volume of traditional equities in various stock exchanges. Indonesia has a long way to go in this regard, and until this volume picks up, no startup or investor will consider IDX as a viable option for exits.</p>\n<h2><b>Three problems, three solutions</b></h2>\n<p>How do we fix this, especially from a school\u2019s point of view? There are of course no magic bullets, but we can start initiatives to address these problems, both in the long and short term.</p>\n<h3><b>1. Educate</b></h3>\n<p>While there are enough entrepreneurial programs and probably too many incubators and accelerators, I would love to see programs that aim to plug the talent gap in the ecosystem. These should be focused on practical skills such as engineering, technology talent, digital marketing, and operations. The skills required in the workforce in today\u2019s day and age are very different from those required 10 years ago. The education system needs to evolve to match the needs of the market.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_428527\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-428527\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/1m-Wso0qNOmXmnfJSVtha8w.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1204\" height=\"370\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tech universities in Indonesia.</p>\n</div>\n<h3><b>2. Upskill</b></h3>\n<p>One of the best programs by the National University of Singapore (NUS) is the NUS Overseas College where students get a chance to spend a semester in a growing startup. This way, you upskill students in practical skills that they can use straight out of university.</p>\n<p>Indonesia has enough scaled-up startups like Bukalapak, GoJek, Grab, Tokopedia, and Traveloka to be able to offer hundreds of internships to students from top institutes. The schools need to kick off these training partnerships immediately.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_428528\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-428528\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/1OIMd3DuyXt2ZR_EVJ1BTOw.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1350\" height=\"164\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Large tech companies in Indonesia.</p>\n</div>\n<h3><b>3. Fund</b></h3>\n<p>Angel activity in Indonesia is bound to increase when the first wave of startups find an exit and their management and employees find liquidity. While most angels currently come from a traditional business background, what we really need are the been-there-done-that founders to back the next generation of founders, and this will eventually happen.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_428526\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-428526\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/12LifjxNPydC5YNeRpuTpDA.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1340\" height=\"566\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Angel funds of global institutions.</p>\n</div>\n<p>In the meantime, institutes such as ITB can start bringing together their alumni network to bridge this gap. Most of the top schools worldwide have an angel fund that provides risk capital to its students and alumni for experimentation. I personally prefer that this money be invested in entrepreneurs after they graduate, rather than during their studies. This gives them enough capital to survive out of college while not taking a job they would otherwise take just for the money. It can also be used to fund the alumni\u2019s new ventures and should not be restricted to only fresh graduates.</p>\n<p>These are just a few ways to boost the Indonesian ecosystem right now. There are many more actions that can be taken by all of us to help overcome the challenge we are facing. I implore all of you to play your part in this equation.</p>", "spider_name": "techinasia", "id": "techinasia_428508", "has_funding_news": 0.5335454940795898}

{"article_id": "428191", "article_title": "How bike-sharing is scaling so fast and for free", "story_url": "https://www.techinasia.com/talk/bikesharing-grows-fast-free", "author": "Jeffrey Towson", "time": "2017-09-18T08:52:36", "content": "<p>From the beginning of the China bike-sharing phenomenon, I have been struck by how quickly these companies have become so pervasive. Just think of how often you see a Mobike or Ofo bike in China. You see these brightly-colored bikes literally thousands of times every day on the street, in the park, near the subway, and so on. I sometimes count how long it takes for me to see another of these bikes. I rarely make it to 10 seconds.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/talk/china-bike-sharing-powerful\" rel=\"nofollow\">part one</a>, I argued that the startling power of these businesses follows from their deployment of \u201cwild assets\u201d in huge numbers. In this part, I dig into how their usage has grown so fast.</p>\n<h2>What does it take to scale a bike-sharing company?</h2>\n<p>I spoke with Chris Martin, Mobike\u2019s vice president for international expansion, about how bike usage grows in a city vs the number of bikes deployed. And it turns out it is pretty complicated, as the growth depends on a few things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>The city itself</strong>: Is it flat or hilly? What is the geographic size? What is the population size? What is the population\u2019s economic level?</li>\n<li>\n<strong>The degree of local competition</strong>: Is it an open market or are there already significant competitors?</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Public transportation systems</strong>: According to the 2017 Kleiner Perkins/Hillhouse Capital Internet Trends report, 50 percent of bike rides in China are going to the subway or back (see their chart below).</li>\n<li><strong>Mobile payment adoption</strong></li>\n<li>\n<strong>Other factors</strong>: Government support, consumer adoption rates, and so on.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One thing is clear. These bikes grow organically and rapidly in their usage, and this growth requires virtually no marketing spend or support from headquarters. It is an amazing phenomenon that is driven almost entirely by the bikes (i.e. the wild assets) themselves.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_428232\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-428232 size-full\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAvCAAAAJDY1NjYwMmYxLTM5NjctNDBkNS05ZDUyLWFjOTUyN2IzYTJmYg.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1536\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.kpcb.com/internet-trends\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Kleiner Perkins</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<p>It is worth discussing in detail how usage actually grows in a city.</p>\n<p>For bike-sharing, the process typically begins with deploying a small number of bikes. For example, when launching in Manchester, Mobike started by placing about 1,000 bikes on the downtown streets. They did this as part of an official launch day\u00a0when they also had a promotional event.\u00a0But basically, it involves deploying a small number of bikes, getting the word out to some degree, and then simply waiting.</p>\n<p>What happens next is important. Eventually, curious people walk up and check out the unusual bikes. When these bikes are in public spaces, like downtown sidewalks, people notice them as they walk by. They stand out on a sidewalk in a way a new product on a store shelf does not.</p>\n<p>A few daring customers (i.e. the early adopters) see the bikes, stop, and download the app on their smartphone. They register and pay the deposit successfully and then just scan the QR code on the bike, hop on, and ride off.</p>\n<p>The important factor in this process is that the bikes themselves attract the users, get them to download the app, and then deliver the service to them. The marketing, sales, and delivery of the service are all done by the asset on the sidewalk. This was my definition of a \u201cwild asset\u201d in part one. Attribute two of my definition was that <strong>the asset can market, sell, and/or deliver its product or service mostly on its own</strong>.</p>\n<p>And while a stationary bike in a public space gets noticed, a moving one is much better. Virtually everyone on the street notices the early adopters riding around town on these bikes. So then other people download the app and try unlocking a bicycle themselves. Word of mouth is important at this stage.</p>\n<p>Usage then starts to increase naturally and organically, attracting middle-class customers. As usage increases, Mobike deploys more bikes, and the self-selling process repeats itself. So, more bikes mean\u00a0more marketing and more sales. The service quickly appeals to the mass market, used by virtually every demographic within a city.</p>\n<p>Below is a chart from Mobike\u00a0of usage vs the number of bikes deployed for a typical Chinese city with 8 million people. Note that it is fairly linear and not exponential like that of social media.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_428230\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-428230 size-full\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAqmAAAAJDYwYTVjNTA5LTA1MGMtNDcwNS1hMWI1LWRmZjFmODU5OWU3Yg.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1066\" height=\"534\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: Mobike.</p>\n</div>\n<p>While Mobike supported their launch process with an event on day one, they were really not significantly marketing or spending on sales by day three. The growth curve shown above happened on its own, and that is the power of wild assets. Following the launch in Manchester, the company reportedly had 20 percent day-on-day growth in usage for several weeks. The more bikes they deployed, the more growth in usage there was.</p>\n<p>I asked Martin what he thought the biggest challenge was for growing usage, and he replied it was mostly about removing barriers to adoption. This means getting government approvals and support, making registrations and payments as easy as possible, and placing bikes in the right places.</p>\n<h2><b>My definition for assets in the wild</b></h2>\n<p>In part one, I argued that a wild asset has three key attributes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The asset can exist mostly on its own in the wild.</li>\n<li>The asset can market, sell, and/or deliver its product or service mostly on its own.</li>\n<li>The asset can be released in large numbers.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I think this definition captures much of the above story. Very few products and services have this much impact in a community and grow this fast organically, and even fewer do so for free (after the cost of the bikes).</p>\n<h2><b>Better than WeChat and Coca-Cola?</b></h2>\n<p>Two companies that come to mind when thinking about this rapid rate of adoption are WeChat and Coca-Cola, as both have tremendous sales and marketing power.</p>\n<p>At the same time that Facebook and WeChat were spreading really quickly, everyone started talking about the power of social media and \u201cviral marketing.\u201d Viral marketing travels from person to person, usually between friends and colleagues. It is also very low-cost, if not free.</p>\n<p>So this is somewhat similar to what is going on with these bikes. But social media and viral marketing tend to be exponential, not linear. And they are largely an online phenomenon while bike-sharing is happening in the real world.</p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-428234 size-full\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAvdAAAAJGMyNDYwZTgxLTVjMDUtNGU0My1iMDYzLTliMTVjNDdjMDg0Nw.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2592\" height=\"1936\"></p>\n<p>Coca-Cola is arguably the champion in China in terms of real-world product marketing and sales. They have overwhelming distribution, sales, and marketing reach. You can buy a Coke on literally every block in China\u2014in supermarkets, convenience stores, vending machines, or even in little stalls. Their marketing is also everywhere\u2014on billboards, signs at stores, little stalls, and so on. So, this is a physical product with a dominant presence, like these on-demand bicycles.</p>\n<p>I think the difference is that Coca-Cola is largely within traditional distribution and retail channels, while these bicycles exist in the public space. And it also took Coca-Cola 20+ years to build such a presence in the real world. Bike-sharing happened in about 12 months.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Assets in the wild have a sales and marketing power similar to these big companies, but it is also clearly something new. They are somewhat online like WeChat but are also a physical product like Coca-Cola. But the product exists outside of traditional distribution and retail channels, and the product sells itself without staff or stores like vending machines.</p>\n<p>The more you dig into these questions, the more interesting it gets. Deploying huge numbers of mostly independent assets into the wild strikes me as an entirely new thing and something that is impressively powerful and just beginning.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s it for part two. In part three and four, I\u2019ll go into the economics of these assets and what I think is coming next.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading!</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_428229\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"wp-image-428229 size-full\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/AAEAAQAAAAAAAA0UAAAAJDNmYjM2YWNjLTNkZjItNGVjYi1iNjE5LTdiMjVmYjIzNzQ5MQ.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2360\" height=\"1883\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Youon bikes always look like Ofo and Bluegogo bikes had a baby to me.</p>\n</div>\n<p><em>This article was first published on the <a href=\"http://jefftowson.com/2017/09/how-bike-sharing-grows-so-fast-and-for-free-pt-2-of-4/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">author\u2019s blog</a>.</em></p>", "spider_name": "techinasia", "id": "techinasia_428191", "has_funding_news": 0.5556033849716187}

Photo credit: oDoc.</p>\n</div>\n<p>The island nation south of India with its gorgeous beaches, rainforests, and ancient Buddhist ruins just saw one of its startups \u2013 medtech app <a href=\"http://odoc.life/\" target=\"_blank\">oDoc</a> \u2013 score US$1 million seed funding.</p>\n<p>This is the largest seed investment round for any startup in Sri Lanka.</p>\n<p>The country\u2019s startup ecosystem is still very young with over <a href=\"https://slasscom.lk/sites/default/files/Startup%20Sri-Lanka%20Report%202016%20%281%29.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">50 percent</a> of its entrepreneurs using their personal savings to fund their companies. The seed funding round for oDoc comes at an opportune time as the island\u2019s mass market is embracing tech through new ride-hailing options.</p>\n<p>ODoc isn\u2019t going after the mass market though \u2013 at least not yet. The app connects patients with doctors for video consultation. Say you wake up in the morning with a nasty rash and fever. Three taps on your smartphone and you can submit your pre-consultation notes, take a picture of your rash, and get a doctor to review those. A doctor will call you and send his prescription with the doctor\u2019s seal and signature right to your phone. All done in 10 minutes.</p>\n<p>Many startups around the world have been at it but oDoc\u2019s four founders \u2013 with their diverse backgrounds \u2013 approached it more from a design perspective than as a tech problem to solve.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe reason nobody has really cracked it is because they looked at it as a medical problem. They were building it as an Uber for doctors of sorts. But it is really about changing behavior. So it is more of a design problem. It needed a fresh set of eyes,\u201d the founders tell <em>Tech in Asia</em>.</p>\n<h2>Stalking investors</h2>\n<p>The credentials of the founders plays a key role in instilling investor confidence, especially in the early stage of a startup when the product usage is yet to take off. That\u2019s true for oDoc as well.</p>\n<p>Before turning entrepreneur, oDoc CEO Heshan Fernando was the youngest assistant vice president of Sri Lanka\u2019s largest listed company <a href=\"http://www.keells.com/\" target=\"_blank\">John Keells Holdings</a>. He holds four majors \u2013 in mathematics, statistics, economics, and operations research \u2013 from the University of Warwick.</p>\n<p>ODoc\u2019s tech head Sohan Dharmaraja \u2013 with a PhD in computational applied mathematics from Stanford and masters from MIT \u2013 was an algorithmic trader with Goldman Sachs. He had built a braille keyboard app for the blind when was in the US.</p>\n<p>Dharmaraja came back to Sri Lanka after his PhD. He tells <em>Tech in Asia</em> that he didn\u2019t want to be just another expat critiquing his home country from afar instead of trying to push change himself.</p>\n<p>Back home in Lanka, he started marketing tech startup SocialRoo with data analytics before moving to a consulting business. But he found it tough to convince companies in Sri Lanka what data analytics could do for their business.</p>\n<p>Dharmaraja finally found his metier in oDoc, which has two more co-founders: Inshard Naizer, Fernando\u2019s former colleague from John Keells, and Dr. Janaka Wickremesinghe, a general physician who holds three patents. Dr. Wickremesinghe is also the founder of Sri Lanka\u2019s first online medical education platform CorpusMedici \u2013 which a third of all doctors in the island nation subscribe to, according to Fernando.</p>\n<p>The investors who pumped in the US$1 million are Ajit Gunewardene, deputy chairman of John Keells; Phoenix Ventures, the investment arm of Sri Lankan apparel exporter Brandix; and Loits, the IT arm of conglomerate <a href=\"http://lolc.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Lolc</a>.</p>\n<p>The oDoc team started the fundraising efforts early this year.</p>\n<p>Gunewardene has known Fernando for nine years now, and he was also one of their mentors. \u201cEven with him we walked a very fine line between being persistent and getting a restraining order,\u201d Fernando jokes. \u201cWe assumed it would take us three months, but kept a six-month timeline. It ended up taking nine months,\u201d he tells me.</p>\n<p>Gunewardene\u2019s endorsement piqued the interest of the other two investors, and finally, the team clinched the deal last week. The money has hit oDoc\u2019s bank account and the team is going to hire more hands and start marketing their product now.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>See: <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/6-years-bloody-civil-war-sri-lanka-bets-startups-lures-investors\">6 years after a bloody civil war, Sri Lanka bets on startups, attracts investors</a></strong></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_428179\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-428179\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/oDoc-Promo-Image.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"950\" height=\"560\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: oDoc.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>AI to help doctors diagnose better</h2>\n<p>The founders spent 12 months designing and building oDoc, which they describe as a \u201c360 degree solution\u201d \u2013 providing pre-consultation notes, video calls, and the prescription sent to your smartphone.</p>\n<p>They began by building an electronic medical record system that would allow a doctor to document a consultation digitally. \u201cWe believe that there is a lot of power and insights that can be gathered from the consultation data which will be passing through our system. We want to collect, store, and analyse that data to provide insights to the doctors, and eventually move into a point where some of the consultation can be automated using AI,\u201d Dharmaraja says.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">Tap a button and you can consult a doctor anonymously too but then you won\u2019t get a prescription.</blockquote>\n<p>For example, the AI could assist the doctor in diagnosis by reading the patient\u2019s complaints or if the doctor is prescribing a medicine, the system can suggest the right dosage automatically.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere were nuances in this space that had to be built into the product. Trust between the doctor and the patient, for example. You don\u2019t need to be convinced of the skills of a driver when you are trying to book a cab. But patients will always have a concern about how good a doctor is. We built the app taking such nuances into consideration,\u201d Dharmaraja says.</p>\n<p>Patients will be charged a consultation fee, of which oDoc will get a percentage. The startup is mulling a subscription model as well, Fernando adds.</p>\n<p>The oDoc app is available in three languages \u2013 English, Sinhalese, and Tamil. Its immediate goal is to get product-market fit. In the next five months, they\u2019re aiming for 1,000 successful consultations \u2013 where doctor and patient are happy with the experience.</p>\n<p>But there are inherent challenges. For instance, although a little over one-third of Sri Lanka\u2019s 20 million people have smartphones, only around <a href=\"https://www.pressreader.com/sri-lanka/daily-mirror-sri-lanka/20170418/282011852232695\" target=\"_blank\">four million</a> use the internet. There is 3G coverage in 75 percent of the country, and the big cities have 4G as well.</p>\n<p>To begin with, oDoc requires a mindset shift in the users who have to get familiar with the idea of video consultation as an effective form of medical care delivery. \u201cPeople have doubts like \u201cIs this prescription really valid? Can I go to a pharmacy and show this to them?\u201d Legally, there is nothing wrong with it but not many people know that,\u201d Fernando says.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>See: <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/vc-startup-helping-sri-lanka-find-spot-global-tech-map\">Sri Lanka isn\u2019t synonymous with world class tech. But that might be about to change.</a></strong></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_282791\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-282791\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/colombo.jpg\" alt=\"sri lanka\" width=\"837\" height=\"626\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Colombo, Sri Lanka.

For years, radiologists in India have been consulting with hospitals in Africa using digital technology. But when it comes to conditions that need immediate attention, even if they are minor, video consultation has not caught on in India or Southeast Asia yet.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">To begin with, oDoc requires a mindset shift in the users.</blockquote>\n<p>The convenience factor could do the trick though. For example, an app like oDoc could reduce leg work for chronic patients who go to a doctor every month to show a blood report. They could just click a picture of the report and talk to the doctor about it from anywhere.</p>\n<p>For patients with mental or sexual health problems, who are hesitant to go to a hospital due to fear of stigma, consulting a doctor anonymously on oDoc is an option. \u201cTap a button and you can do it on an anonymous mode too but then you won\u2019t get a prescription. The system will not collect or store any of your details either,\u201d Dharmaraja explains.</p>\n<p>Currently, the doctor-patient ratio in Sri lanka is 1:1000 \u2013 quite similar to India. ODoc has roped in 25 doctors in Colombo, Kandy, and other main cities of the country.</p>\n<p>\u201cFor a product like oDoc, the easiest way to get more users is when they are at a doctor\u2019s clinic or at a pharmacy. We could get doctors to tell their patients to do the follow-up consultation over oDoc \u2013 as a tool of convenience as well as to save their time,\u201d says co-founder Inshard Naizer, who is also oDoc\u2019s chief growth officer.</p>\n<p>They are initially going after patients in Colombo. \u201cThen to all other cities of the country, and then other Commonwealth countries. Bangladesh and Maldives, for example, where geography is a barrier and medical care could be improved,\u201d Naizer says.</p>\n<p>The nascent Sri Lankan startup ecosystem would get a boost if startups like oDoc gain traction and catch the attention of investors from abroad. The Lankan government\u2019s Information and Communication Technology Agency has been holding an annual Disrupt Asia conference since last year to showcase what the island nation has to offer in tech innovation. But, as the saying goes, nothing succeeds like success on the ground.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Want to learn more about fundraising and how you can raise funding for your startup?

During <a href=\"http://switchsg.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Switch 2017</a>, Minister of Finance Heng Swee Keat announced two new initiatives for building the city-state\u2019s \u201ctechnopreneurial\u201d talent.</p>\n<p>First off, a nation-wide entrepreneurship training program called Lean LaunchPad will focus on helping research scientists and engineers learn about commercialization processes. The 10-week program is modeled after the US National Science Foundation\u2019s I-Corps program, as well as US universities\u2019 entrepreneurship programs.</p>\n<p>Topics tackled include technology translation, development of proofs of concept, licensing, and starting a company.</p>\n<p>The program is spearheaded by the National University of Singapore with offshoots into Nanyang Technological University, Singapore Management University, and the Singapore University of Technology and Design. It will be funded by the National Research Foundation (NRF) with US$6 million over the next five years.</p>\n<p>The aim is to train more than 1,000 participants and increase the number of technologies that go to market by more than 300 in five years. 22 teams have been selected for the program\u2019s first run, which started in August.</p>\n<p>\u201cBy pushing researchers to get out of the lab and talk to potential users and customers, they will better understand users\u2019 needs and think from customers\u2019 perspective,\u201d says professor Wong Poh Kam, director of NUS Entreprise and lead for the Lean LaunchPad program.</p>\n<p>Professor Wong had previously highlighted the need for effective translation of research to commercial applications during Innovfest Unbound in May, where he unveiled a <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/nus-enterprise-startup-study-singapore-2017\">study on the Singapore startup ecosystem</a> by NUS Enterprise.</p>\n<h2>Cross-pollination</h2>\n<p>The second initiative is Pollinate, an incubator that targets startups and university teams from Singapore\u2019s polytechnics. Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Singapore Polytechnic, and Temasek Polytechnic will collaborate on Pollinate to build up growth-stage startups with ideas ready for commercialization.</p>\n<p>The NRF will fund Pollinate with US$750,000 over the next three years. At the moment, there are 14 startups in Pollinate, with plans to grow to 30 in that time.</p>\n<p>Pollinate will offer these startups access to the polytechnics\u2019 students, alumni, and faculty, and help connect them to local and overseas industry partners. It will also get them to collaborate with small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) to address problems and encourage innovation in the SME sector.</p>\n<p><em>Converted from Singapore dollars.

Boy, did I get lucky. My benchmark for success was hitting a US$1,000 milestone. I hit that milestone in the\u00a0first week of launch. In the first month, our revenue was US$4,000; in the second, it shot to US$9,000; in the third, it was US$15,000. By the 18th month, we had made a total of US$1 million in revenue.</p>\n<p>Then, I took the Euro trip.</p>\n<p>What exactly happened during the trip? Not much on the business side: Wingify\u2019s growth was on autopilot, so I had all the time in the world to try Belgian beer, get lost in Shakespeare and Company, hike in Interlaken, and take Gondola rides. Beyond Europe, <a href=\"http://paraschopra.com/blog/personal/i-turned-30-and-heres-my-scorecard.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">I found time to travel to many other places</a>.

Kill it with all you\u2019ve got!\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>The reason I\u2019d say this is because VWO\u2019s growth rate paled in comparison to the\u00a0growth rate of the A/B testing industry.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_428065\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-428065\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/1U3HLoN-xIIyeHsekRD2Qig.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"760\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Google Trends from 2010 to 2017 for the \u201cA/B testing\u201d search\u00a0term.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Recently, I also came to know that one of our competitors, Optimizely, who started during the same time as VWO, has increased its annual recurring revenue (ARR) to <a href=\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/optimizely-surpasses-90-million-in-recurring-revenue-and-hires-jay-larson-as-ceo-to-grow-to-1-billion-and-beyond-300486404.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">US$90 million</a>\u00a0while VWO\u2019s annual run rate today is around US$15 million ARR. That\u2019s a big gap.</p>\n<p>Sure, <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/optimizely\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">they\u2019ve raised US$150 million</a>\u00a0in funding, which meant getting more tradeshows, big booths, salespeople, expensive and experienced leaders, conferences, etc. I won\u2019t go into the bootstrapping vs fundraising debate right now, but what\u2019s clear to me is that had I known there was a world where companies could grow faster than 75 percent year-on-year growth, I\u2019m sure I would have done a few things differently.</p>\n<p>I would have spent more effort and money in building a brand, focused on strategy, approached product from a switching costs perspective, and set ambitious goals for the company. But I\u2019m getting ahead of myself.</p>\n<h2><b>Startup complacency</b></h2>\n<p>While being happy with your startup is good, attaining growth is even more exciting. In reality, you don\u2019t have to choose between the two. You can be both happy in life and focused on growing.</p>\n<p>Startup complacency could strike typically after an initial success in any endeavor. That feeling of winning can easily become a this-is-my-limit-and-I\u2019m-happy-with-that mindset.</p>\n<p>Nothing\u2019s wrong with this, but the feeling of happiness limits your potential. Initial success means you\u2019ve unlocked something that nobody has seen so far and know something not many others know. Initial success is nothing but an initial proof of something much bigger. The real deal is in capitalizing that discovery and building it into something bigger.</p>\n<p>But, again, what\u2019s wrong with pausing a little bit and celebrating initial success?</p>\n<p><strong>Because it will slow you down</strong>. Once you stumble on a business oppurtunity, it becomes known to many others as well. While you\u2019re taking a breather, other people are preparing to make the most of that oppurtunity. Large companies start thinking if they should launch products in your market and new startups are thinking of pivoting into your market. The world of capitalism is ruthless and any discovered business oppurtunity doesn\u2019t remain unexploited for long. I know this because I saw all of this happen in the last seven years of running Wingify.</p>\n<h2><b>What if I do not want to grow my company beyond a certain scale?</b></h2>\n<p>I used to think the same. I was a Nihilist and would constantly ask myself, \u201cWhy grow at all?\u201d But I quickly understood that like life, <b>business resists stasis</b>. Either you are growing or shrinking; there\u2019s no staying the same. It\u2019s no problem if you\u2019re not motivated to grow your business. Your competitors are just going to crush you and take all your customers. Chasing growth is not optional in business.</p>\n<p>(Basecamp/37Signals is an exception because,\u00a0in spite of <a href=\"https://m.signalvnoise.com/enough-1d48019c7335\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">preaching to stay small</a>, <a href=\"https://artplusmarketing.com/why-you-should-take-everything-jason-fried-writes-with-a-pound-of-salt-5ccfb27b4e5\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">they\u2019re growing</a>. My suspicion is that talking about not growing helps them grow, as they appeal to small businesses with little intent to grow beyond their current setup.)</p>\n<h2><b>How do I know if I\u2019m not making the most of my initial startup success?<br></b></h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Look inside: Is your customer base growing every month?</li>\n<li>Look around: Are your competitors growing every month?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If both answers are yes, your industry is on fire and you can grow much faster and bigger than your current growth rate. If you have 100 customers, you can have 100 more. If your competitors add 500 new customers, many of those could have been yours. Know that as long as demand exists in the market and you are not capturing most of that demand, you are being complacent.</p>\n<h2><b>A positive loop<br></b></h2>\n<p>There was one thing I didn\u2019t know about being complacent: Growth is a positive feedback loop, and it makes everything easier. A growing company attracts great talent, and great talent helps your company grow faster. Customers flock to a growing company because that\u2019s what other customers do. Partners and vendors give better terms to a growing company because it gives them a higher status. The press pays more attention to growing companies because growth makes for great headlines. A growing company\u2019s brand is built faster, and that attracts even more customers.</p>\n<p>Everything becomes easier with growth. On the other hand, a shrinking or a flat company typically goes through a negative feedback loop. Did I tell you that growth is not optional in business?</p>\n<h2><b>Watch your company\u2019s culture</b></h2>\n<p>One of the first things to take a hit with growth is a company\u2019s culture. With a rapid revenue growth comes a lot of new employees in a short period of time. These new employees can easily overwhelm your existing company culture. Hiring outside leaders also comes with a risk of them introducing new ways of working, which can go both ways. What comes is confusion with what the company encourages and discourages. (<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/22/technology/uber-workplace-culture.html?mcubz=0\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Uber\u2019s culture</a> is an example of the toxic side effects of growth.)</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p><b>I\u2019m not proposing growth at all costs</b>. I\u2019m asking you to constantly rediscover your company\u2019s optimal growth rate, discovering the right tradeoff between the future upsides (more revenue and profits) and downsides (culture dilution, confused organization structure, bureaucracy, etc.) of growth.</p>\n<p><em>This article was first published on <a href=\"https://growth.wingify.com/startup-complacency-the-flip-side-of-startup-success-that-nobody-talks-about-586dc22dc8d0\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Medium</a>.</em></p>", "spider_name": "techinasia", "id": "techinasia_428040", "has_funding_news": 0.32523223757743835}

Photo credit: Redmart.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Redmart\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/redmart-patrick-teo-homecoming\">new top engineer and product person</a> cut his teeth in Silicon Valley, working for Amazon and Facebook. But before that, Patrick Teo was a founding member of a startup in the Valley \u2013 a photography publishing service called <a href=\"https://www.shutterfly.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Shutterfly</a>.</p>\n<p>That was 1999, the era of the \u201cdotcom boom\u201d in the US \u2013 and the peak before the plunge of the 2001 bust.</p>\n<p>\u201cDigital cameras were in vogue [then]. We thought, where do you get your photos printed with a digital camera?\u201d Teo tells <em>Tech in Asia</em>. The startup allowed users to have their digital images printed and later made into all kinds of physical products like greeting cards and calendars.</p>\n<p>Shutterfly made it through the 2001 crisis successfully, achieved profitability, and listed on NASDAQ in 2006.</p>\n<h2>Walking through the Valley</h2>\n<p>Teo went on to product and engineering positions at Amazon and Facebook. At chez Bezos, his mission was to build the company\u2019s new music streaming product. He started at Amazon in 2009, when digital music basically involved using iTunes to download files onto your iPod. Online streaming was still in its infancy but always-connected smartphones were coming into their own.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe project was, essentially, to take advantage of the connectivity of mobile to build a cloud-based streaming system,\u201d Teo says.</p>\n<p>Sounds pretty straightforward, but the challenge was not insignificant. The project was based in San Francisco, where Seattle-headquartered Amazon didn\u2019t have a large presence at the time.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">Teo sees tech like machine learning and artificial intelligence as an important part of Redmart\u2019s product.</blockquote>\n<p>\u201cOne of the major challenges of building Amazon\u2019s music service was hiring the large team that would build it. Amazon was competing against startups and other large tech companies for talent,\u201d Teo says. With the company\u2019s offices all the way up north in the state of Washington, the Bay Area-based team would have to coordinate with the mothership remotely.</p>\n<p>So the company decided to make this part of its brand to help recruitment. \u201cPeople who joined were able to have a larger impact and greater autonomy. Plus, they were able to build many new capabilities from the ground up using various AWS tools and technologies. This brand was used to recruit through industry hires, internal transfers, and universities,\u201d he explains.</p>\n<p>After spending four years there, Teo decided to look for new challenges. He found what he was looking for at Menlo Park, with Facebook\u2019s \u201cmove fast\u201d approach. Teams would try new ideas for six to 12 months, some of them involving major features, and then strike them down if they were not working and moving on. \u201cThere was constant experimentation,\u201d Teo says.</p>\n<p>For example, one of his teams once spent six months on a feature that helped users share their status update more easily. The feature rolled into several countries but it didn\u2019t make the impact the team hoped for, so it got scrapped.</p>\n<p>Facebook\u2019s \u201chacker culture\u201d also appealed to Teo. He recalls a meeting with a colleague who worked in business development when he first started at the social network. \u201cWhen we met, he looked tired and I learned it was because he had spent the night before in a hackathon team, hacking on some new iOS feature the team was passionate about,\u201d he relates.</p>\n<p>Teo was approached by Redmart through an informal introduction, which led to some casual back-and-forth. That was when he decided to take the plunge and return to the homeland.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_337812\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/redmart-team-photo.jpg\" alt=\"Redmart team photo\" width=\"950\" height=\"530\" class=\"size-full wp-image-337812\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Teo says that Redmart fits his customer-centric philosophy. Photo credit: Redmart.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>To serve the customers</h2>\n<p>Redmart appealed to him because of its customer-centric philosophy. Speaking to two of Redmart\u2019s three co-founders, Roger Egan and Vikram Rupani, Teo realized Redmart\u2019s culture would be a good fit for him and what he wanted to do.</p>\n<p>More than Amazon or Facebook, it was his time with Shutterfly that shaped Teo\u2019s mindset about serving customers. Having been part of that company for a decade, he maintains that developing the product around the end user was a constant that steered the team through struggles and challenges.</p>\n<p>Given that it\u2019s a common thread that brought him to Redmart, I ask him what \u201ccustomer-centric\u201d means to him.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">At Shutterfly, it was not uncommon to have all-nighters to provide the best possible service to their customers.</blockquote>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s about making decisions, both on the product and the tech, that put the customer first,\u201d he explains. When building a product, sometimes there are things that make the tech more efficient and save time and effort for developers, but will impact customer experience. \u201cWhen there\u2019s shortfalls in the technology and the product, always keep in mind that ultimately what you\u2019re trying to do is to create the best possible experience for customers,\u201d he adds.</p>\n<p>But it goes beyond that. At Shutterfly, for example, it was not uncommon to have all-nighters to be able to provide the best possible service to their customers. During the holiday season in the startup\u2019s early years, Teo remembers many employees volunteering for the 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. night shift when the company was short-handed and orders needed to be fulfilled.</p>\n<p>\u201cRegardless of our roles, we would be folding cards, putting postage stamps on envelopes, and packing orders in our manufacturing facility,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>In those days, the team had to take down their website in order to push software updates. So every month, these updates would take place at night. \u201cI remember many of us heading into the office on release day each month at around 10 p.m. to conduct our software release and leaving the office past midnight \u2013 and sometimes the next morning, if we ran into issues with our release,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>As Redmart\u2019s new chief product officer and executive VP of engineering, Teo feels it fits this philosophy well because of the very nature of its business \u2013 delivering groceries. \u201cGrocery shopping is by and large inconvenient, a chore. And you have to do it very frequently. My vision is to address this by making a product that is convenient. It\u2019s personalized so it knows what you like, how frequently you order, and when you like to receive your order.\u201d</p>\n<p>Like a lot of other startups for whom deep knowledge of their customer is key to their business, Teo sees tech like machine learning and artificial intelligence as an important part of Redmart\u2019s product. He demurs when asked about examples of products and features that could spring out of this.</p>\n<h2>The Singapore opportunity</h2>\n<p>Teo joins Redmart at a very busy time for the company.

Here\u2019s my conversation with him.</p>\n<h2><b>What is CanLaw?</b></h2>\n<p>CanLaw is a legal tech startup. Legal tech is similar to fintech and is focused on innovating the legal profession using technology.</p>\n<p>We started off with a lawyer discovery platform, where people could go online, put all their needs on the platform, compare quotes from lawyers, and then make bookings with them.</p>\n<p>We\u2019ve also moved on to doing different things like running an online legal news site called <a href=\"https://canlawreport.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">The CanLaw Report</a>, where we try to make the law and new legal developments fun, engaging, and shareable. How we do it is we put GIFs, memes, and those kinds of things to make it fun for people to understand.</p>\n<p>Recently, we are also doing workshops and consultancies for lawyers who want to adopt technologies as well. We are branching into that and seeing how we can move there.</p>\n<h2><b>After you graduated from the bar, why did you join a startup instead of pursuing a legal career?</b></h2>\n<p>Well, I think a lot of people know me as a student activist and human rights activist, but even earlier than that, I was also a tech geek.</p>\n<p>After finishing my legal studies, this opportunity came by from friends who were working on this startup. I like law and I love tech too, so I thought this was a great idea.</p>\n<p>I did some research as well on what legal tech startups are doing overseas. They are doing great things, changing the legal profession in places like the US, the UK, and Australia.</p>\n<p>By implementing technology, you do not just help lawyers upskill themselves but also help people access lawyers more easily. So, for me, it is still at the heart of what I am very passionate about, which is increasing access to justice and human rights.</p>\n<p>A lot of people we speak with just don\u2019t know where to find a lawyer. They ask their friends\u2019 friends, and that\u2019s pretty much it. They don\u2019t even know whether that lawyer is good or not.</p>\n<p>I feel that access to justice is still very low, not just in terms of accessing lawyers but also the knowledge required. That\u2019s why I run The CanLaw Report. I think the millennials are just turned off by legal articles, those boring shit. I want to make it fun and engaging. I don\u2019t want to just follow the system.</p>\n<h2><b>What does it mean to be an ambassador of buzz and what is your growth strategy?</b></h2>\n<p>My job is a lot about making people know what CanLaw is in a viral and fun way. Basically, it\u2019s a fancy name for marketing and communications.</p>\n<p>I think content marketing is really big nowadays. From what I read, people are less responsive to ads. That\u2019s why people have ad blockers and that kind of stuff. Now, they\u2019re more interested in reading things like \u201c3 things you did not know about your tenancy agreement that might screw you up\u201d\u2014that kind of thing. Or \u201cWhat happened to the Chatime situation?\u201d</p>\n<p>That\u2019s how we make people know about what CanLaw is. For me, the past 10 months have been successful in a way.</p>\n<h2><b>You guys are still young. Why do you think you\u2019re the right people to lead the change in the space?</b></h2>\n<p>I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a movement. We try. To me anyways\u2014I don\u2019t think I can speak for them\u2014I think it\u2019s not something that everyone will want to do, especially in this climate with more conservative people in the legal profession. I think it\u2019s the passion that you want to see it happen and you will try while you can and see what you can do. It\u2019s about keeping the goal and making sure that you somehow get there.</p>\n<p>I really feel that there is a need for more access to the total justice system. There\u2019s so much potential in the legal profession; there are so many new lawyers coming up, new ways people are doing law, and new ways that people give access to justice to the people. But there needs to be a certain change in the regulations. For me, I\u2019m happy to be part of this change.</p>\n<h2><b>What was the turning point for you that confirmed your interest in the startup?</b></h2>\n<p>When I started for the first few months, I joined this thing called the Maxis Inspire Challenge. That was probably my first time getting involved with a startup competition. It was my first time meeting startup people, networking with them, talking about my ideas, and pitching. So that was weird. Somehow we won that, and it was pretty awesome.</p>\n<p>For me, this type of thing is actually something that I feel that I can do and would be interested in doing\u2014to spread the idea of what we plan to do at CanLaw and our dreams and ideas.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s really my turning point when I realized that I wanted to do this.</p>\n<h2><b>Where do you see yourself in five years?</b></h2>\n<p>At the moment, I can only see how it looks like from others. My two other co-founders, Edwin and Soon Yi, just had their babies; Soon Yi might have his baby within the week. I can really see how he\u2019s juggling it. Whether I can do that or not is a separate thing, but I think within five years, I still see myself here.</p>\n<p>I am going to try to do what we can to make a difference while staying afloat as a company, of course. If nothing goes wrong, I will still be here.</p>\n<h2><b>Does being a millennial help you in starting up?</b></h2>\n<p>I don\u2019t know whether being a millennial is an advantage. I don\u2019t take instruction very well. I always ask why before doing anything. I will be like, \u201cI don\u2019t know why we are doing this. Don\u2019t just tell me what to do, tell me why you are doing it, and l will figure out a better way to do it.\u201d</p>\n<p>I always want to take ownership of what I want to do, and I guess it helps them as well because it pushes them to think it over again. We develop together because I don\u2019t just do this and do that, so it pushes the team along the way. I think that helps.</p>\n<h2><b>What advice would you give for millennials who would like to start up?</b></h2>\n<p>I think the typical thing would be to say, \u201cJust go for it,\u201d but I think what I would say is \u201cthink about it properly first.\u201d You don\u2019t want to be a burden to your family or to your girlfriend or boyfriend, so you need to make sure that you think about it pragmatically first.</p>\n<p>How long do you want to do it? How long are you going to support it? Is it practical? Once all those are sorted out, just go for it.</p>\n<p>I think I wouldn\u2019t be an advocate of the mindset of just screwing all this and going for it. Just think about it first.</p>\n<h2><b>What would you do if you could create a global law?</b></h2>\n<p>Since this covers everyone, we need to solve the smallest and most basic and fundamental problems. I think, for me, the biggest problem in the world now is inequality. There are so many people who have no full access to water, education, and justice. Not everyone is born equal, so there needs to be laws to put everyone on an equal platform.</p>\n<p>For me, I think there needs to be a law\u2014if it is enforceable\u2014that everyone needs to have the right to education. So, every kid needs to at least graduate university or maybe even just high school, for example. That would really solve most other problems.</p>\n<p>Watch the full video of the conversation here:</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5XE9pr6hjEQ\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>", "spider_name": "techinasia", "id": "techinasia_427750", "has_funding_news": 0.4846056401729584}

Photo credit: CashShield.</p>\n</div>\n<p>When Justin Lie approached clients in 2011 with his cyber security solution, he faced raised eyebrows and quizzical looks. Back then, the concept of automation using machine learning had nowhere near the draw it has today. Fast-forward to 2017 and his startup <a href=\"http://www.cashshield.com/\" target=\"_blank\">CashShield</a> has clients all over the world, with three international offices and a fourth on the way \u2013 plus it\u2019s profitable and growing rapidly.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">At the time, machine learning sounded ridiculous.</blockquote>\n<p>The Singapore-based company started out as CashRun in the late 2000s, after co-founder and CEO Lie\u2019s own websites were hit by credit card fraud. Even as a teen, Lie had been making websites to sell items on eBay. Coming face to face with the problem of fraudulent transactions, he thought of an automated way to track down and flag illicit behavior.</p>\n<p>Lie successfully tested the initial product with a gaming company in Germany. Then it was time for the hard part: develop and refine the technology, and convince clients of its value.</p>\n<p>\u201cImagine pitching to clients that machine learning was going to solve all their problems and they would no longer need humans to look at transactions manually. At the time it sounded ridiculous,\u201d he tells <em>Tech in Asia</em>.</p>\n<h2>Digital guardian</h2>\n<p>CashShield uses machine learning to track user behavior patterns on websites that involve financial transactions, like ecommerce stores. The startup has developed its own software from scratch with real-time pattern recognition and passive biometric analytics capabilities (where the subject doesn\u2019t know the identification process is happening).</p>\n<p>These impressive-sounding phrases mean the system can detect patterns in, for example, mouse movements and typing speed or in devices being used, in order to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent users.</p>\n<p>If such behavior is detected, the system rejects the transaction automatically, with no need for human input.</p>\n<p>The data it gathers helps protect clients from payment fraud, fake account creation, account takeovers, and promo abuse (when fraudsters create new accounts in bulk to exploit sign-up incentives). The startup is so confident in its automated system\u2019s effectiveness that it offers a 100-percent chargeback guarantee in case of failure \u2013 meaning it will reimburse its clients for fraudulent transactions that break through its defenses.</p>\n<p>It took CashShield five years to research and refine its tech, but the time spent helped cement the company\u2019s competitive advantage. \u201cIf you look at a lot of AI or machine learning tools, they are usually built around a common framework,\u201d Lie says. \u201cSo a lot of solutions end up looking pretty alike.\u201d</p>\n<p>The startup has been rewarded for its efforts with big-name clients all over the world, which allowed it to secure \u201cbillions in gross merchandise volume\u201d and become profitable very quickly. The list includes companies like Razer, Alibaba, Square Enix, T-Mobile, and Vodafone. It opened offices in Berlin, Jakarta, and Shanghai, funding operations largely out of its own pocket.</p>\n<p>While Lie doesn\u2019t reveal specific figures, he says CashShield has been seeing a 200-percent growth rate in revenue every year and has increased the contracts it has signed by 1000 percent in the past 12 months.</p>\n<p>Until recently it has been able to forge ahead without worrying about external funding, meaning  it could be picky when it came to external investors. More than funds, it needed go-to-market expertise and strategic partners that could help it grow further.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_427489\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/cashshield-team-at-work.jpeg\" alt=\"CashShield team at work.\" width=\"950\" height=\"534\" class=\"size-full wp-image-427489\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">CashShield team members, including co-founder Junxian Lee (R) hard at work.

It may not look like a unicorn story but I think this is how most businesses are built.</p>\n<p>Nowadays, especially in India, startups are fashionable. Everyone is a CxO in their social media profiles. There is nothing wrong with that, but it was a little harder when we started back in 2009-2010, right after college.\u00a0I see a lot of talk about funding, innovation, quick exits, and getting rich. Trust me, it\u2019s not real.</p>\n<h2>Survival is the real innovation</h2>\n<p>When we started our business with almost no money, it was very hard to survive. We were not thinking of getting rich, earning millions of dollars in revenue, having a big team, or having cool infrastructure. Our main concern was how we would survive the next day, week, or month. Even basic things like food or computers were also the part of the story. Let me share a couple of such incidents.</p>\n<h3>Food survival</h3>\n<p>My co-founder and I were constantly working way too hard, but as you know, nothing happens overnight. Our savings were also depleting quickly. So one day during a discussion, we thought, how will we survive if we\u2019re unable to generate some profits? Even food was going to be a problem for us.</p>\n<p>So we decided that if we weren\u2019t able to generate profits, we would start eating Maggi,\u00a0which cost US$0.16\u00a0at that time, meaning US$0.32 per day and US$9.36 per month. The situation improved in the coming weeks, but if it didn\u2019t, we were determined to face it.</p>\n<h3>Infrastructure\u00a0survival</h3>\n<p>At the time, we had no infrastructure. We were just living in a small room with no power backups, and for us \u201cinfrastructure\u201d meant the computers we had. As things got started, we hired an intern\u00a0from a nearby college, but as we didn\u2019t have any extra systems, it was super hard to explain things and deploy him to work. So\u00a0I used to sleep during the day so that the intern can use my PC, and then I would work at night. That was how we increased productivity and team size despite limited resources.</p>\n<p>Why am I telling such personal stories to all of you? Because this may happen. Whenever you start your startup journey, your honeymoon is over. We managed to survive, and that\u2019s what I consider to be real innovation.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_427465\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-427465\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Webkul-Team.png\" alt=\"Webkul Team\" width=\"851\" height=\"315\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Webkul team.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Slow is good</h2>\n<p>Yes it is. Almost every other startup have taglines like \u201cfastest-growing startup\u201d (even we have in the past). But to be honest, we really got to where we are by going slow and organic. We were first-time entrepreneurs and everything was very new to us, so even if we had the funds, it was hard to use it.</p>\n<p>By going slow and organic, we learned a lot of things that we would never have if we raised funds and grew super fast. You may ask, what\u2019s wrong with that? Aren\u2019t a lot of startups doing that?</p>\n<p>Well, there is nothing wrong with that. But I truly believe that every company and startup has their own story.\u00a0You shouldn\u2019t start your startup to be just any other company; I really think about creating an impact. That\u2019s why we left our well-established jobs and went on our own which, trust me, was very hard at that moment.</p>\n<p>So here\u2019s why slow is good. If we had funds and resources at that time, for sure we would have taken the most proven paths at every step. Until now, we have spent not even a single penny on advertisements; all of our advertisements are organic. In this way, we have learned so many things which was almost impossible if we had taken the usual proven paths.</p>\n<p>Going slow doesn\u2019t mean executing slow; going slow means you must execute fast in what you are really good at.</p>\n<h2>You can\u2019t disrupt without profit</h2>\n<p>We realized this at the very early stage of our business, thanks to our bootstrap nature. Most of the unicorns nowadays don\u2019t generate profit and that\u2019s a real problem.</p>\n<p>In business, nothing is permanent and things change quickly. For example, your interns will eventually graduate, and they will receive offers from other companies. Even if everything is going right at your startup, you can\u2019t ask them to stay without paying them.</p>\n<p>We were really concerned about generating profit as we truly believe <strong>people get potential and expertise by practice only</strong>\u00a0and after spending a good amount of time at it, we learned more and became better.</p>\n<h2>Tech is our core</h2>\n<p>You must focus on your business; it matters a lot. Many tech companies fail and the reason is simple: although they are so-called tech companies with technical founders, many eventually focus more on sales rather than the product. They focus on the things which actually doesn\u2019t matter in business.</p>\n<p>We never follow such trends. From day one, we always focused on our core business and our core technology, especially since our line of business requires a significant amount of technology. That\u2019s how after seven years of constant building, the company is where it is today.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_427464\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-427464\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Webkul-Team-at-Deloitte-Awards.jpg\" alt=\"Webkul Team at Deloitte Awards\" width=\"960\" height=\"640\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Webkul team winning an award from Deloitte.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Growth requires a good amount of time</h2>\n<p>There are very few companies in the world which can get profitable growth in very little time. We have seen constant growth in our business but it didn\u2019t happen overnight. We never thought of getting featured at the big news sites or getting listed in big business magazines. We were very sure that such things will happen automatically if our work and business grew.</p>\n<p>But the reverse is not true. Getting listed and receiving awards may give you positive vibes, but it is not the goal. Your true award is when you can bring profits to your customer\u2019s business; if you can do that, for sure you will have positive growth.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the people within your company must benefit both financially and technically. It does not mean having cool infrastructure or loads of parties. You must invest a good amount of time to enrich them.</p>\n<p>We constantly work on improving our company. And we\u2019re thankful to our team and customers who trusted us when we were nothing. Bootstrap and proud.</p>\n<p><em>Converted from Indian rupee.

Photo credit: Tech in Asia.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Masayoshi Son is a familiar figure in India, with billions of dollars invested in Flipkart, Ola, and Oyo. Now his younger brother Taizo is on his first visit to India, but this Japanese investor has set his sights far away from ecommerce and transportation. He wants to invest in food and agritech startups.</p>\n<p>Today in Bangalore, he announced the setting up of a new entity called Gastrotope in partnership with GSF accelerator. It will incubate and invest in startups innovating at both ends of the food cycle: technologies to upgrade farming as well as more efficient and less wasteful consumption of food.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">Taizo Son invests in startups from his personal wealth and does not face some constraints of VCs.</blockquote>\n<p>In a chat with <em>Tech in Asia</em>, Taizo Son said the typical time-bound venture capital or accelerator model is ill-suited for tackling some of the world\u2019s big issues. He feels more intelligent farming, as well as distribution and consumption of food, with the use of new tech like AI, IoT, and robotics can be transformative.</p>\n<p>The Japanese serial entrepreneur and investor, who recently <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/taizo-son-startup\">shifted his base to Singapore</a>, wants to approach innovation in this area in a more holistic and long-term way than VC-funded startups are able to do in their drive to scale up fast. Taizo Son invests in startups from his personal wealth and does not face some of those constraints.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe KPIs (key performance indicators) of startups in the Gastrotope program will be related to the strength of their products and the value they bring,\u201d he told <em>Tech in Asia</em>. The incubation program will typically be a year long, and international startups will also be invited.</p>\n<p>It won\u2019t be just about funding either.

In that perspective, be sure to check each VC firm for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b> The stage they invest in (seed, series A, B, or C)</b>:\u00a0The first thing to check is whether a fund invests in companies at your stage. If you\u2019re an early-stage company looking for a seed round, there is no need to contact funds investing in series B and more. You can usually find this information on their website.</li>\n<li>\n<b> Their investment scope</b>:<b>\u00a0</b>The majority of VC firms limit their investments to specific types of companies and geographies. At Point Nine, for example, we only invest in SaaS and marketplaces and don\u2019t invest in social or gaming apps. We also mostly focus on Europe and North America, even if we have some exceptions. Before contacting a VC, you need to check whether you fit their scope or not.</li>\n<li>\n<b> Their investment thesis</b>: Most VCs have what they call an investment thesis, which details precisely what they\u2019re looking for. These could be the characteristics of the founding teams they like to back, the technologies they find exciting, the markets they think are promising, and so on. This document is the hardest to find, as it\u2019s not often accessible on their website. <a href=\"https://www.usv.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">USV</a> is an excellent example of a thesis-driven\u00a0fund.</li>\n<li>\n<b> Their support and added value</b>: If you\u2019ve concluded in part one that a particular added value will be critical to your success, you need to find the investors who offer that. It\u2019s key when you operate in specific industries or verticals, as industry-focused VCs can help tremendously. For example, funds specializing in healthcare tech or government tech can provide operational support, a network, and knowledge that non-specialized firms can\u2019t.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><b>Where do I find a list of VCs?</b></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b> Network</b>: First, ask fellow founders in your city. If they\u2019ve already raised, it\u2019s very likely that they have such a list.</li>\n<li>\n<b> Incubators and accelerators</b>: If you\u2019re part of an incubator, don\u2019t forget to ask them for a list of investors. If they don\u2019t have one, it\u2019s a huge warning.</li>\n<li>\n<b> A Google search</b>: This is a simple but effective method. Just Google \u201cVC in [your area]\u201d and you\u2019ll probably find a spreadsheet created by a local investor or a founder. This is what I found by Googling \u201c<a href=\"https://blog.serenacapital.com/the-ultimate-french-vc-list-64034164b081\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">VC in Paris</a>\u201d or \u201c<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1khvSN2pcnsc7O5dr9mq8TwJv0h_zJJYLzhiZZ_KDmfM/edit#gid=1550181509\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">VC in New York</a>.\u201d</li>\n<li>\n<b> Startup directories</b>: Whether it\u2019s on <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Crunchbase</a>, <a href=\"https://angel.co/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">AngelList</a>, Dealroom, or other directories, you can find a list of VCs here and can even filter them by geography.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><b>How do I understand an investment scope and thesis?</b></h3>\n<p>The first thing to do is to check the firm\u2019s website. In most cases, you\u2019ll be able to understand their investment scope: stage, types of companies, and geographies they invest in.</p>\n<p>Their investment thesis can be trickier to find. If you\u2019re lucky, they\u2019ll have shared it on their website. If they didn\u2019t, you can check:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b> Their blogs</b>: Reading what investors write on their blogs is the best way to have a good idea of their investment thesis. Some of them even publish the whole thing, like how they did it <a href=\"https://medium.com/@2lr/series-a-my-investment-thesis-211c988e5545\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://www.usv.com/blog/investment-thesis-usv\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</li>\n<li>\n<b> Their latest investments</b>: By checking the latest investments of a VC firm on Crunchbase, you can also get a rough idea of the trends they follow and the types of companies they like to back.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><b>Should I always value prestigious VCs over smaller ones?</b></h3>\n<p>Christoph Janz, one of our managing partners, wrote a post\u00a0titled \u201c<a href=\"http://christophjanz.blogspot.com/2016/09/should-you-take-small-checks-from-deep.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Should I take small checks from deep pockets?</a>\u201d about this question.</p>\n<h2><b>Do your first light reference checks</b></h2>\n<p>Like in any industry, you have <a href=\"http://christophjanz.blogspot.de/2014/11/good-vcs-bad-vcs.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bad and good VCs</a>. Good VCs can be a huge part of your success and bad ones can kill your business. This is why it\u2019s important to do reference checks at this stage.</p>\n<p>When shortlisting VCs, try to collect the opinions of those who have worked with them:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b> Other founders</b>: Whether it\u2019s founders from their portfolio or those who\u2019ve tried to raise with them, don\u2019t hesitate to ask for opinions during an event or through your network. Ask people what it\u2019s like to work with the firm, how the fundraising process went, if they would recommend working with the firm, and if the firm is known for harming startups.</li>\n<li>\n<b> Business angels</b>: If you have business angels, don\u2019t forget to ask for their opinions too.</li>\n<li>\n<b> Incubators and accelerators</b>: They should be able to give you some feedback based on the experiences of other incubated projects. Many accelerators and incubators have a private ranking of the VCs they\u2019ve worked with.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At this stage, it\u2019s probably not worth doing deep reference checks (which we\u2019ll cover in part four), but you should at least be aware of the reputation of the different funds you\u2019ll approach. <b>Don\u2019t skip this phase</b>.</p>\n<h2><b>Creating your fundraising material</b></h2>\n<p>Before contacting the first batch of VCs, you need to create your pitch deck. I won\u2019t explain the art of pitch deck creation, as almost every fund shares a template.</p>\n<p>If I had to give only two pieces of advice, the first one would be to create a deck that explains enough so that your readers understand what you\u2019re doing but not too much to keep\u00a0them curious and excited to learn more.</p>\n<p>When pitching or selling, we very often feel the urge to explain everything because we think it\u2019ll be easier to convince someone if they understand everything directly. But the primary goal of a pitch deck is not to share what your company does or will do. Rather, it is to urge the VC to get back to you because they\u2019ve become curious or excited. It sounds simple, but it\u2019s tough to find the right balance and to refrain from sharing too much.</p>\n<p>The second advice is directly related to the investor\u2019s investment thesis that we covered earlier. The better you understand a VC\u2019s investment thesis, the better you can highlight your corresponding strengths in your deck. Don\u2019t lie or oversell, but if you can create a pitch deck that is in line with an investment thesis, you\u2019ll probably have a bigger chance in generating interest and moving to the next phase.</p>\n<p>A deck is enough for this first step. If you manage to go to the next phase, you\u2019ll probably be asked for more documents, such as a financial plan and your product metrics.</p>\n<h2><b>Contacting your first\u00a0VCs</b></h2>\n<p>We\u2019re now finally ready to contact the VCs we\u2019ve shortlisted. How do we do that?</p>\n<p>The best way to get in touch with a VC is with a warm introduction. If you know someone who can introduce you, don\u2019t think twice. Obviously, the warmer the introduction, the better. However, some well-known funds only accept requests from their network, so they won\u2019t answer cold requests.</p>\n<h3><b>What if I don\u2019t have a warm introduction?</b></h3>\n<p>The first thing to do when you don\u2019t have a warm introduction is to go to the website of the investor and check their recommended procedure.</p>\n<p>You\u2019ll very often find instructions on how to send your deck there. It might not sound very fancy, but if they wrote it somewhere, it means that it probably makes their life easier, and you want to make their life easier.</p>\n<p>In our case, we request founders to fill a form that allows us to input all the relevant information directly into our deal flow tool.</p>\n<p>If there\u2019s no information on the investor\u2019s website or if you really want to contact someone directly, here\u2019s the procedure to follow.</p>\n<p><strong>Who should I contact?</strong></p>\n<p>There\u2019s no rule on how a fund is structured. Some funds will have several partners and almost no analysts or associates while others will have both. You\u2019ll find this information directly on the firm\u2019s team page or by searching on LinkedIn.</p>\n<p>For very small funds, targeting partners directly might make sense. But in most cases, cold contacting them is not the best strategy for several reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Partners usually don\u2019t manage the deal flow anymore. It\u2019s the analysts, associates, and principals who are in charge of that.</li>\n<li>They often get a ton of requests, so your chances to get an answer are slim.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, if you are really in cold contacting mode, reaching out to the analysts, associates, or principals might be the best option.</p>\n<p><b>How?</b></p>\n<p>Again it\u2019s all about being relevant. You need to understand what the investor\u2019s area of expertise and interests are. You can learn these through their website bio, social media accounts, or the content they produce. If your project fits their interests, you can contact them directly by email, social media, or during events. A simple email with your deck will be enough.</p>\n<p>The drawback of cold contacting a VC is that you can\u2019t blame them if you don\u2019t get an answer. If you follow the instructions on their website and don\u2019t get an answer, you can legitimately ask them what\u2019s the current status and why they haven\u2019t answered you.</p>\n<p>To summarize, the best way to get in touch with a VC is (by order of efficiency):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>With a warm intro</li>\n<li>By following the instructions on their website</li>\n<li>By cold contacting relevant ones</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>This article was first published on the author\u2019s <a href=\"https://medium.com/point-nine-news/an-early-stage-founders-guide-to-working-with-vcs-preparing-your-fundraising-d8fa6ed536f3\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Medium page</a>.</em></p>", "spider_name": "techinasia", "id": "techinasia_427203", "has_funding_news": 0.4417429268360138}

This is the key finding in a new report based on a survey of 579 accelerator programs that invested US$207 million into 11,305 startups in 2016. Out of this, about US$18 million went into 1,368 startups from 76 accelerator programs in the Asia Pacific region, according to an annual Gust report released today.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">Only 7 percent of APAC accelerators reported revenue from exits as their main source of revenue in 2016.</blockquote>\n<p>In 2015, nearly two-thirds of the accelerators surveyed (63 percent) were following the traditional cash-for-equity model. This involves investing a small amount of seed money \u2013 US$25,000 on average \u2013 in exchange for equity, usually between five percent and ten percent.</p>\n<p>Last year, the share of accelerators relying on returns from equity investments became less than half \u2013 42 percent. The reason is that exits are too few and taking too long to fund the operations of accelerators. Only 7 percent of APAC accelerators reported revenue from exits as their main source of revenue in 2016 \u2013 14 exits were reported by 11 accelerators.</p>\n<h3>Sources of revenue for accelerators in 2016</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_427215\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n<img src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Revenue-for-accelerators-in-2016.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"944\" height=\"745\" class=\"size-full wp-image-427215\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: Gust Report on Accelerators 2016.</p>\n</div>\n<p>This is in line with a global trend, with only 179 exits reported from the 579 accelerators surveyed.

This is perfectly fine. After all, it\u2019s better for a founder to be an expert in their field rather than in venture capital.</p>\n<p>This guide is intended for founders who plan to raise their first round with \u201cinstitutional\u201d VCs (aka VC firms, not business angels). I\u2019ll try to answer the question of \u201cWhat does it mean to work with VCs?\u201d by describing the different interactions you\u2019ll have with investors throughout the whole process:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b> Part 1</b>: Before working with VCs</li>\n<li>\n<b> Part 2</b>: Preparation and introduction</li>\n<li>\n<b> Part 3</b>: First contact and assessment phase</li>\n<li>\n<b> Part 4</b>: From term sheet to signed deal</li>\n<li>\n<b> Part 5</b>: Post-investment</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This guide is not a technical guide that will teach you how to create a pitch deck or how to read a term sheet. There are plenty of great posts already covering these aspects, some of which are linked in this guide. I\u2019ll focus more on describing the <strong>interactions that you\u2019ll have with VCs</strong> during this journey.</p>\n<p>This is also just a framework. Your own particular experience with VCs will depend on a myriad of factors, such as who you are interacting with, the structure of the deal, the industry you\u2019re operating in, your location, how \u201chot\u201d your company is, and many other factors.</p>\n<h2><b>The 2-minute video\u00a0TL;DR</b></h2>\n<p align=\"center\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/B-rLdLxaNHY\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Before starting your fundraising process, it\u2019s important to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Understand how the VC model works</li>\n<li>Define the most important values that you expect from VCs: money, mentorship, branding, and a network</li>\n<li>Think whether the VC model is aligned with your aspirations as an entrepreneur or not</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><b>How does the VC model\u00a0work?</b></h2>\n<p>Why do VC firms invest money in startups? To get a return on investment.</p>\n<p>Most VCs you probably know are middlemen. They raise money from various sources (sovereign funds, foundations, family offices, large corporations, etc.), which are called limited partners (LPs), to invest in startups they believe can grow enough to provide a healthy return on investment. They invest x amount of money to acquire y percent of a startup. If the startup grows, its value increases, and as a consequence, the initial investment also increases.</p>\n<p>The VC firm gets its cash once an exit happens. This means that the startup is either acquired by another company or goes public. Then, the VC firm splits the earnings between their LPs and themselves.</p>\n<h3>The goal of VC firms</h3>\n<p>Some firms invest their own money. This is the case with family offices or corporate funds (e.g. Google Ventures). This is an important aspect to keep in mind because it clues you in on what their incentives are.</p>\n<p>The primary goal of \u201cmiddlemen VCs\u201d is to invest in companies which have the potential to provide a significant return on investment. That way, they make their LPs happy and raise more money to invest in more startups.</p>\n<p>For firms which invest their own money, the incentives are a bit different. For instance, Salesforce Ventures or Google Ventures have other goals, such as making strategic investments to get access to new markets, exploring tech trends, helping startups grow their ecosystem, or acquiring them later.</p>\n<p>When you start fundraising, it\u2019s important to understand the firm\u2019s aims/incentives because it will impact your relationship with them in the long term. Always be aware that they don\u2019t give away money just for the sake of it but because they have their own goals too.</p>\n<p>If you want to dig deeper on this topic, here are some great posts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/01/the-meeting-that-showed-me-the-truth-about-vcs/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">The maths behind a VC fund</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://reactionwheel.net/2015/06/power-laws-in-venture.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Power law in venture</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://medium.com/@Samirkaji/micro-vc-smaller-is-better-but-the-math-is-still-really-hard-c0cd4f62ccc2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Micro-VC \u2014 Smaller is better, but the math is still really hard</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.eif.org/news_centre/publications/eif_wp_41.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">The European venture capital landscape: an EIF perspective</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>VC firm organizational chart</h3>\n<p>The second aspect which is useful to understand before fundraising is how a fund structures its organizational chart.</p>\n<p>Job titles in VC firms are very complicated (and quite funny). There are so many variations that it\u2019s impossible to list them all, and the same job title might cover different responsibilities from one firm to the other. To be honest, after two years working on the VC side, I gave up trying to understand it.</p>\n<p>The simplest way to picture the investment team is to distinguish between two hierarchies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>People who have the power to make an investment decision: these are generally those in the partner level (partner, senior partner, managing partner, founding partner, etc.).</li>\n<li>People who don\u2019t have this power and need to convince the ones who have it: these are the analysts, associates, principals, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is an important aspect to understand, especially during the first contact phase that we\u2019ll cover in more detail in part three.</p>\n<h2><b>What value should I expect from\u00a0VCs?</b></h2>\n<p>Another important question that you should ask yourself before raising your first round with an institutional VC is: \u201cWhat values do you expect beyond money?\u201d</p>\n<p>Obviously, the main aim of fundraising is to get money to grow your business. But what makes a great VC firm is not only the money it brings but also the value it can add:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b> Expertise/knowledge</b>: Have they invested in many great companies and could give you unique insights? Are they a specialized fund with industry-specific knowledge?</li>\n<li>\n<b> Network/mentorship</b>: VCs can grant you access to a network of founders, big corporations, or other investors that might be critical to your success.</li>\n<li>\n<b> Operational support</b>: More and more, VC firms offer operational support through HR, marketing, or design in resident teams or through a network of advisors.</li>\n<li>\n<b> Branding</b>: Being backed by a firm with a great brand can open a lot of doors.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These four aspects are crucial because these are what differentiates top VCs from the rest.</p>\n<p>Defining what\u2019s important depends on your particular situation and is worth thinking about. Depending on the business category or vertical you operate in, the choice of your investor (beyond money) is a strategic one.</p>\n<p>Nowadays, every single VC firm touts that they add value. By setting up your expectations before raising money, it\u2019ll be easier to assess whether a VC is bullshitting you or not when you do your due diligence on them.</p>\n<p>If you want to dig deeper on this topic, here are some great posts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://labs.openviewpartners.com/truth-vc-value-add/#.WXCvANOGPVo\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">The truth about VC value-add</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://avc.com/2017/05/investor-vcs-and-operator-vcs/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Investor VCs and Operator VCs</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://christophjanz.blogspot.com/2016/09/should-you-take-small-checks-from-deep.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Should you take small checks from deep pockets?</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><b>Is the VC model aligned with my aspirations as an entrepreneur?</b></h2>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve understood the two aspects above, it\u2019s important to check whether the VC model is aligned with your aspirations as an entrepreneur. When you commit to the VC way, it\u2019s almost impossible to go back. According to Steve Blank, \u201cThe minute you take money from someone, their business model now becomes yours.\u201d</p>\n<p>The VC model is not evil, but if it\u2019s not aligned with your personal beliefs and if you haven\u2019t made an effort to understand it, things can go horribly wrong. Avoid going the VC-backed way if you don\u2019t believe in it. Don\u2019t do it just for the money. (I\u2019ve written <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/talk/rise-vc-compatible-saas-companies\" rel=\"nofollow\">a post</a> covering this topic in more detail.)</p>\n<p>If you value control over speed, then you should consider other financing options. If you want to grow as fast as possible, the VC option is probably the best one.</p>\n<h2><b>Main takeaways</b></h2>\n<p>Before fundraising:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Try to understand how the VC model works and its implications when growing your business.</li>\n<li>Set your expectations regarding VC value-add before you raise.</li>\n<li>Thoroughly think about whether building a VC-backed company fits your aspirations as an entrepreneur. If not, don\u2019t follow that path.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>This article was first published on the author\u2019s <a href=\"https://medium.com/point-nine-news/an-early-stage-founders-guide-to-working-with-vcs-part-1-9a86c34e642\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Medium page</a>.</em></p>", "spider_name": "techinasia", "id": "techinasia_426831", "has_funding_news": 0.611578643321991}
