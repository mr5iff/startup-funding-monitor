This is what became the fun and the focus of the team,\u201d Zampella said. \u201cIt\u2019s a new, emerging mode. For us, it\u2019s about mixing it up. We try to never do the same thing too many times in a row. This was about, how do we as a team and a company grow? This was something that resonated so well that it had to be the focus of what we do. We needed to get this out.\u201d", "Mackey McCandlish", ", design director, said in an interview the team began before Titanfall 2 shipped in the fall of 2016. They prototyped early games and decided whether they were fun or not. In early 2017, PUBG exploded and Respawn paid attention. It was working on other games at the time \u2014 including Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, a title that is expected to be launched next month. To the dismay of fans, Respawn even decided to postpone Titanfall 3 in favor of Apex Legends, though Zampella noted that no one should make assumptions about whether Respawn has had to make tough tradeoffs.", "As the team kept going, it committed the sacrilege of jettisoning Titans. That was harsh, considering the game takes place in the Titanfall universe. Titans, which are giant mech suits piloted by humans, are beloved by fans of the franchise. The Titans can do enormous damage in the Titanfall games, but the Apex Legends team couldn\u2019t figure out how to make battle royale matches with Titans fair. After all, if one player gets into a Titan in such a match, he or she could lay waste to everyone else.", "One by one, the assumptions about how to do a battle royale game were tested. If they were fun, the conventions stayed in the game. If they weren\u2019t, then they got booted. There was, for instance, no point in gathering everyone in a pre-game arena before the match, as they only delayed the launch of a relatively short game. They got rid of the 100-player roster, falling upon 60 as a more manageable yet sizable number. They went with a smaller, more densely packed map. Teams consisted of three players, instead of four.", "They also added communications mechanics that allowed players to signal the finding and precise location of cool loot without having to say so using the microphone. You could use the same kind of communication to indicate the location of an enemy you spotted. Players were also encouraged to stick together, revive injured players, and even bring fallen comrades back from the dead.", "\u201cIt\u2019s a young genre. It has conventions,\u201d McCandlish said. \u201cBut since it\u2019s a young genre, you have to look at each convention from first principles and say, \u2018Is that just because it happened to be that way? Or is that the best way?'\u201d", "Above: Dean Takahashi pumps lead into someone who is already dead, as his partners have enabled him to win an Apex Legends round.", "I\u2019ve chased the fun myself, sticking with Apex Legends even as other big titles like EA/BioWare\u2019s Anthem and 4A\u2019s Metro Exodus games came out. All three of the games have small problems with bugs that have been annoying, and I hit a major one that stalled my progress in the PC version of Metro Exodus. So I\u2019ve been playing Apex Legends exclusively, trying to get better at the game. One day, I\u2019ll return to those other games, hopefully.", "That\u2019s hard for me, as anyone with knowledge of my game skills can tell you.

It runs smoothly, but the game still crashes now and then. I found that my mouse and keyboard skill had atrophied quite a bit. I would shoot well if I was standing still. Or move well if I wasn\u2019t shooting. But I had trouble doing both, and I was getting eviscerated in gun battles as I moved in predictable ways. I went six days without a kill at the start. But then I switched to a USB-connected Xbox One controller. With the two sticks, I found it was easier to move fluidly and aim at the same time. My kills have now shot up to 35, and I\u2019ve reached level 25.", "Once I solved that aiming and moving problem, I worked on other skills like playing with different characters or reviving teammates. Like Call of Duty\u2019s Blackout battle royale mode, the guns feel good in Apex Legends. If you\u2019re standing at the correct range, you can generally hit a target that you\u2019re aiming at. The weapons run out of ammo fast, so you have to hope to get extended clips as you gather loot. My favorite weapon combo is a Spitfire machine gun and a EVA-8 shotgun.", "Above: The victors: Dean is the one on the right, with zero kills in the match.", "I love the small nuances of Apex Legends. As in any battle royale game, you are vulnerable when reviewing the gear of someone who has been gunned down. While looting, the smart communications system tells you that if you pick up a new gun, it should automatically equip that gun with compatible attachments that you already have.", "Half the time, my microphone doesn\u2019t work. I don\u2019t know why, but I\u2019ve always had troubles with it on my Windows machine. I think I\u2019ll have to find friends on Discord and communicate that way instead. But you don\u2019t always need the microphone, as noted earlier. Often, I\u2019ll play with people who have hundreds of kills. But I\u2019ll also play randomly with people who have no kills. I defer to the veterans on where to land, but I notice they are invariably overconfident. They land in the zones where there are lots of enemies, and they wind up getting us all killed quickly. I like to land far away from the crowd, but I have trouble getting us to those locations upon jumping out of the spacecraft.", "Sometimes the veterans are harsh, criticizing me for failing to keep up with them or hit my targets. But others offer good advice. I tag along with them and on two occasions, they have carried me to victory. That\u2019s a nice feeling, and it\u2019s not as rare as with other matches. In Blackout, for instance, you have a one in 25 chance of winning. With Apex\u2019s three-player teams and 60-player roster, you have a one in 20 chance of winning. That has happened for me twice now, and you can see one of the matches in the video embedded in this game. Hilariously, at least to me, my comrades both got nine kills each in the match, while I got zero. But hey, at least I didn\u2019t get myself killed in this match. Other times, I get to play the veteran and lead our team so we don\u2019t get shot early or caught outside the shrinking circle.", "At some point, I may get tired of the map. But so far, I\u2019m enjoying myself. And I can see the infinite ways that Respawn can iterate and improve the game. They can, for instance, add new maps, new weapons, and new characters. I realize that we\u2019re on the ground floor of what could be a very long game. But Respawn should enjoy it while they can. After all, at this rate, somebody else could come out with a new battle royale game and knock out Apex Legends.", "But I have to say. Apex Legends is such a breath of fresh air.

John Gaeta, our head of creative strategies, Richard Taylor, one of our board members, and I were talking about the unfinished project of Walt Disney from the \u201860s, where he envisioned cities that were continuous prototype communities that would be never-ending innovation cycles. You\u2019d live within this blueprint of ever-changing innovation. He died a few months later. Then, they made Epcot, which was not really what he was up to. It\u2019s one of those unfinished thoughts.", "If you look at where the world is going, where spatial computing goes, and the \u2026 emergence of 5G, there\u2019s an opportunity to almost pick up that thought and modernize it and make it global.

But there\u2019s also the experiential wonder and magic that\u2019s a big part of what our company is about and infusing that into everyday life.", "Some big players will have competing visions that may be highly functional, that may be highly dystopian. We want ours to be one of a more positive view, a more open and transparent decentralized view, where cities and the people in them possess digital information as a natural resource. Not to be exploited but to benefit that particular community. How those communities get connected and have that become an economic amplifier, and in some sense, try to pick up a thought from a great person who \u2014 at the time you had the Soviet/U.S. angst about nuclear war.

That has spread throughout not just decades ago, but for thousands of years, there\u2019s been this positive thread of the future. We want our version to be seen as one of those.

Do I want the ability to add to this thing, or is it just simply monitoring all the time?

One of the assumptions was that there would be growing inequality as things like the development of mega-cities happen. You\u2019ll have so many cities over 25 million people. In some ways, it felt like technology could be used to address that, but the way the world is going, it\u2019s almost an unstoppable force, a trend that you can see coming for decades, this growing inequality.", "Abovitz:", " There are people who identify those issues, like how AI will overpower us, as trends there\u2019s no solution for. We\u2019re more practical. You can actually solve these problems. You could will collective force to say that we can solve those economic problems and break them down. Our goal is to use these systems to normalize economic distributions, to amplify people\u2019s capabilities to make health care much more available, make economic opportunity much more available, and distribute that more fairly based on people\u2019s merits. You give a lot more people access.", "If you bring a positive view to it and work to solve those problems in a collective way with the right partners, you can turn these things upside down. You\u2019re really nailing why we\u2019re bringing this up now, right in front of Mobile World. We\u2019ll continue to do it because you\u2019ll have these different voices, dystopia and utopia. Are there problems we can\u2019t solve or problems we can solve? We believe you can solve these things. We call that technology in the service of humanity.", "VentureBeat: This sounds awfully complicated. Have you been at this for some number years, trying to pull this together? How many companies have to be involved?", "Abovitz:", " A number. Our supply chain and our partnership chain is immensely large. We\u2019re announcing some of the largest ones. When you\u2019re doing what we\u2019re doing and you raise the capital we\u2019re raising, it\u2019s not only about a single device. It\u2019s about building a whole ecology and community around the new form of computing and how that integrates into society.", "A great example is the AT&T partnership. It\u2019s the first of many, but the ubiquity of high bandwidth, low latency 5G networks is a huge enabler to this vision. It accelerates it. It\u2019s complicated.

That\u2019s their vision of where the future goes. Those are cool technology ambitions. What we see as our vision and goal for establishing Magicverse across the United States and the globe is our version of a big moon shot.

Let\u2019s fix what we have right now.", "The experiences you can have collectively will probably exceed anything we can do, even if we travel the entire universe. This allows the creative collective universe to be explored. I call that inner space. That\u2019s a very powerful force. There are good ways to connect people through that. The underlying drive is there is a new internet forming, a spatial internet on top of 5G. Our version of that, what we call Magicverse, is a particular, hopefully socially good, more positive form. We think it\u2019s going to be an incredibly strong force in economic and computing development over the next 10 and 20 years, with things that are not so far away. 2019, 2020, 2021, you\u2019ll see major activity in 5G and the things we\u2019re doing.", "The interesting thing is, hundreds of billions of dollars are already being spent building that new infrastructure by the telco companies and governments. Probably close to a trillion dollars if you include China.", "Above: Mica is a digital human demo for the Magic Leap One.", "VentureBeat: I was going to mention, the nice thing for you is they\u2019re building 5G anyway without this in mind.

On a similar trajectory, the VR industry has been in a ", "trough of disillusionment", " since 2016, two years after ", "Facebook purchased Oculus", " for $2 billion. Despite strong hardware progress, and a vibrant developer ecosystem, the adoption numbers have not grown fast enough for VCs to pile in. In Q3 2017, ", "VR/AR investments were at a all-time low", " since 2015.", "So it is fair to say that when knocking on VCs doors in 2017 trying to raise money for Admix, our adtech company for VR, did not have an easy sell. This is what we learnt through 60 pitches, before we eventually met the right investors.", "Ask any early stage VC about their investment criteria, and they will likely say: team, market, product. Although all are important, market is the most critical of the four for fundraising. Carried by a strong market wave, you\u2019ll probably do fine with an okay product.", "VCs have strong opinions about the \u201chotness\u201d of a market, so much so that facts and data are often not enough to change their minds. From Q1 to Q3 2017, we saw a 300 percent increase of inbound requests for our service, both on the developer and advertiser side. That didn\u2019t matter \u2014 we had a VR (and adtech) black cloud hanging over our heads. Before even talking to us, VCs were convinced that the VR market was on the decline and it wasn\u2019t the right time to invest.", "Fundraising when the market is against you is an uphill battle. Instead, we decided to bootstrap longer and wait it out. Having a unshakable belief in the VR/AR market, it was a no-brainer for us that the market would eventually turn around. Indeed, the market started picking up end of Q3 2017 when ", "ARKit got released", ", created new opportunities to put AR in the hands of millions.", "Shortly after, Magic Leap, the AR hardware manufacturer announced a massive $500 million investment round, and ", "revealed their long awaited product", ". At the same time, Pokemon Go developer Niantic ", "raised $200 million", " to build new AR experiences. None of these news pieces affected the immediate adoption of VR/AR, but they were lights at the end of the tunnel, giving the market a breath of fresh air. We used that momentum to start actively pitching to VCs.", "An aura of positivity around the market is key to de-risk the proposition, so try to align your fund-raising campaign with these. To be able to do so, make sure you have enough runway when you start raising \u2014 at least 6 months, but ideally with the ability to extend to 9 months.", "Once the market timing is right, your pitch will be received differently. Your job now is to show that you can grow quicker than the market and are the right startup to back.", "Founders can be excited about many things in the business: the growth of the team, new clients, new product features; and they try to emphasize all of these to the investors. These are a lot of factors to balance, and it can sometimes be overwhelming for VCs to really understand the value proposition that makes your company special.", "I\u2019ve always tried to simplify the pitch as much as possible, and make it about one underlying belief that is so obvious that investors almost can\u2019t say no. For Admix, the pitch went like this:", "I know you believe that VR and AR are the next media revolution, therefore it must have a sustainable business model to fuel it. If you look at 150 years of media evolution, you cannot deny that advertising is this business model, and that huge opportunities are created for every new media. Therefore, the only thing that you need to decide on, is if Admix is the best ad solution for VR/AR to invest in.", "And then goes the more detailed pitch about team, traction and strategy.", "This is a pretty direct way to put it, but doing so, we ticked multiple boxes. We knew investors we talked to believed in VR/AR, and to the previous point, our timing was right. The second point about advertising is a fact that investors couldn\u2019t argue. That way, they had to agree that a massive opportunity existed. That\u2019s 80 percent of the work done \u2014 the \u201conly\u201d thing to decide on, was if we were the right company to capitalize on the opportunity.", "As a founder, you should be convinced that a massive opportunity exists \u2014 which is why you started the business in the first place. Try to demonstrate it clearly to the investors in a way that they almost can\u2019t disagree.", "In new markets, like VR and AR, there have been very little exits, making it difficult for investors to assess potential returns. In the adtech space, it was even worse \u2014 most exits after 2015 were disappointing IPOs or asset sales to other adtech businesses for a fraction of their previous valuations. Many VCs we spoke to had lost money on those deals. Knowing that, positioning Admix as an adtech company was not a good idea: we had to find other references.", "Benchmarks are key for investors because they de-risk the proposition, proof that at least a similar business has found massive success in the past. This is why investors look for \u201cUber for X\u201d or \u201cAirbnb for Y.\u201d", "Instead of trying to compare Admix to recent successes, we took a long term approach. Looking at the past 20 years, there has been massive successes for companies building advertising solution for emerging media: DoubleClick, Yahoo, and Google on the web, Admob on mobile, Facebook on social. Where attention goes, media dollars eventually go. That is how we structured our pitch: we are approaching the dawn of a new media (VR/AR) which will create a huge opportunity for monetization and this is what Admix aims to solve.", "Nothing groundbreaking there, but notice the subtlety. We positioned Admix as a VR/AR company first to take advantage of the market uptrend, but we later positioned it as an adtech company because benchmarks are obvious. Having a company sitting across industries helps, but I believe this can be done for every business. Try to show that history is repeating itself \u2014 just in a different context.", "VCs like big opportunities \u2014 and by big, I mean billion-dollar opportunities. A $100 million exit would be disappointing to most. That is not greed, but simply the mechanics of the fund. VCs know that some of their investments will flop, therefore, the successful ones need to be successful enough to cover for these losses. Peter Thiel, early investor in Facebook, goes as far as saying that the best investment ", "outperforms the entire rest of the fund", ".", "So, you have to show a big vision behind your product. In our case, we could have positioned our pitch as advertising in VR/AR, but this doesn\u2019t reveal the scale of the opportunity. Instead, we pitched the vision of building a sustainable business model in VR/AR, to empower VR/AR developers to become successful. The fact that it is advertising is secondary to that big, bold mission. Doing so also gave us lot of room to grow our product and services as the company progresses. Recently, we acquired VRFocus, which would have seemed weird for an advertising company. However, it makes perfect sense given our broader mission \u2014 empowering VR/AR developers to be successful.", "Pitching big also helps to distance yourself from other players in a difficult space. In adtech for example, differentiation has been very difficult lately: many demand side platforms seem to be proposing the same services to advertisers, and many supply side platforms seem to be proposing the same services to publishers. This is partly why the ", "investment has dried up", ". The last thing you want to do it being seen as another of them \u2013 instead, your big vision almost sets you apart from the pack. We have investors that would never invest in adtech \u2014 but Admix\u2019s much larger vision appealed to them.

I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ve ever talked about this before, but I\u2019m a huge Marshall McLuhan fan. \u201cThe medium is the message.\u201d When we were doing Legacy of Kain, we did a content-based game where you\u2019re playing an anti-hero, a vampire, where the whole world wants to kill you. But when creating that game I studied the medium. The medium back in the day was, the PlayStation gave us the CD-ROM. We could have full voice acting. The traditional RPGs where you read the story in text on a TV monitor, I hated those. I said, \u201cLet\u2019s get professional voice actors.\u201d We did this before Metal Gear Solid came out. We were one of the first groups to incorporate live actors to tell the story. That was studying the medium.", "What we\u2019re doing now, and where I think the story is interesting for you and for others out there, is we\u2019re taking that same approach with Deadhaus Sonata, where we\u2019re studying the medium and saying, \u201cWhat can we do with this new medium?\u201d It\u2019s changed so much. With Legacy of Kain you\u2019re in front of a console, alone on the TV screen, playing a single-player game. Now it\u2019s all multiplayer. Everyone thinks storytelling is dead in multiplayer.", "Deadhaus Sonata is multiplayer, but you can play alone if you want. The idea is, let\u2019s take this medium and make it something special. That\u2019s one of the reasons we\u2019re so excited about Lumberyard. Lumberyard is incorporated with an AWS stack from the ground up. It\u2019s all multiplayer. It scales. It\u2019s incorporated into Twitch. People watching people play video games has become its own medium. More people watch people playing games than are actually playing. Imagine if you incorporate these types into your game. That\u2019s where we\u2019re going with Deadhaus Sonata. We want to flip it on its head. We think there\u2019s a massive opportunity out there to start thinking in that direction.", "Above: Other inspirations for Deadhaus Sonata include Bloodbourne.", "We want to revolutionize the way people think and consume content.

Not just better power-ups and some of the hooks people have put in, but fully integrate that into the experience.", "We\u2019re free to play. That\u2019s obviously been so successful. The current thing that we\u2019re seeing with the traditional triple-A market is people slowly trying to adopt the cloud model, which is what we talked about years and years ago. Clouds are the future. Free to play is the future. Games as a service is absolutely the future. There\u2019s much more money to be made there, and you get happier consumers as well. They can pay when they want to, not when they have to.", "Twitch integration is really important. Asymmetrical game design is also extremely important. We\u2019re going to make sure every time you play a different class, it\u2019s an entirely new experience, not just different moves and different powers. We want people to feel very differently.", "GamesBeat: Could that be\u2014you have 200 zombies chasing down one human, something like that?", "Dyack:", " Definitely like that. Have you played a board game called Cthulhu Wars? It\u2019s a very good asymmetrical game. When you play, say, the King in Yellow versus Nyarlathotep, which are different Old Ones in the Cthulhu universe, it plays like a different game. What we want to do\u2013when you\u2019re playing a vampire versus playing a revenant, it feels totally different.", "The last think we\u2019re doing is we want to really drive community-driven content. Not just on the Twitch level, but on the level where they can participate in the content itself, world-building in a way where they can truly contributed. We think that\u2019s truly going to be the game-changer. These types of things are really well-suited to where we\u2019re going. People ask why we\u2019re using Lumberyard, and this is why. We love all this stuff. It\u2019s modular. It has a great renderer. It allows us to do all of this things.", "Above: Deadhaus Sonata is inspired by Dyack\u2019s previous games and the writing of H.P. Lovecraft.", "We\u2019re a third-person RPG, but if you want to mix two games together, we\u2019re Bloodborne meets Diablo. We\u2019re a co-op dungeon crawler, PC and console. We can go to mobile too if we need to. Online all the time. Mid- to hardcore. Lumberyard engine. We\u2019re using a trinary archetype system to build all of our classes, which is very different. We trademarked it for fun. Someone told us to last night.", "Here\u2019s an example of what I mean. We have physical, magical, and essence, which is essentially artifacts. You\u2019ll be playing revenants, wraiths, vampires, liches, banshees, ghouls, wights. All of them will play extremely differently and do different things. As an example, the vampire has blood magic. You\u2019ll suck blood from people and use your blood to cast spells. The Legacy of Kain community is really resonating with this. It\u2019s been 20 years since they had a Legacy of Kain game, and a lot of people have said, \u201cHey, this looks a lot like Kain.\u201d We had one of the old hardcore fans that have been following Kain for 20 years do an interview with us on our YouTube channel. It\u2019s been fun.", "Lots of itemization, hundreds and thousands of weapons and armor pieces and that stuff. We\u2019ve been thinking about this a long time, and not because of all the shit that hit the fan recently. This is something we truly believe in. Monetization cannot be pay to win. You can\u2019t use money to give players an advantage. You have to focus on ethical things. No loot boxes. Things that essentially make people look better, but when it comes down to the play style\u2014we\u2019ll eventually introduce PvP, but money will give you no advantage whatsoever. It\u2019s all skill-based. That\u2019s super-important.", "GamesBeat: Like the Warframe model.", "Dyack:", " Yeah, Warframe, Path of Exile. They do it well. There are very few that do it well. But this is only the beginning. We have many \u201chauses\u201d that are coming. We\u2019re starting with Deadhaus, but eventually there will be Dreamhaus, Gigahaus, Divinehaus, Haus of the High Angels, Haus Legion. We have 10 years of content we\u2019re prepared to roll out on a regular basis. It\u2019s all about the service model, all about making people feel like they\u2019re getting something. Getting that community in the actual development is the product is a key factor, feeling like they\u2019re part of something.", "GamesBeat: Can you talk more about being \u201cback from the dead,\u201d that whole tough experience you had?", "Dyack:", " I\u2019ve had some pretty huge successes and some pretty traumatic failures. I think this game, in many senses, represents that. When I talk about the House of the Dead, I feel like talking about myself. Silicon Knights is dead. It\u2019s never coming back. With the launch of Apocalypse, I\u2019ve gone through some things and can bring that experience to light in ways that I think are refreshing and new. I want to use that experience to create something pretty awesome.", "I don\u2019t know, quite frankly, if I could have done this with Silicon Knights. With Silicon Knights we were built into the model of the old triple-A, make a game for millions of dollars over four or five years, drop it, and then get another one. With Deadhaus Sonata we\u2019re looking at a 10-year rollout cycle where we\u2019re believing in the community, getting it out there for people to pay as they want, but thinking the monetization is there. If they like it they\u2019ll support it. That\u2019s the future. I don\u2019t think I could have done that with Silicon Knights.", "Where I am now compared to when we last talked, over 10 years ago, I\u2019m a very different person. If you want to know anything about the games that I\u2019ve created, whether it\u2019s Blood Omen or Eternal Darkness or Too Human, there\u2019s always a part of me in there. A large part of Deadhaus is the story of the House of the Dead. What\u2019s their story? From that perspective, I feel it resonates with me personally.", "Above: Deadhaus Sonata will be out in a couple of years or so.", "GamesBeat: Was there no question that it was going to be in this kind of horror genre?", "Dyack:", " It wasn\u2019t really like that at all. I wrote the story\u2013my mother broke her hip, actually. We were really worried about her. While she was in the hospital, I was babysitting her cat, and I wrote the story and sent it to Warren. It was just how I felt. Warren really liked it. You haven\u2019t seen any of the content, but there\u2019s a very rich story, and we\u2019re going to hold to that. It\u2019s equivalent to a lot of the games I\u2019ve done before, except we\u2019ll roll this out through multiplayer.", "I\u2019ve always been a huge believer in content and storytelling. The best content and storytelling comes from your soul, comes from who you are. I think that resonates in Deadhaus Sonata.", "GamesBeat: I remember a lot about\u2014you got into a lot of arguments with fans. Now everyone has to embrace their fans, but some of them are still argumentative. Are you ready to dive back in?", "Dyack:", " Oh, I\u2019m definitely ready to dive back in. It\u2019s not true that\u2014I argued with some fans. When we were working on Eternal Darkness I was really huge in the IGN community. As a matter of fact I remember talking to Nintendo. They said, \u201cBe careful what you post, because it\u2019s affecting our stock.\u201d But the problem with message boards is understanding the medium. A lot of people think that the medium \u2014 this is all going back to McLuhan again \u2013 that technology allows us to communicate more. Which is not actually true. It allows us to communicate in more ways. But what it also does is reduce the bandwidth of communication.", "When we talk in person, you see my expression. You can hear my tone of voice, if I\u2019m excited or depressed or whatever it\u2019s going to be. You can\u2019t see that in text. You see all capitals and you think I\u2019m yelling, when I might have hit caps lock by mistake. This reduced bandwidth creates massive miscommunication, which creates these arguments. In many ways\u2014I would always go forward and say, \u201cThis is what I believe.\u201d There would be massive amounts of engagement on the positive and negative scale.", "With some of the hardcore forums, I did get into it. Do I intend to do that again? I don\u2019t know. I guess I intend to do it in different ways. But I\u2019ve never stopped reaching out to different forums and communities. We\u2019ll always correct misinformation. So I guess I\u2019m going to dive back in. It\u2019s been a while. I haven\u2019t been around in six or eight years. This is the first time I\u2019ve been at this conference. One guy came up and said, \u201cMy God, I haven\u2019t seen you since 2008.\u201d It\u2019s been a while.", "GamesBeat: It must feel good to be in a creative mode.", "Dyack:", " It\u2019s the only place I ever want to be. Warren is doing the business side. He\u2019s representing us on biz dev. I get to be all creative. I\u2019m super excited. We have a new studio. We started it last year. We\u2019ve been around a year now and we\u2019re growing steady. Ten employees in the studio in Niagara Falls, Canada, and other people working remote. We have a community manager in Seattle. It\u2019s about 15-16 people all in all. Several Ph.Ds and academics from different universities are on the team. It\u2019s because we\u2019re doing some very aggressive things in the online space. There\u2019s going to be a lot of research. Postdocs are joining on board.", "GamesBeat: Did you have to raise money?", "Dyack:", " Yep. We have some investment, and I\u2019m also funding it right now. We\u2019re growing rapidly. We\u2019re talking to potential partners now.", "Above: Deadhaus Sonata", "GamesBeat: Are you going to try crowdfunding?", "Dyack:", " I don\u2019t think so. We\u2019re toying with the idea, but\u2013we certainly might try to go it all alone. The publishing route, the traditional route that Silicon Knights used to do, we\u2019re talking to people to see if there\u2019s alignment there. There\u2019s also more on the investment side. We can always look for another round of investment. The other option is to just go on our own and launch a store. There are possibilities across the board. Those are the tacks we\u2019re taking. We\u2019ll see how it goes.", "This is the first time we\u2019ve ever shown gameplay. This is early. What you see here, it\u2019s running in the Lumberyard engine. There are no pre-baked textures, so it\u2019s not optimized, but what you see here is completely procedurally generated.", "GamesBeat: Is this better for some things as opposed to Unity or Unreal?", "Dyack:", " All the stuff I talked about, it\u2019s built from the ground up to support it. Amazon owns Twitch. We\u2019ve got really good exposure into Amazon\u2019s full stack of cloud technologies and scaling technologies. All the games like Fortnite and Apex Legends, they all use Amazon servers, regardless of the engine. It just happens that Amazon is tied into that even more.", "This is the vampire. Taking blood\u2013as a vampire you can suck in blood. It gives you life and it weakens them. I\u2019ll show you the axes. These are my personal fave. This is switching weapons. With the axes you can do all kinds of fun spells. This is all procedurally generated, so every time I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s going to look like. I don\u2019t know where enemies are. The idea is, imagine creating an environment that anyone can contribute to, that\u2019s procedurally generated in the right way, that people can use to create great levels.", "This is the revenant. He\u2019s built on hate. The more he kills, the more angry he gets. But he also has a lot of fun moves. This is all action-RPG. Imagine you have skills, thousands of weapons. Six people can play at the same time. This is the thing we\u2019re going to build. It\u2019s going to be a while until it\u2019s out, but we do think people are going to like what they see. Once we optimize this and get going\u2013this is not running on a very fast machine. We rented this machine out for $500. It\u2019s a 1080i, not a very fast card.", "GamesBeat: How do you set up things like missions when it\u2019s all procedural?", "Dyack:", " Imagine that people participating can also change the parameters. We want people to have as much fun watching as they do in actually playing.", "GamesBeat: How far along would you say you are?", "Dyack:", " Very early. Super pre-production. We haven\u2019t shown any of this to the public, and we\u2019re probably not going to show it for a while yet. The company has been around only a year. That means starting from employee one. What you see here is a few months worth of development. The storyline has always been worked on, but these take time. There\u2019s a fleshed-out story and we know where we want to go with it, but it will take time to get in all the details. We have some fun things planned for the future.", "Above: Apocalypse Studios is based in Niagara Falls, Canada.", "GamesBeat: How do you get over the fact that people don\u2019t usually play the bad guy? This is something different for people.", "Dyack:", " It was the same with Legacy of Kain, really. I\u2019m a big fan of perspective. Who, out there, thinks they\u2019re a bad person? Very few people think they\u2019re a bad person. What would it be like to play from the perspective of something that you would think is innately evil, and what would it be like seeing it through their eyes? Those perspectives are unique.", "When we created Kain, we felt that it offered something different. Back then, a lot of people were looking for games like Zelda. When we created Legacy of Kain we wanted to create a dark Zelda. In a sense, here you have a lot of fantasy titles, and you\u2019re fighting demons and the undead. We\u2019re looking at it from the perspective of, what would it be like to play that side? If you were undead, what would your motivations be? If you\u2019re a ghoul and you have to eat human flesh, what would that mean? What would your rationale for survival be?", "I\u2019m a big fan of anthropology. What would it be, when you look at survival of the species, what would that be for you? What would that perspective mean? I think that\u2019s unique. I don\u2019t think a lot of people do that. People should do it more. I can only tell you that I make things I like to play. That\u2019s why we\u2019re doing it. I think it\u2019s very interesting.", "It\u2019s one of the golden rules, right? In entertainment, you can never guarantee that you\u2019re going to please everyone. If you make something you like yourself, you\u2019re guaranteed to please at least one person.", "GamesBeat: Can you talk more about your thinking around McLuhan?", "Dyack:", " Like I say, the medium is the message. With Legacy of Kain, I was taking the same spiritual approach. Legacy of Kain, I looked at the medium and said, \u201cWhat does this offer?\u201d It\u2019s a game console with a huge amount of storage. We can use voice instead of text. Now, if you study the medium, the medium is so different. It\u2019s all multiplayer-based. Twitch is one of the biggest things going on in video games right now. More people will watch a League of Legends tournament than the Super Bowl.", "That\u2019s an extremely different medium than the traditional console days. That\u2019s changing the landscape for video games whether people acknowledge it or not. Some of the problems you see with monetization models \u2014 gamers getting upset, publishers not doing as well as they want, these free-to-play games springing up and doing gangbusters \u2014 are all toward this trend of a new medium. Like it or not, it\u2019s this huge gravity well pulling us there.", "GamesBeat: Does free-to-play make development easier? You can get a viable product out and see what the audience wants.", "Dyack:", " It\u2019s different. We talked about going onto the forums. Back when I was working on Eternal Darkness and I was on the IGN forums, I was trying to interact with the audience to see what they wanted. With these kinds of games, you can launch early and get feedback right away, and then continue to iterate on that.", "That\u2019s a million times better than working on a game for three to four years, dropping it, doing a couple of patches, maybe some DLC, and then doing another one. That model is inherently difficult for getting community feedback. You look at these models, there\u2019s nothing better. Getting that participation not only helps you bond with your community, which is critical for success, but it allows the community to participate in ways that have never been available before. That\u2019s what this new medium gives you.", "Above: Deadhaus Sonata will have Twitch integration.", "GamesBeat: If you were to go full indie, not using a publisher and going direct to the stores, do you see that as more viable now?", "Dyack:", " It\u2019s an option. It\u2019s going to depend on what the best thing is for the game. Time is going to tell. Back in the Silicon Knights days, I would say you\u2019re way better off going with a publisher. Now, with the way the industry\u2019s changed, the marketing and distribution channels have basically fallen away. I know there\u2019s still some places in Europe where you need to sell boxes and get physical merchandise out. But in most places now you\u2019re pretty good if you go pure digital. That means it\u2019s just about what\u2019s the best for the game.", "A lot of video game publishers have a huge knowledge of marketing and their player base. They have a lot they can contribute. In some sense a partnership might make sense. But is it better to get venture, or is it better to finance it yourself? Those possibilities are real. If you look at Warframe, as an example \u2014 Digital Extremes is just a few hours away from us \u2014 they self-funded for a while before they were bought out. Or you look at Path of Exile, which was five guys who had never done a game before, or at least that\u2019s what I understand. They went out and did an awesome Diablo-like game. I still play it all the time.", "The field is open. All the possibilities are there. Choosing a direction is going to depend on the parties involved. You never know. It\u2019s hard for me to say right now which direction we\u2019re going, but I can say we\u2019re looking at everything.", "GamesBeat: It seems like you can get a lot done with a team that\u2019s relatively small.", "Dyack:", " We\u2019re starting small. We\u2019re going to get bigger. We\u2019re likely to be 100 people by next year. However, it\u2019s all going to depend on scaling appropriately for where we\u2019re going. We\u2019ll want to get early alpha or pre-alphas out as soon as we can to start working with the community. We want the feedback.", "What you\u2019re seeing here, we want people to play it. Do you like this? Do you not like this? There\u2019s a lot more to go. This is super early. But we want to see what the procedural generation will yield, what people like about it, what we should change. What do you like about this class archetype? Do you like the way the revenant plays? What do you think about the vampire? As we release more classes, that kind of feedback with the audience\u2013it\u2019s irreplaceable.", "If you look at a game like League of Legends, it\u2019s based on community-developed archetypes from DOTA. DOTA was completely made from the ground up by the community. Now we have League of Legends, this huge monster game, a really good game. That type of game wouldn\u2019t have been possible 20 years ago.", "GamesBeat: You mentioned Bloodborne. How unforgiving is Deadhaus Sonata? ", "Dyack:", " There are different modes for that kind of stuff. Most games like this, in the action-RPG genre, will have a hardcore mode. If you die once, that\u2019s it. Your character then goes to the non-hardcore mode. Or it can be super hardcore, where you die and it gets deleted. But we\u2019ll have different variants and levels. We want a mid- to hardcore grouping for our audience. We\u2019re going to make it forgiving if you want it to be. If you want it completely unforgiving, we can do that too.", "GamesBeat: Are you working with a lot of the same people you\u2019ve worked with before?", "Dyack:", " It\u2019s almost a new team from the ground up. There are some people that I ping now and again, some old Silicon Knights friends and colleagues that we pull in from time to time. But it\u2019s essentially a brand new team. We\u2019re in a different location, but we still love the Niagara region and the ice wine. We\u2019re an hour south of Toronto.", "GamesBeat: I don\u2019t hear as many folks touting story ahead of other features these days. You don\u2019t see a lot of that in things like battle royale.", "Dyack:", " We think the battle royale market is well-served right now. [laughs] We\u2019re not interested in that market whatsoever. We think it\u2019s time for a gothic, dark fantasy, our Lovecraftian tale. We\u2019re doing it in a different way. In many ways it\u2019s going back to my roots, but in other ways we\u2019re taking on things we learned in Eternal Darkness and Too Human. We\u2019re putting them all together and looking at the medium. This is what we\u2019re spinning.

It comes after Ctrl-labs secured $28 million in financing last May, and it brings the company\u2019s total raised to $67 million.", "CEO Thomas Reardon said the fresh capital will be put toward growing the company\u2019s recently opened research and development lab in San Francisco, and toward supporting its commercial partnerships. He also says it\u2019ll be used to build and distribute Ctrl-labs\u2019 developer kit \u2014 Ctrl-kit \u2014 which it unveiled at Slush in Helsinki, Finland in December.", "Ctrl-kit is currently in preview for select partners, and is expected to begin shipping by the end of Q1 2019.", "\u201cLike the developers and creators we hear from, we feel fundamentally dissatisfied with the pervading technologies of the last century,\u201d he added. \u201cOur objective with Ctrl-kit is to give the industry\u2019s most ambitious minds the tools they need to reimagine the relationship between humans and machines.\u201d", "Much has changed since Ctrl-labs began prototyping its neural interface technology in 2017, Adam Berenzweig, director of research and development, told VentureBeat in an earlier phone interview. It\u2019s no longer tethered by wires to a Raspberry Pi, as was the case with previous incarnations, and the wireless radios are now packed tightly into a wrist-worn enclosure that\u2019s the size of a \u201clarge watch\u201d and wired to a component with electrodes that sits further up the arm. Furthermore, latency has been reduced, and the algorithms that predict intent are \u201csignificantly better\u201d than they were before.", "Above: Ctrl-labs\u2019 Ctrl-kit.", "\u00a0", "On the software side of the equation, the accompanying SDK is \u201cmore mature,\u201d with built-out JavaScript and TypeScript toolchains and new prebuilt demos that give an idea of the hardware\u2019s capabilities. Programming is largely done through WebSockets, which provide a full-duplex communications channel.", "\u201cWe\u2019re at the point of the launch where \u2026 we want to get it out [to] developers,\u201d Berenzweig said.", "The final version of Ctrl-kit will be in one piece, and it won\u2019t be an entirely self-contained affair. The developer kit has to be wirelessly tethered to a PC for some processing, but the goal is to get to the point where overhead is such that it can run on wearable system-on-chips.", "The underlying tech remains the same. Ctrl-kit leverages differential electromyography (EMG) to translate mental intent into action, specifically by measuring changes in electrical potential caused by impulses traveling from the brain to hand muscles. Sixteen electrodes monitor the motor neuron signals amplified by the muscle fibers of motor units, from which they measure signals, and with the help of AI algorithms trained using Google\u2019s TensorFlow distinguish between the individual pulses of each nerve.", "The system works independently of muscle movement; generating a brain activity pattern that Ctrl-labs\u2019 tech can detect requires no more than the firing of a neuron down an axon, or what neuroscientists call action potential. That puts it a class above wearables that use electroencephalography (EEG), a technique that measures electrical activity in the brain through contacts pressed against the scalp. EMG devices draw from the cleaner, clearer signals from motor neurons, and as a result are limited only by the accuracy of the software\u2019s machine learning model and the snugness of the contacts against the skin", "As for what Ctrl-labs expects its early adopters to build with Ctrl-kit, video games top the list \u2014 particularly virtual reality games, which Berenzweig believes are a natural fit for the sort of immersive experiences EMG can deliver. (Imagine swiping through an inventory screen with a hand gesture, or piloting a fighter jet just by thinking about the direction you want to fly.) And not too long ago, Ctrl-labs demonstrated a virtual keyboard that maps finger movements to PC inputs, allowing a wearer to type messages by tapping on a tabletop with their fingertips.", "It remains to be seen if Ctrl-labs can succeed where others have failed. In October, Amazon-backed wearables company\u00a0", "Thalmic Labs", "\u00a0killed its gesture- and motion-guided Myo armband, which similarly tapped the electrical activity in arm muscles to control devices.", "Still, it\u2019s managed to attract talent like former Apple autonomous systems engineer Tarin Ziyaee, who\u2019s heading up dev at Ctrl-labs\u2019 San Francisco office, and Anthony Moschella, previously vice president of product at Peloton and MakerBot. Moreover, investors like Erik Nordlander, general partner at GV, are convinced that Ctrl-labs\u2019 early momentum \u2014 in addition to the robustness of its developer tools \u2014 will help it gain an early lead in the brain-machine interface race.", "\u201cCtrl-labs\u2019 development of neural interfaces will empower developers to create novel experiences across a wide variety of applications,\u201d he said. \u201cThe company has assembled a team of top neuroscientists, engineers, and developers with deep technology backgrounds, creating human-computer interactions unlike anything we have seen before.\u201d"], "spider_name": "venturebeat", "id": "venturebeat_post-2466890"}

What the Radeon VII doesn\u2019t do is undercut Nvidia either in terms of price or performance. Instead, the Radeon VII is a lot like an RTX 2080 \u2014 only AMD is making different promises for the future.", "The Radeon VII gets its name because it\u2019s the second-generation Vega card (Radeon Vega 2), and it features the new 7nm process (Radeon 7). That new smaller process means that AMD\u2019s chip design produces less heat and can safely draw more power. It\u2019s enabling AMD to compete with Nvidia right now. But when it comes to competing in the future, the Radeon VII\u2019s marquee feature is its 16GB of second-gen high-bandwidth memory (HBM2).", "So is the Radeon VII worth it? Is it better than the RTX 2080? And do you need more video RAM or RTX features like ray tracing and DLSS? Let\u2019s find out.", "The Radeon VII and RTX 2080 are roughly equivalent in terms of traditional performance.\u00a0 And by roughly I mean that the 2080 is significantly faster in some games and the Radeon VII is faster in others. I\u2019ll include some benchmark charts below, but you can expect both cards to do fine with games on ultra settings at a 4K resolution.", "I tested them both with the following hardware:", "Unsurprisingly, the Radeon VII is faster in games that have an AMD logo when you boot them up. The RTX 2080, likewise, is faster in games with an Nvidia splash screen. In more neutral games, the RTX 2080 runs Grand Theft Auto V and Hitman about 10 percent faster.

But the good news is that AMD and Nvidia are both looking beyond the traditional.", "While Nvidia has tried to sell its latest cards on the potential of technologies like real-time ray tracing and deep-learning super-sampling, AMD is focusing on super-fast memory and production work. But does any of this matter? Yes \u2014 but some of it will matter more depending on what you use the cards for.", "The problem with RTX is that very few games support its technologies. Battlefield V, Metro Exodus, and Final Fantasy XV all feature either ray tracing or DLSS. That\u2019s it.", "The good news for Nvidia is that ray tracing looks impressive even if it hurts performance. And DLSS does increase performance while maintaining a sharp image in Final Fantasy XV.", "When I turned off all of the Nvidia-specific features for the Final Fantasy XV benchmark (it has a lot of them), the Radeon VII struggled, but the RTX 2080 didn\u2019t have a massive advantage. But Final Fantasy XV supports DLSS, and that feature enabled the 2080 to run the benchmark 45 percent faster than the Radeon VII.", "Above: DLSS seems potentially huge for performance.", "But until developers start putting RTX into more games, it\u2019s impossible to say whether this tech will matter in the future.", "For its part, AMD is expecting memory to play a more vital role in future games. And it included a lot of extra-speedy video RAM in the Radeon VII. The 16GB of memory is capable of through-putting more than 1TB of data per second. What is that good for? Well, it should enable developers to push through an astounding amount of 4K or even 8K textures.", "But almost no game is going to stress memory to the point that 16GB is necessary. At least not yet. That said, developers may begin to create games that approaches the limit now that a card can support it. Ubisoft open-world games certainly seem like prime candidates, and AMD claims that a certain scene in Far Cry 5 already does benefit from HBM2.", "Even if some games do take advantage of full potential of the Radeon VII, most games will try to stay within a much more modest video-RAM budget. So like RTX, we have to wait and see if this makes a difference in the real world.", "But the one area that isn\u2019t in question is productivity. Both cards have great features that make them ideal for certain kinds of creative work.", "The Radeon VII is outstanding in OpenCL tasks like Blender \u2014 at least when I could get Blender working. The early drivers I have are buggy, and a lot of the tests I was planning to do broke. I\u2019ve done enough to see that when AMD\u2019s driver team catches up with this hardware, the Radeon VII should serve as an excellent option for people in the prosumer space looking to work with OpenCL tools.", "Neither card has a substantial edge in video production \u2014 especially in something like Adobe Premiere. But the RTX 2080 has an updated video encoder that makes it great for recording gameplay or livestreaming. The latest version of NVENC (Nvidia encoder) is only available in RTX cards at the moment, and it potentially eliminates the need for a two-PC setup for livestreamers.", "With NVENC, you can play a game and then encode it on the GPU without hitting game performance or touching the CPU. But in the past, NVENC has looked noisy and compressed compared to a CPU-powered x264 encoding at the same bitrate. This new NVENC, however, matches x264 quality at lower bitrates, and it makes the RTX cards ideal for anyone who does a lot of streaming.", "As with gaming performance, the RTX 2080 and Radeon VII are pretty similar when it comes to how hot and loud they are. Neither card gets much above 80c under the heaviest load.", "But in noise, the RTX 2080 is definitely quieter more of the time. When both devices are running with fans at top speed, they sound the same. But the Radeon VII ramps up to higher fan speeds faster and more often, so in real-world use it is generally louder more often than Nvidia\u2019s card.", "At the same time, the Radeon VII\u2019s three fans don\u2019t make any high-pitched whirring noises, so while the GPU is on the louder side, it isn\u2019t exactly annoying.", "So should you go with team red or team green? And the answer to that is going to depend on a few things.", "First, don\u2019t go with either unless you\u2019re gaming in 4K. Even if you want 1440p at 144Hz, you are much better off with a $350 RTX 2060 (especially if you overclock it).", "Second, you should go with the Radeon VII if you work with 3D art applications like Blender. And you should go with the RTX 2080 if you like to livestream to Twitch or record video for YouTube.", "Finally, you need to choose who to believe about the future. Do you think ray tracing and DLSS will matter before extremely fast high-capacity memory? Then you should get the RTX 2080. If you believe the opposite, then plunk down $700 for the Radeon VII.", "I think all of these things will matter eventually, but I would put my money on DLSS mattering the most to me over the next couple of years.", "Developers are going to salivate over more video memory, but they\u2019re going to have to keep making games that also work with consoles and RTX 2060s that only have 6GB of video RAM. That\u2019s going to limit how a game can take advantage of the Radeon VII.", "But DLSS is showing up in games now, and it is making a huge performance impact. It is such a drastic improvement that it could potentially even make ray tracing viable on the lower end RTX cards. And in four or five years, when the RTX 2080 is starting to feel slow, I expect DLSS to make the RTX 2080 feel significantly faster than the Radeon VII."], "spider_name": "venturebeat", "id": "venturebeat_post-2463401"}

Other developers tackle this problem by partnering with a publisher for the marketing and sales of the game, but that results in putting the game\u2019s destiny in the hands of a third party, Roberts said.

That reflected the shift of work to overseas locations as well as the conversion of contractors to full-time employees. Costs in areas of operations \u2014 such as online service, customer support, marketing, and servers (which number in the hundreds on Amazon Web Services), rose to $7.1 million in 2017.

But then that yields data we can plug into a machine learning algorithm and say, \u201cNext time Matt comes in, you should check and see what\u2019s going on. His reaction times are going down. He\u2019s starting to not perform as well at short-term memory tasks.\u201d", "It\u2019s that alerting system that \u2014 even separate from, to your point, the question of whether these games make you smarter. It\u2019s possible. There\u2019s some good evidence that brain games and staying engaged mentally is good for you. And then on the alerting side, even if you don\u2019t expect the game to improve your mind at all, we can still derive value from understanding what\u2019s happening with you and being able to intervene within the normal clinical system.", "GamesBeat: Is there a stage or an age where you think it\u2019s good to get this started, to be able to detect things happening with people? There\u2019s a certain stage where it seems like it may be too late to be helpful, but I don\u2019t know exactly what that might be.", "Wallaert:", " On the detection side, and even on the brain training side, people being engaged at any age is great. We can always make use of that data. You\u2019re right on \u2014 at some point, your cognition has declined enough that I don\u2019t think playing games is an effective way of combating that. Although there is anecdotal evidence out there that just being engaged in the world can be quite good.", "On the learning side, even if at this point you\u2019re quite demented \u2014 if your cognitive abilities have slipped quite far \u2014 even the alerting piece is quite good. Recognizing what\u2019s going on with people seeing sudden decline. Even if the game can\u2019t improve you, there are nice pieces to that. In a perfect world, where you and I got to design our Star Trek game of the future \u2014 if there was a game that followed you through your whole life, there are some very real potential possibilities there to be able to take longitudinal data.", "Think about it this way. If you start playing the game, that\u2019s my first detection point for you. I can watch if you decline after that, for sure, but I don\u2019t have a long history. Whereas if we can get people playing brain games earlier and earlier on, I know what you\u2019re normally like, and I know what you\u2019ve been like for a long period of time. I can detect more subtle changes. The longer the history of data I have, the more subtle the changes I can detect.", "Above: The MindMate app encourages good nutrition.", "GamesBeat: If you could get any data, what would be your sort of dream data for your purposes here, detecting mental decline?", "Wallaert:", " That\u2019s a hard question. Some of the MindMate data \u2014 certainly reaction time is really important data when we start talking about cognitive things. It\u2019s a good kind of canary in the coal mine for other stuff that might be going on. If you think about what happens in reaction time \u2014 as long as it\u2019s not purely automatic, the autonomic nervous system \u2014 many steps of cognition happen there. Often reaction time to language-based things is really good. Lots of parts of your brain are involved in processing that data. It\u2019s a good end-to-end detection mechanism.", "Memory is also good. I love some of the memory games that are available for that same reason. The ability to hold something in mind is also one of the things that \u2014 when it goes, it\u2019s not always transparently obvious. Looking at stages of dementia, it can be hard to tell the difference in someone who\u2019s genuinely abnormal, as opposed to the normal forgetfulness we all experience. We all sometimes struggle to remember the name of a song or something. How do you detect those changes?", "I will say that in many ways, it isn\u2019t just about the data for me as much as it\u2019s also about the ability to then go intervene. Much has been made of big data. Everybody\u2019s gone and put together giant data lakes and tried to make something out of that. But it\u2019s not helpful if you can\u2019t do something about it. The ability to have an on-premise nurse practitioner and medical assistant pairing that can go out to somebody\u2019s home and say, \u201cHey, let\u2019s check in.\u201d Having a field outreach team, having close connections with doctors \u2014 it\u2019s the full intervention loop that\u2019s really interest. Data alone doesn\u2019t do it.", "MindMate has the same data. Intrinsically it has all this data. But they don\u2019t have the ability to send someone to intervene, and we do. That\u2019s why the partnership makes sense. You have to have that full loop. It isn\u2019t just about data for me. It\u2019s about the dream system of being able to take that data and say to a doctor, \u201cWe saw this and you should check in on this the next time they come in,\u201d when they might not normally do that.", "GamesBeat: ", "I interviewed John DenBoer", " recently. He has this company called ", "Smart Brain Aging", " and the ", "BrainU", " online app. It\u2019s a competitor of sorts, another set of games for people with early dementia signs to play. One thing he said was interesting, though. He looked at some of the other games out there, like Lumosity, and he noted that a lot of their games were very repetitive. They would give the player the same kind of quiz each day.", "He argued that if you make someone use the brain in a different way every time they come back, that was a positive. You could otherwise see them get into a pattern where they only get better at one particular thing while the rest of their mind could still be in a state of decline. Sort of like, if you do a lot of crosswords you may get very good at crosswords, but your mind might not stay so sharp in other ways.", "Wallaert:", " I\u2019d push back on him a little bit on that one. What he\u2019s talking about, essentially, is the practice effect. The longer you do a task, the better you get at it, for sure. There should be, in theory, for any task \u2014 the more we do it, it should go up and to the right. He\u2019s saying that up and to the right might disguise a larger general decline.", "But remember, when we talk about something like dementia, we\u2019re talking about a neurological, biological decline. It\u2019s unlikely that the practice effect would mask it, and even if it did, you\u2019re not going to see substantial enough practice increases."], "spider_name": "venturebeat", "id": "venturebeat_post-2446936"}

The highlights were Spotify, LinkedIn, and then Adaptive Insights being acquired by Workday, just to name a few.", "VentureBeat: Did the year seem different to you in some ways? Have we seen any big changes happen?", "Howard:", " The last month has been pretty interesting. If you\u2019d asked me that about 45 days ago, I\u2019d say the market was like clockwork, but as you know, there\u2019s been a lot of turbulence in the financial markets lately. That\u2019s been the main difference of the year, quite frankly, how we\u2019re ending the year with a period of uncertainty and turbulence. Interest rates and yield curve inversion, things like that, have caused some turbulence. But the year has been exciting.", "VentureBeat: There\u2019s more worry around the bigger economic picture, for the world or the nation. Does that make you think differently about investments or startups? Does it have a bearing on what you do day to day?", "Howard:", " If you look through the areas that are creating introspection, I look at the yield curve inversion, which is pretty rare. The yield curve is a powerful thing. And I\u2019m looking at what\u2019s happened with China.

We\u2019ve been around for 58 years. We\u2019re established. We\u2019ve been through many recessions. We have a lot of institutional knowledge about how these things go.

We\u2019re in health care.", "The beauty of that is we have the flexibility to invest across all asset classes. For example, if you make an early stage investment today, it takes a couple of years to build the product, build the solution.

But what you\u2019ll end up seeing is valuations will probably come down for some companies. There\u2019s always a slight inequality. You sometimes see a concentration, whether it\u2019s WeWorks or Uber and Lyft. There are some companies that can raise capital, be high concentration. This can hugely impact some potential companies.

There will be a trickle-down effect for many companies on how to operate in that environment.", "VentureBeat: Do you think venture capital will be affected as a segment by economic changes in any particular way?", "Howard:", " There will be probably more interest in being on the early side of investing. You have a lower burn rate. You have an idea that\u2019s potentially newer. There will be adjustments, clearly. You\u2019ll see valuations potentially come down on the late stage. Liquidity, when there\u2019s an IPO or M&A, will probably be highly correlated with the public market comps.", "Now, there will always be companies that will trade and go public on the high end of the spectrum. There will be companies that will trade at the levels of public market comps. At the end of the day, things do trade for multiples of revenue or multiples of ARR or multiples of EBITDA. A lot of times that\u2019s correlated to the public markets. But there are always companies like Adaptive Insights, which we sold.

One or two years from now, the economic climate will be much different. It\u2019s hard to predict. You\u2019re usually built in on a value proposition for tomorrow, not today.

Since launching my fund almost a year ago, I\u2019ve learned that limited partners (LPs) will inevitably influence your firm\u2019s culture in one way or another \u2014 and I think a lot about how to manage this so that we nurture our community in a way that helps our portfolio companies feel safe and grow.", "For fund managers, an LP has much more influence than just cash in an account, especially in the early stages. For new managers, there\u2019s always a temptation to quickly raise money instead of raising the right money. I love fundraising and think the right LP set and structure is one of the most interesting things about managing a fund. Here are the key elements you should consider when choosing individual LPs or family offices for your fund.", "From the outset, it is critical to identify whether or not you as a fund manager and the potential LP share like-minded values. This includes, for example, your approach to decision-making and your relationship with truth. If you have doubts about the fit, it probably isn\u2019t a good match for the long term. If they like to lie and you don\u2019t, there\u2019s no point doing business together. That\u2019s not even because of ethics; it\u2019s because these relationships will crash. If they want to have control and you need independence, you\u2019ll also run into problems. Enter only relationships where your independence would be valued. For example, when choosing a limited partner, I first ask myself if I\u2019m ready to respond to their text messages within a few minutes for the next 10 years of my life.", "There is a reason I feel so strongly about the values of my LPs. The influence that a limited partner has on your culture can, and will, find its way into how you build and maintain relationships with your portfolio companies and will impact the types of teams you attract. Having particular investors in your network \u2014 and in your life, to be honest \u2014 will shape the dynamic, again and again. If a limited partner has negative values, or doesn\u2019t treat you well, that could rub off on you and how you relate to your own founders. Remember that these individuals became LPs because they are successful. When they enter your orbit, they give you a snippet of one version of success. Whether you realize it or not, you may begin to project different \u2014 and potentially contradictory \u2014 ways of thinking about success onto your portfolio. Another important thing to find out is their relationship with risk. It\u2019s important to make sure you\u2019re not pulled out of your comfort zone.", "My rule of thumb when working with founders is that if I don\u2019t understand them well enough to introduce them to other founders, or the media, I will not invest in them. I keep the same rule for LPs: In order to nurture a healthy culture, they must thoroughly understand us, and we must thoroughly understand them.", "What we do should not be perceived as magic to potential LPs who don\u2019t have a background in tech. Instead, as fund managers, we want to explain to them how venture capital works. Stepping outside of your comfort zone to better understand those who are different from you can result in unexpected partnerships that end up being the best, culturally, that you could hope for. The worst thing you can do is to sign up someone with a lack of knowledge about tech and venture. This is a path to nowhere as this person would not be helpful and can even harm your reputation not being able to explain why they made this investment.", "There is something to be said for partnering with the right LP at the wrong time. If the LP is the right fit culturally, but they just bought a house or made a major investment, perhaps it is not the right time. Even when I meet the right LP, I still ask myself if now is a good time based on what is currently going on in their life, or if I should be patient and wait a few months, or even one or two years. This has nothing to do with whether or not I\u2019m impressed by the person or the opportunity. It can simply come down to changing priorities and the curveballs that life throws at us. Realistically, immediately investing in your fund is not an urgent life priority in most cases. Give potential LPs as much time as they need instead of forcing them into a relationship with you and your fund.", "Don\u2019t close off relationships with people who choose not to become an LP. You would be surprised at how many great things you can accomplish together if you don\u2019t burn bridges every time someone doesn\u2019t immediately invest in you.", "Beta test your relationships. If you don\u2019t have any working experience with someone, try to do something small with them such as making an introduction or asking for feedback on your startup. See how they work and give them a chance to see how you work and think. Your direct experience working and collaborating with people is always the best way to find out if the relationship is going to work.", "The investor\u2019s culture influences their portfolio culture. Fund managers depending on the owner of the money to make decisions would be akin to editorial departments at media companies depending on the owners of companies to make decisions about what news they publish. Fund managers have to be independent; we get hired because we think differently, and this is how we help LPs come to the returns they want to receive. That special something in your approach to vetting companies or how you help portfolio companies grow should be based on shared values that enable you to add value to what the LP already has. If your investor sees opportunities in products for millennials and you\u2019re a millennial with an investment background and experience working with these kinds of products, then the value-add is clear. If they want to invest in e-commerce for females and you\u2019re a female with the right background, you would be a value-add.", "Ideally, you want to have a few investors with strategic expertise in the fields you\u2019re focused on and with access to valuable networks you don\u2019t yet have access to.", "Half of the success of any relationship is results; the other half is the experience you share in working towards your shared goal. It\u2019s important to work with limited partners who believe in this, too. When appropriate, and if the LP desires it, I\u2019ve seen how amazing it can be to grow partnerships through inviting LPs into new deals, involving them in the reviewing of portfolio opportunities, or making an introduction when it can be valuable for their main business. It\u2019s important to understand that your LPs hire you to do work for them, not to work for you. So make sure these activities are mutually desirable and interesting for them as well.", "Above all, perhaps, it\u2019s important to have LPs around you that you feel are developing you and making you better.", "In general, you want to have between 10 and 20 LPs for your first fund, but you really can\u2019t have too many investors. Keep in mind you need to be available to your investors and have time to share your work with them, and help them out when they\u2019re in need.", "The rules above helped me find investors who are extremely supportive. I couldn\u2019t have expected how it would be to work together and how many times their advice has saved us. A great partner will bring you knowledge, connections, and ideas that make you grow. If it turns out right, you\u2019ll get life-long partners and friends.", "Masha Drokova is Founder and General Partner at ", "Day One Ventures", "."], "spider_name": "venturebeat", "id": "venturebeat_post-2431215"}

Sponsorship is a big, big area of growth for esports. You\u2019re seeing, at the league level, great brands coming into esports like Toyota and T-Mobile and others. On the team level you\u2019re seeing big brands, both endemic brands and non-endemic brands, coming in and sponsoring teams and players.", "So you have media rights, sponsorship, and live events. Merchandise is another big area. You\u2019re starting to see that grow. There are some great esports teams doing a great job, whether that\u2019s 100 Thieves or Fnatic. And then the last area \u2013 and this is revenue that ultimately flows down mainly to the players \u2013 is prize winnings. Whether it\u2019s the player pool for the World Series that goes to the players, or the prize pools for League of Legends or DOTA or any other games, that money flows to the teams, and the majority ultimately goes to the players.", "From a revenue perspective, media, sponsorship, live events, merchandise, and prize winnings are the pillars. The biggest revenue driver to the leagues, currently, is media rights. What we\u2019re seeing today is that the largest revenue driver for the teams is sponsorship revenue.", "Above: Rob Chiarini, director of esports at Ubisoft.", "Takahashi: Robb, I guess we shouldn\u2019t forget that sales of games going directly to game publishers is a big part of this too.", "Chiarini:", " Yeah, exactly that. When we look at esports in the current revenue models, as he mentioned, we look at a lot at traditional sports. I\u2019d always say to look at traditional entertainment, too. Look at TV shows. At the end of the day, esports itself is a viewership phenomenon. There are players and all these mechanics within it, but it\u2019s no different from actors and players in other sports. We all agree that the viewership is what\u2019s super impressive. From viewership you get merchandise, people viewing and traveling and spending. That\u2019s where you get the buying power for sponsors and others.", "On top of that, for us, when we compare ourselves to traditional sports\u2014traditional sports had to go this rate. If you\u2019ve ever heard me talk about these things, I talk about how traditional sports have to sell media rights. They have to have sponsors. They have to have advertisers. They have to have all this influx of money, because they don\u2019t have anything, at the end of the day. They don\u2019t own the ball. You and I could start up a new football league tomorrow if we wanted to and no one can stop us from using that sport as a vehicle for a program. We\u2019d get our own sponsors, do our own things, and we could do anything we wanted. Nobody owns the IP of the football.", "With video games, we\u2019re in a very different place, in that we can look at things differently if we choose to. As many esports start up, they look at it going, hey, this is a marketing a vehicle, a messaging vehicle, an engagement vehicle, a community retention and engagement vehicle, rather than a P&L against a thing to provide an entertainment that creates profit. For us, owning the game gives us the opportunity that every activity we do, every dollar we spend on an esport, is actually a way for us to engage with our existing communities, create viewership, create playership, create opportunities for monetization within the game and on the game itself.", "All of that is super interesting. I believe esports has the biggest leg up against traditional sports in that way. Adding to that\u2014I agree with your list, merch and media rights and things. There are some other things that are interesting. Gambling is out there in the space, not that I\u2019m a proponent or otherwise, but that\u2019s a revenue stream that\u2019s out there in the world. Fantasy leagues, gambling sites, things like that. Another thing we do in esports, or in gaming in general, is interactive money. When you look at things like Twitch Bits and things of that nature that allow people to purchase around the game, that\u2019s different from the traditional sports. That\u2019s another revenue opportunity within the ecosystem, and for all of gaming.", "Takahashi: A lot of influencers out there are making a lot of money from esports-related live streams and other things.", "Chiarini:", " I go back to the drops and items and things inside the game, different layers of monetization. We\u2019d categorize that underneath gaming. But there\u2019s the whole other platform life. Twitch Bits is a good example, an external currency that\u2019s involved in the ecosystem. Somebody is spending to do things with that.", "Subscriptions are subscriptions. Move that to one side. It doesn\u2019t matter if you subscribe to Netflix, which is a very strong competitor to esports. Anything that takes eyeballs away from something else is a competitor. Not everyone looks at it that way, but I think gaming companies, esports companies, everyone of us is an entertainment medium and we should look at all of those spaces as potential threats. Subscription models are just another source of revenue.", "Above: Sponsorship is the biggest source of revenue for esports in 2018.", "Jonathan Singer:", " I have a little bit of a bomb to throw, which I feel is a good way to start off a panel. [laughs] That is, we talk about where the revenue is growing to. I think it\u2019s supposed to be $904 million this year and then a billion soon enough, with 380 million global viewers. That\u2019s a nice size of audience. But when you do the division there, you\u2019re talking about $2.60 a user.", "If you look at the companies that are coming in, you have all the big names in video games. You have big names from outside. Again, this is VentureBeat, so people are worried about the money. Is that enough money to go around? It\u2019s not a lot of money yet. I know we\u2019re growing as an industry, but when we\u2019re talking about revenue models, you have to talk about how we\u2019re getting there and how we get\u2014everyone\u2019s fighting for a slice of that pie.", "Wakeford:", " I think what you just framed up is one of the most exciting opportunities in esports. Goldman Sachs had a report recently where they showed that the average esports consumer monetized to about $3.94. Whereas the average consumer in traditional sports is monetizing to about $54. That means there\u2019s a 10X opportunity within the esports market to grow and build those connections with fans, to bring them things they\u2019re willing to pay for, for their excitement and their fandom and their engagement with teams and players. I view that as an opportunity.", "When I look at the revenue growth drivers in esports, I think they\u2019re all way under what the reality is going to be. We see it in the viewership. We see what\u2019s happening on a global basis with stadiums being built all around the world \u2013 in the U.S., in China, in Korea. We see brand sponsors coming in. We see bigger media rights deals happening. We see merchandise. We just saw the announcement with the Overwatch League and Fnatic doing merchandise. It\u2019s moving at a much faster speed than a lot of the industry reports have been putting out. That\u2019s the opportunity. That\u2019s why you see so much capital coming into esports.", "Chiarini:", " When we talk about esports, we\u2019re comparing this giant macro of a term, across a huge industry, multiple titles, multiple games, multiple sports if you will. It\u2019s a gigantic term we use to encompass everything. Different publishers, different games, different titles, these are all different points along that cycle. Some further along, some back behind. Some new, some starting, some growing. It\u2019s not equal across the board. We\u2019re talking from a very macro view. I think that\u2019s important, because I know some of the people watching are new to esports and trying to understand that. It encompasses so much when we talk about esports as a class.", "Takahashi: There are definitely winners and losers already at this stage in the game. Everyone saw the news that the H1Z1 league shut down in mid-season.", "Chiarini:", " I would never say that there are necessarily losers. Again, it\u2019s a strategy. Esports itself might not meet certain games and certain appetites for different things. They might feel that some other marketing strategy or activity that they\u2019re doing is more beneficial and this isn\u2019t proving out the results that they want. It\u2019s tough. What scope works for your game at that time, and things change.", "Singer:", " Kent\u2019s response was pitch perfect. What I was looking to get at, when you talk about the difference between the ARPPUs for esports and for traditional sports\u2013when you look at the demographics, if you look at baseball in the U.S., the bulk of their demographic is over 55 years old. Versus esports, it\u2019s millennials and Gen Z. You need to think about \u2014 we\u2019ll get to that in the next question as well \u2014 engagement, and how you\u2019re engaging with them from a technological standpoint, because these are the digital natives everyone in advertising has been talking about for years.", "How are they going to interact with esports? Where are they going to interact with esports? What do they expect from their viewing experience? That\u2019s where you see, as we move from traditional revenue models around the base that traditional sports built to future interesting revenue models Robb alluded to with perks and in-game currency, to other ways of interacting with fans. That\u2019s my point I want to make until we get to the next question.", "Above: Female esports players are on the rise.", "Takahashi: That\u2019s a good point. The perks part of streams, tips that happen in those streams, those are things that don\u2019t happen in the traditional sports revenue picture. That\u2019s something interesting about how much more digital the esports infrastructure is.", "Chiarini:", " You brought up age, the 55-year-old average age of baseball viewers. All of our esports fans are growing older too. As they mature and raise families on esports, just like previous generations did on baseball\u2013not that I\u2019m saying baseball is going away, but we\u2019re starting to see legacy now like traditional sports have had. Your parents may have been sports fans, so they took you to games and you became a fan. We\u2019re seeing that same thing happen with esports. Even for us, for all of us looking at esports now, and what that demographic is\u2013as it\u2019s aging and maturing, what\u2019s the value proposition for those people, as well as new fans? It\u2019s going to be an exciting elongated process for that.", "Singer:", " Just to make sure, Robb, Ubisoft isn\u2019t bringing up a public stance that they\u2019re going to kill baseball.", "Chiarini:", " Uh\u2026no? I think there\u2019s enough room for everyone, for all these games, for the different sportsballs and everything else. There\u2019s plenty of room for everyone, an appetite for each of us.", "Takahashi: We\u2019ve gone into a bit of this already, but what lessons can be learned, both positive and negative, so far? Traditional sports lessons, but other lessons as well.", "Wakeford:", " As a team owner, I think there\u2019s a lot of great lessons from traditional sports. There\u2019s a lot of areas to innovate, especially with the digital connection between fan and player. We talked about a lot of the traditional revenue streams and media. There\u2019s a lot of room for improvement in looking at how traditional sports have been able to really engage fans in broadcast and go deep into player backgrounds and create a connection with storytelling around players. You\u2019ll see that emerge in this coming year in esports.", "Sponsorship we touched on. The gates are open and that\u2019s happening. Another big area is live events. As I mentioned before, there are stadiums and arenas opening up all around the United States and the world for esports events. You\u2019ll see a lot of innovation in how events are put on and engage people to come and have a great time. And then merchandise is another area that traditional sports teams have done a great job with. You\u2019ll see that evolve.", "One other area that\u2019s also evolving, and we\u2019ve spent a lot of time on this at Gen.G\u2013we planted a flag in South Korea, the birthplace of esports. If you think about a lot of the players within esports, so many of them are from Korea. It\u2019s like Brazil in soccer in terms of so many great players coming out of South Korea. What you\u2019re seeing now is a whole infrastructure being built around the trading of players. That\u2019s another area of revenue that you\u2019ll start to see. Whether you look at the soccer teams or other professional teams, you\u2019ll see trading of players become another big area of growth. As an esports team owner, I\u2019m looking a lot at traditional sports for best practices in that area.", "Chiarini:", " As I alluded to earlier, monetize everything. Traditional sports, they do a great job of every potential revenue source around the thing they create and how to monetize that, how to build upon that. To Kent\u2019s point, how do we create deeper connections with fans, through storytelling and other pieces of content? How do you tell the story and own this ecosystem that you\u2019ve created? Some of the traditional sports team and sports leagues do a great job of revealing that humanity that we all can connect to and do something with that."], "spider_name": "venturebeat", "id": "venturebeat_post-2430328"}

Instead it\u2019s, \u201cWhat critical feedback do I need to make potential customers ready to buy?\u201d Rigorous testing with beta partners who are good proxies (or even prospects) for customers will quickly shape an MVP into a market-ready product. Then it\u2019s time to accelerate growth.", "Hiring a U.S. sales lead is a particularly daunting task for non-U.S. entrepreneurs without a pre-existing network. The variance in effort needed to make this critical hire is huge, and the process can take months. CEOs will often delay here, believing they can handle sales themselves (especially if they are good at it), but delegating daily sales responsibility is a precondition for scaling meaningfully.", "The job headline should be: great operator with potential to grow into a manager. The priority is to secure the first 3-5 paying customers in order to secure a great Series A round. A common mistake is hiring an experienced VP of Sales who can run a global team but hasn\u2019t had to operate solo in years. At this stage, startups can survive (even thrive) with someone who isn\u2019t a manager but can hustle and close deals on her own \u2013 the opposite is untrue.", "The U.S. sales lead needs to be scrappy and resourceful. Initially, look for someone with real hustle and a strong, relevant network. Culture and fit are also crucial. The U.S. salesperson must work with leadership closely, yet operate remotely. Experience in a similar role is ideal. Great chemistry is a must. As everything comes together, it will be time to raise additional capital to scale.", "I\u2019m often asked: \u201cHow much revenue do I need to get to a Series A raise?\u201d That\u2019s an oversimplified question. Providing a number is arbitrary because good Series A investors look far deeper than revenue. And while there is an argument for pursuing quick wins to start appealing to Series A investors, customers are only a proxy for the real objective \u2014 building sustainable business momentum. Yes, we say winning 3-5 customers is important, but so is the type of customers you have, the robustness of the pipeline, the partner and channel relationships you\u2019re cultivating, the quality of the team, the maturity of the product, and the roadmap to scale.", "Informal introductions to Series A investors should start as early as customer discovery. You don\u2019t want your first conversation with a potential Series A investor to be the one where you\u2019re asking them for money! These conversations, independent of investment, will grant valuable perspective on your product and naturally expand your network.", "Each ", "journey from seed to A", " will vary, presenting different challenges depending on the team and market. The key is balancing the need for short-term wins while pursuing the ultimate vision as you progress from an idea on a napkin to a growing company with paying customers.

It\u2019s the first on the market to combine lidar and camera data at the hardware level, AEye says.", "The bulk of the research on iDar was spearheaded by Dr. Allan Steinhardt, whose career includes a stint at\u00a0DARPA, where he researched space, terrestrial, and naval-based radar systems, and at Booz Allen Hamilton, where he served as a vice president and chief scientist.

The TechStars London 2016 alumnus today announced a $1.8 million funding round led by S28 Capital, with participation from Acequia Capital and Force Over Mass.", "Taylor and Mouysset \u2014 who met nearly 20 years ago while studying computer science at Cambridge \u2014 said the goal from the start was to develop an algorithm-driven platform that could minimize waste by predicting how much food a store will sell on any given day.", "\u201cI\u2019d ask a sales manager how much a store was going\u00a0to make next Monday, and\u00a0they\u2019d be like, \u2018Probably the same as last Monday.\u2019 That\u2019d be despite the fact that there was a holiday, or that\u00a0that\u00a0the weather or the\u00a0season was changing, and that actually, they were going to make a lot more or less than what they were expecting,\u201d Taylor told VentureBeat in a phone interview.\u00a0\u201cThey\u00a0were making the wrong forecast\u00a0because they were not looking at this data \u2014 because it was just so fragmented and all over the place. They\u00a0needed something that\u00a0could tie it\u00a0all together.\u201d", "Toward that end, Tenzo\u2019s system focuses on four core areas: sales, labor costs, inventory spending, and customer feedback. By taking into account data from a range of pipelines \u2014 including account sale, weather, social media reviews, and employee performance through platforms like Lightspeed, Bizimply, Deputy, Google Places, and more \u2014 it\u2019s able to deliver insights to restaurants\u2019 managerial staff through an app for iOS and Android and a web dashboard.", "Above: Tenzo\u2019s web dashboard.", "\u201cWhat we\u2019ve done is built something that connects\u00a0[multiple data]\u00a0sources and delivers that on mobile,\u201d Taylor told VentureBeat.\u00a0\u201cAnd we\u2019re not just making that data available \u2014 we\u2019re actually analyzing it, and notifying users by\u00a0pushing them an alert\u00a0saying things like, \u2018Hey, by the way, you know, on Tuesday, between three and six, you\u2019re constantly overspending on labor,\u2019\u00a0or, \u2018You know, you haven\u2019t ordered enough given the forecast for tomorrow.'\u201d", "Specifically, Tenzo\u2019s AI \u2014 which he and\u00a0Mouysset claim is\u00a0up to 50 percent more accurate than traditional forecasting methods and can boost gross margin up to 18 percent \u2014 tracks sales on a per-employee basis and automatically forecasts changes, helping managers settle on an optimal operating schedule and find the right balance of delivery and in-store staff. Additionally, there\u2019s a social component that keeps abreast of online buzz (on Yelp, Twitter, Facebook, and TripAdvisor) across store locations and alerts staff when a customer posts a review.", "One extra star of social media rating has been shown to drive 7 percent of additional revenue,\u00a0Mouysset told VentureBeat.", "\u201cReal-time data and machine learning are tempting restaurants with a radically new future,\u201d Kent Ho, partner at S28 Capital, said. \u201cTenzo is building the critical technology that provides actionable intelligence to operate with certainty. I\u2019m very excited to work with [them] as they scale the core technology that will fuel the next generation of restaurants.\u201d", "Tenzo isn\u2019t the first to tackle the food waste problem with AI, of course. AgShift uses computer vision to autonomously inspect produce and other commodities for defects, and London startup Karma\u2019s app connects users with over 1,500 businesses offering surplus meals. Mintscraps and LeanPath, meanwhile, both offer real-time tracking solutions for restaurants.", "But Tenzo has momentum on its side. To date, it has signed on customers across 700 physical locations in the U.K., U.S., and Ireland, and France, including The Breakfast Club, Iberica, Camile Thai, Mitchells\u00a0& Butlers, and Nando\u2019s UK and South Africa. And already, according to Mouysset, several of its customers have been able to reduce staff costs by 10 percent and food wastage by 28 percent.", "\u201cWhen you have all of this data,\u00a0you can start looking at other\u00a0things, like\u00a0instances of employee fraud,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u00a0could look at volumes of\u00a0cash transactions and credit card transactional average transaction sizes, and see how that evolves over time\u00a0where different people are working. We even have people starting to build on top of [Tenzo] for auto-ordering and inventory replenishment.\u201d"], "spider_name": "venturebeat", "id": "venturebeat_post-2412740"}
