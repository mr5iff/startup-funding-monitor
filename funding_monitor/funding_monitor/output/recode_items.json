Education programs and discounts for K-12 education and college students have helped Apple to drive far higher share among both schools and students than among the broader population. It\u2019s not uncommon to see entire college lecture halls filled with glowing Apple logos with few Windows laptops to be seen, in a reversal of the previous pattern. IPads, in turn, have been at the center of Apple\u2019s recent programs in schools, with many school districts purchasing large numbers of iPads for use by students in the classroom.", "Also more recently, Google has made significant inroads with Chromebooks, which haven\u2019t sold nearly as well in other settings.

It makes sense. The payments company has a well-known CEO and founder in tech star Jack Dorsey. It has raised a giant sum of money \u2014 more than $200 million in equity financing \u2014 from big names, including Sequoia Capital, Visa and Starbucks. It has an ambitious and perhaps overreaching plan to disrupt a massive industry of powerful old-school players like First Data to younger payments giants such as PayPal. No surprise then, the question of where Square is headed has dominated the chatter in industry circles. And news that the company ", "secured a revolving credit line", " of about $200 million has only ratcheted up the intrigue. Let\u2019s try for some clarity then, answering some of the outstanding questions about the startup.", "The most-asked question, of course, is whether Square is for sale or not. And that answer depends on what you mean by for sale. In the last year, both Apple and Google have considered making acquisition offers for Square, according to industry sources familiar with the situation. (The Information ", "previously reported", " Google\u2019s consideration.) That makes sense, but it\u2019s still unclear if it was more than a typical business development exercise.", "In recent weeks, though, acquisition rumors have run rampant for Square, including chatter among its competitors, with Google being named as the most likely acquirer. This kind of stuff is common in Silicon Valley, but no firm offers have been made so far and people close to the management team at Square said the company is not actively trying to sell the company.", "That said, an offer in the $8 billion range \u2014 which would mark more than a 50 percent premium over the $5 billion valuation Square secured during a recent secondary offering \u2014 would get Dorsey and the board\u2019s attention, one of these people said. One problem: Industry sources say Square doesn\u2019t currently have anywhere near the business case to support such a rich offer. Then again, there was the WhatsApp acquisition by Facebook at $19 billion, a strategic move that most definitely required paying up. It would make sense for Google to be\u00a0the most interested buyer, because it would want more information on purchases that consumers make, both to help prove how well its ads work and to perhaps better target those ads to individuals. This is part of the reason why it introduced Google Wallet, which has yet to become widely used for in-store payments.", "Either way, a sale to Google would disappoint Dorsey, according to multiple people familiar with his thinking. For one, he was reportedly put off by Google after being involved in acquisition talks between his former company, Twitter, and the search giant. He also believes, sources said, that Square\u2019s design aesthetic and values match up much more closely with Apple than Google. That\u2019s not surprising when you consider that Square\u2019s hardware chief Jesse Dorogusker worked at Apple for more than eight years. He most recently was a director of engineering for the iPod, iPhone and iPad accessories, according to his LinkedIn profile. Apple has also sold Square products in its stores, most recently the Square Stand. \u201cJack does not want to sell to Google,\u201d one source said flatly.", "Is Apple another story? ", "Re/code", " ", "recently reported", "\u00a0that\u00a0Apple is exploring ways to use its software and devices to help people shop both digitally and in physical stores. Square would immediately give Apple built-in distribution at thousands of businesses that use it to manage their payments. A deal with Apple could mean that Square could stop worrying about getting adoption for Square Wallet. Apple already has hundreds of millions of credit cards on file through its iTunes service and could use those, along with its digital wallet, Passbook, as the underpinnings of its own mobile-payments offering for consumers. CEO Tim Cook, without confirming the initiative, talked up the opportunity on Apple\u2019s recent earnings call. \u201cYou can tell by looking at the demographics of our customers, and the amount of commerce that goes through iOS devices versus the competition, that it\u2019s a big opportunity on the platform,\u201d he said at the time.", "But Apple\u2019s entrance into mobile payments is much more likely to start with services that use its iPhones to help make online purchases easier to consummate rather than moving into offline payments, industry sources say. Square wouldn\u2019t be of much help in that regard. As such, Apple has soured on the idea of making an acquisition offer to Square for now, according to sources familiar with the company\u2019s thinking. Other potential acquirers could pop up in the future, but those two companies seem like the most likely landing spots, according to industry observers and people close to Square. Spokespeople for Apple and Square declined to comment. Google has not yet responded to our query.", "With both Apple and Google looking like long-shot acquirers for now, many industry observers still believe that Square\u2019s eventual exit will happen via an IPO. While it seemed at some point like 2014 was potentially the year Square would test the public markets, people familiar with the company\u2019s thinking doubt that\u2019s now the case. One problem the company is facing is that the revenue it makes from payment processing is still the vast majority of sales, while other revenue-generating products have either not yet launched or not yet taken off. For example, the company slashed the price of its Square Stand tablet holder from $299 to $99 within months of its launch, hinting at either bad pricing estimates or lower than expected demand. Square\u2019s search for diversification has also ", "led it to what some consider a controversial offering", ": Merchant cash advances. But that\u2019s untethered from Square\u2019s core payments business and would provide higher profit margins should it launch out of its pilot program.", "The problem with being so dependent on processing revenue is twofold: First, the profit margins aren\u2019t great. Competition and the commoditization of payment pipes have driven down the fees payments companies charge merchants, while the cut paid out to credit card companies has remained largely the same. Secondly, the public markets today would likely be forced to value Square at a lower revenue multiple than if it made revenue from software sales, which typically come with better profit margins.", "Square knows this. It has been working to introduce other software tools to help merchants run their businesses that it hopes it can package into a subscription offering, according to several people familiar with the company\u2019s plans. Square\u2019s acquisition of BookFresh, a maker of business booking software, hints at this future, for example. Another tool could help stores manage their inventory, something that some young point-of-sale competitors like ShopKeep already provide.", "These initiatives would fall under the leadership of Gokul Rajaram, the product engineering lead Square poached last summer from Facebook. Rajaram is a well-respected product leader; his hire nine months ago was widely seen as a coup for Dorsey\u2019s company. His group is also said to be working on data analytics products to offer to Square\u2019s merchants.", "Now, the industry is waiting for the work his team has been doing to be released publicly. If the additional small business offerings see the light of day and achieve some success, Square could convince acquirers or the public markets to value it more as a software company or at least a hybrid payments/software/data company, likely increasing its value. Such new products would also be seen as a way to boost profit margins at the company.", "Sources say Square registered somewhere between $500 million and $600 million in gross sales in 2013. But the majority of that gets passed back to credit card companies, leaving Square with net revenue of between $100 million and $200 million. This year, Square is hiring salespeople to go after mid-sized retailers as well, as part of an initiative led by ", "new business lead Francoise Brougher", ".", "Up until\u00a0now, Square has attempted to build products for consumers, with the thinking that more consumer adoption will convince more retailers to sign up for Square\u2019s payments service. While logical, the consumer side of Square\u2019s business has undoubtedly been less successful than the merchant side. Square Wallet, the iPhone app that allows shoppers to pay for things at Square merchants without using a credit card or cash, hasn\u2019t taken off as expected, which is an industry problem more than a Square problem. So-called digital wallets, in general, haven\u2019t succeeded, since they aren\u2019t any quicker to use than a physical card or cash and haven\u2019t given shoppers enough value to switch over. And no one digital wallet has enough adoption on the merchant side to convince shoppers they can leave their real wallet at home and visit a variety of stores in a day that all accept payments by phone. Square Wallet does not currently rank in the Top 200 free Finance apps in Apple\u2019s Appstore. The company\u2019s new ", "money-transfer app Square Cash", " ranks 51st. And Square\u2019s new e-commerce marketplace, Square Market, faces the daunting task of going up against established marketplaces for small-business sellers such as Etsy, not to mention giant online marketplaces run by Amazon and eBay.", "So while a Square IPO might seem inevitable, pulling one off in 2014 would likely be tough.", "You can\u2019t talk about Square\u2019s future without wondering what it might look like if the company\u2019s ", "much-hyped deal with Starbucks", " had gone differently. Inked in the summer of 2012, the arrangement consisted of three main parts: Square would process payments for debit and credit card purchases at Starbucks stores; Starbucks would invest $25 million into Square; and Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz joined Square\u2019s board of directors.", "The benefit to Starbucks was that Square would charge it a lower payment processing fee than it had previously been paying. Over time, such an arrangement had the potential to save Starbucks millions of dollars. It was not meant to be a money-maker for Square, and a person familiar with the deal hinted that Square may have actually been losing money on the arrangement at some point. In exchange, Starbucks helped put Square on the map and bolster its credibility. After all, what startup payments company besides Square had such a giant, wildly popular customer? None. It was a huge win by that measure. \u201cThe Starbucks relationship early on was a big coup for the company,\u201d said a person familiar with the deal.", "But the inking of the deal may have been the high point. The companies announced on Halloween of last year that ", "Schultz would step down from Square\u2019s board", " after a little over a year, making room for former Goldman Sachs chief financial officer David Viniar. The reason, the companies said, was that Schultz had planned a year-long tenure from the start. But many industry observers thought the move odd, given the depth of the relationship.", "For sure, there was more Square was hoping to get out of the arrangement, according to people familiar with the deal. For one, Square expected the deal to help the company promote its Square Wallet phone app. When customers pay through Square Wallet, they, in turn, become a customer of Square, giving the company more data to inform new products. Square also believed that increased consumer adoption would help convince more retailers to sign up for Square\u2019s payments service. It\u2019s not clear why Square thought it would, since Starbuck\u2019s own mobile app has found tremendous success and allows customers to pay through it.", "The conversations around the deal also seemed to leave Square believing that there was a decent chance Starbucks or some of its other brands would end up converting some business to Square\u2019s point-of-sale software rather than just having Square handle the payment processing on the back end, according to the person familiar with the deal. That, Square believed, would be a huge stamp of approval that would help it drum up business from other huge brands. But it has not happened.", "That failure means more than ever that Square\u2019s future rests solely in its own hands. Many fast-growth private companies have secured debt financing ahead of an IPO, leading some people to believe a Square public markets debut is on the horizon. At the same time, other industry sources have suggested Square simply chose to take on debt because it made more financial sense than potential equity deals available to it. Taking on debt can make a lot of sense for profitable businesses, but is more risky for unprofitable operations. And, according to sources, like many such startups, Square is not yet profitable."]}

It went on to provide information about how to sign up for free credit monitoring and \u201cidentity theft protection insurance where available.\u201d", "Target issued a press release announcing this second group of stolen data on January 10. My wife\u2019s email arrived a full week later on January 17. In the interim, it is not far-fetched to imagine a scenario where cyber criminals could have used the stolen email address to send her a so-called \u201cphishing\u201d email designed to look like one from Target with the intent of luring more personal information out of her.", "What\u2019s worse: while theft of this type of personal information alone does not necessitate public disclosure according to most state laws, the fact that criminals potentially had this information coupled with our credit card data since we had shopped at a Target during the affected timeframe was enough to cause alarm.", "So why such a delay between the initial press release and the email from the company? Was Target following the letter of the law with the timing of this disclosure? How about the initial breach notification? Was that made in the appropriate timeframe?", "The truth is: It is almost impossible to know because of the current patchwork nature of data breach disclosure laws in this country, and the lack of one unified one at the federal level.", "Forty-six states currently have data breach disclosure laws on the books, but most of them provide vague guidance on how quickly the public needs to be notified and what mediums should be used first for notification.

The nation is in desperate need of federal legislation that sets standardized ground rules.\u00a0Such a law would likely not prevent such data attacks, but it would give businesses a clear understanding of what kind of breaches require disclosure and over which channels of communications.

Sen. Toomey\u2019s spokeswoman E.R. Anderson was not immediately reachable.", "On Wednesday, Senators Tom Carper and Roy Blunt introduced a similar bill, called the Data Security Act of 2014.

But she defended the decision to first disclose the theft of the two data groups via a press release before contacting individual shoppers, saying Target wanted to \u201cget out to as many [customers] as quickly as possible.\u201d", "After releasing the press release about the second group of stolen data \u2014 the personal information theft \u2014 on Friday, the 10th, Snyder said Target started sending out tens of millions of emails the following week.", "\u201cWe\u2019ve been moving as swiftly as possible to notify guests through a variety of channels,\u201d she said.", "\u201cWe\u2019re obviously committed to meeting our legal obligation, but that\u2019s not our goal,\u201d she added. \u201cOur No.1 goal is reaching our guests.\u201d"]}

But you have to think of it in the context of the team and the market opportunity the team is going after. So as I sat there way back when we invested $5 million in the first round, it was rooted in the idea that commerce has not been innovated on in a long, long time. Amazon has a disproportionate share of the market and many, many others continue to grow. But we haven\u2019t seen a real type of disruptive innovation in e-commerce after 20 years of massive growth that started when Amazon started.", "The best analog we can think of was when Walmart appeared to be eating the world of retail and here comes this little company called Costco with the club format \u2026 there was enough market for both of them.

Because this is an idea that takes a significant amount of capital to get out of the gate.", "Why?", "The big retailers have some scale advantage over the little guys. The scale advantage kicks in at about $1 billion in gross merchandise volume. At that level, you can have three fully operating warehouses and be within three days of everyone with ground shipping.

In the 10 steps in the shopping mission, only one of the 10 is UPS or FedEx bringing it to the door. The other nine things are where Jet interactions are going to dominate. There\u2019s the experience the consumer is going to have on the tablet and mobile and desktop with Jet, and the follow-up, and the feeling of savings that\u2019s going to overwhelm the experience.", "Marc is the first tell you, it\u2019s a matter of nines and 10s. Every consumer rating needs to be a nine or 10 going forward.", "Would you have invested in this idea with a different CEO?", "There\u2019s another online shopping club model and we decided not to invest in it a year ago or so. But what you\u2019re dealing with here with Jet is that Marc is a guy a number of investors have very long-term relationships with. Ours is newer, but we\u2019ve known Marc and folks on his team since Diapers.com, when I tried to recruit several members into our portfolio companies.", "There are certainly some other entrepreneurs in the universe as talented as Marc, but he happens to be the one human being with his level of talent to think the big picture, be able to sell the dream, and also to be maniacally into the details, which is a rare skill as it applies to online retail.", "If we talk five years from now and Jet didn\u2019t pan out, what will be the reason why?", "It\u2019s really about execution at this point. If the system doesn\u2019t work \u2026", "Are you talking about the pricing system that helps determine which discounts which shoppers will get?", "I\u2019m talking about that exactly. Every other aspect of business, it\u2019s\u00a0hard to imagine why even if we make mistakes, we can\u2019t improve over time and recover. Customer acquisition, we know how that works, for example. All of that stuff to me is blocking and tackling. The differentiation to succeed is delivering savings: If it works in real time like we say it\u2019s going to work.", "I reported a few months ago that Lore said Jet could have a $500 million marketing budget over the next five years. Is the majority of funding going to that budget?", "I don\u2019t think that\u2019s 100 percent right.

Amazon could be pushing back the free trial dates because it hasn\u2019t built up enough demand in these areas to start charging for the service.

What percentage of the stock of a given product ends up getting returned?", "\u201cThen you can make an automated price decision to maximize some objective,\u201d he said.", "Boomerang is also testing technology to assist online retailers in decisions about what products to carry and how many.

People really want their DNA, and I also see the engagement of our customers is phenomenal. At least over 40 percent of customers are coming back on a quarterly basis. We have spectacular numbers of people who are coming back, which to me just begs that they want to do more. I think for me this is an opportunity. The mission of 23andMe is not just about genetics. We have research, and again, all of that which is already a big mission, but we really want to transform health care.", "I think that there\u2019s a huge opportunity for the consumer to have a voice. People want to engage. People want to learn about themselves. They want to be healthier. They want to know more what they can do. I feel like I now have this responsibility to tell you, \u201cI told you you\u2019re high risk for Alzheimer\u2019s, you\u2019re high risk for Parkinson\u2019s, you\u2019re high risk for a stroke. I told you really meaningful information about yourself. Now I need to help you execute on your life.\u201d I think that\u2019s where, when I think about the potential of raising this capital, it\u2019s about we want to expand, and I think that there\u2019s a real opportunity to think about an affordable consumer-centric health care system.", "LG: In earlier interviews, you\u2019ve talked about the challenges in just getting people to accept this idea, of sending in a saliva sample and having their DNA information live in a database somewhere. We\u2019ve compared it to the early days of Amazon when people weren\u2019t necessarily comfortable shopping online and now it\u2019s this huge thing. Do you still see that as a challenge? And what do you have to do to get to that point where it\u2019s Amazon-like where everyone just does it?", "I think it\u2019s still a challenge, but I see it breaking, and I think that\u2019s to me ... The exciting point of right now is, I think that when you start to see the types of numbers and the types of volume that we\u2019re getting, you see that there\u2019s an opportunity for broad acceptance.", "LG: Why is that?", "I think we\u2019re 11-and-a-half years old. In part, there\u2019s a question of time and I think that there\u2019s enough stories out there. I was sitting in the lobby and someone walked up to me and was like, \u201cYou changed my life\u201d with one of the old health care reports that we used to have, and she\u2019s like, \u201cI tell everyone about it now and how much it had an impact on me.\u201d I think that you get enough people around this country ...", "KS: Here at the office, Sally Kuchar was looking at it and talking about 23andMe while I was getting a soda. I was like, \u201cOh the founder\u2019s here.\u201d It was funny.", "It comes up all the time how much it is truly impacting peoples\u2019 lives either from an ancestry component or from a health component. I think that there\u2019s some element of just this critical mass. ", "KS: People do understand the concept now a lot. You were one of the first to introduce it, on a popular ...", "Correct.", "KS: ... on a consumer basis, really. You did have a lot of stumble. Last time we spoke, you had been just finishing wrangling with the FDA over what you could reveal and what you couldn\u2019t and how they classify medical devices. Give us an update of where that is because you had stumbled and had done the proper paperwork you needed to do.", "We did. We were classified as a medical device, and we thought we were a laboratory developed test, so we have been going through the process with the FDA. We have now two FDA clearances. The first one was for carrier status, and the second one was for genetic health risks. We don\u2019t have everything back yet, but we have at least a path where I know that we\u2019ll be able to get more of those reports back that we want.", "KS: How do you interact with the FDA?", "Frequently.", "KS: What is their attitude now? I know we had talked about them being slow, a lot of ", "people I talk to \u2014 Vic Gundotra", " \u2014 there\u2019s this slowness of the change in regulatory.", "Well, I\u2019ve always said, the FDA speaks data. Sometimes it can take a while to generate data. You have to prove it\u2019s safe. You have to prove it\u2019s accurate. One of the big leaps for us is we have an FDA clearance that does not require a physician or a genetic counselor. We all recognize this in health care, that there\u2019s this assumption that you need supervision on your behaviors and your actions. We feel it\u2019s really important to make things direct to consumer because it just makes it cheaper and more affordable and accessible. ", "We had to prove to the FDA that people can get this information without the oversight of a physician or genetic counselor, and that actually took a lot. That\u2019s all about the product and showing that any education level can understand it and that they can grasp the key concepts. You get an Alzheimer\u2019s report or a Parkinson\u2019s report, that you know what to do with that information.", "LG: When you said that you haven\u2019t gotten it all back yet, what does that mean exactly? Someone sends in their sample and what can you do and what can\u2019t you do?", "We don\u2019t do all the interpretation back yet that we used to do. We used to do also cancer testing as well as drug response. Those are two categories as well as a bunch of preliminary research. There\u2019s a bunch of report categories that we don\u2019t have yet. We have to get approvals with the FDA on those.", "LG: Is that something you\u2019re working towards?", "I call them all my children. Yes, I want all my children back.", "LG: What kind of timeline are you looking at for that to happen? How does that work?", "That\u2019s one thing with the FDA, you can\u2019t ever really necessarily predict, but we\u2019re working on it. ", "KS: Has this changed with this idea of consumers taking control? Has that changed as the administration has come in and attempted to dismantle ACA? Has it impacted your business?", "I\u2019d say the thing at the FDA is a lot of the people who we interact with ...", "KS: Are the same people.", "... it\u2019s the same people. I think that there\u2019s ... People see that there\u2019s this environment, that Trump\u2019s not coming out and trying to put new regulations out there, but we work with the same people that we have always worked with. There\u2019s a process.", "KS: Head of the FDA doesn\u2019t matter necessarily?", "We know Scott Gottlieb. He was out here. We\u2019re big fans of what he\u2019s done because I think he knows enough about Silicon Valley to understand some of the innovation and the potential, but he also understands and respects drug development and safety and the needs. The reality is, the FDA is there to make sure that we\u2019re using products that are safe. I have a lot of respect for what they do, and I also see there are a lot of bad actors out there, and I see that even in my space, there\u2019s a lot of genetic information that is not great, not well validated. I see the need for them. ", "I think that he\u2019ll have a good balance. I think that\u2019s why I was actually happy when I saw he was appointed because I think he\u2019s balanced.", "LG: One of the things that we\u2019ve talked about a lot lately on the show, and I mentioned this earlier, is the consumer taking more control of their own health care. We\u2019ve talked about Eutropics, we\u2019ve talked about fasting, we\u2019ve talked about consumer wearables. Kara calls them unwearables. I like to test wearables, so we differ on that topic. We\u2019ve talked about these fancy additive health clinics. A lot of this is centered, it seems, in Silicon Valley and some other metropolitan areas as well. What do you think about Silicon Valley\u2019s obsession with this idea of, I don\u2019t know, controlling their own destinies in some way when it comes to health?", "KS: And where is it, too?", "LG: And possibly trying to stave off death?", "I\u2019ve read the articles. There\u2019s definitely this movement of wow, we must solve death. I think we\u2019re very much focused on the mainstream.", "KS: Your companies?", "Yeah, 23andMe. I think the reality is that death is just the reality for us. I\u2019m sure some of my peers will be unhappy to that statement, but it seems relatively real. For me, the beauty of what is so interesting out there is like everyone can agree, there\u2019s genes and environment. Your genes dictate a certain element, but you have this huge variability in your environment. For me, it\u2019s I guess people. If we can understand what variables are really important, then you can potentially live the most optimal life. If you know you\u2019re high risk, likely to be a Type I diabetic, are there things in your environment that you can potentially alter to not then develop it?", "A lot of these things are potentially preventable if you actually know what you can change. For me, one of the big elements of 23andMe is doing that kind of prevention research. Is that if I get tons of people together and I can actually collect ... Wearables are really interesting to me not just because it\u2019s a single wearable, but en masse, if we can actually all start to look at environmental data, exercise data, sleep data, you can start to triage and understand how much do these things really have an impact, and you\u2019re going to have to follow them for a long time. ", "KS: Let\u2019s talk about two parts of that. One is privacy and the other is, is it a business. Now there\u2019s been a lot of health care startups lately. There\u2019s Color, EKGs, all kind of different areas in your topics. ", "LG: There\u2019s Theranos.", "KS: Theranos, yes. We talked to you about that. We\u2019re not going to talk about it anymore. Actually Theranos is in that direction, the idea of making affordable testing and different things that seem too complicated. Let\u2019s talk first about the business of it because there hasn\u2019t been, I\u2019m not going to say a Facebook of health, but where is that? Where is that happening? Do you imagine there has been?", "What I\u2019m excited about with our round is it has taken us 11 years to get this kind of critical mass.", "KS: Right.", "There\u2019s not a Facebook of health. We\u2019re getting to that point where I can say I have critical mass finally. I look at all of these great souls out here in Silicon Valley and around the world who are trying to make really innovative changes in health care. ", "It\u2019s hard because health care is spectacularly fragmented. An oncology team at Stanford doesn\u2019t do the same things as an oncology team at Memorial Sloan Kettering and to protect it under the Practice of Medicine, and they have different ways that they engage with their patients. Everything is spectacularly fragmented. ", "For us, one of the things that I\u2019m really proud of that we saw is I have millions of people now on a single platform that I know are all interested in their DNA and their health. I think there\u2019s a huge potential for us to help, again, engage all of our customers and potentially work with all of the innovative tech companies out here and give them a platform. ", "KS: Tech has not solved health, and in fact, right now the senate is struggling with yet another version of repealing Obamacare.", "Right.", "KS: Making this a business, how difficult is it? ", "It\u2019s difficult. I think you have two paths in health care. Either you look at the reimbursement laws or the rules out there, and you say, \u201cThis is how I make money.\u201d", "KS: I get reimbursed.", "You say, \u201cI know that I can get reimbursed in this kind of channel. Therefore, I\u2019m going to offer these services.\u201d What\u2019s hard that we have done, people aren\u2019t used to this idea that they\u2019re going to pay for their own health care. There\u2019s not a consumer marketplace in health care outside of just the wellness like yoga, vitamins.", "KS: Right, which is very spendy.", "Which is good. It\u2019s a $300 billion market.", "KS: Yeah, very spendy.", "It\u2019s definitely a big market. Actually making that change, that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to crack, specifically. It is really hard. I empathize. Every year when I go to Health 2.0 or I was just at TechCrunch, it\u2019s hard. You got a lot of these souls really trying to make a difference and it\u2019s hard. That\u2019s why there\u2019s no one out there that\u2019s really cracked it yet.", "LG: If you\u2019re going to do something aside from genetic testing or beyond genetic testing, you were to take that next step and the consumerization of health care, what would that be?", "I think you can look at our business and say, I have one medical partnership and that\u2019s with the state of Nevada, with Renown, and that\u2019s it. It\u2019s a phenomenal partnership. I have partnerships with almost every retail. Walgreen\u2019s, CVS, Best Buy. We\u2019re in every place. When I think about the potential of health care and really becoming cheaper, what is that opportunity for the majority of us where we\u2019re not critically ill right now, is that you walk into a retail environment. You walk into Target. Target has a partnership with Kaiser. They have minute clinics in CVS. ", "I think that there\u2019s a potential for actually taking a lot of the existing health care stuff that we\u2019re doing outside of that system. When I\u2019ve got Kaiser, and if I have a mole that looks odd, I don\u2019t go to the doctor, I take a picture. I email. Kaiser produced statistics recently, something like 50 percent of their visits now are online, just like an email or a video chat. There\u2019s a new way to approach health care, and so that\u2019s what I\u2019m really into. When I think about Obamacare, when I used to invest and I would invest in India and Brazil, I could just walk into an Apollo and I could pay $100 and I could get an MRI, and I did that because it was like a six-week wait and $2,000 to get the MRI back at home.", "KS: I did that when I was sick in Hong Kong. ", "It\u2019s so much more accessible. That\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to pioneer, but the No. 1 thing that you need is you need collective voice.", "KS: It\u2019s interesting because there\u2019s so much anger throughout the populace about health care. Everyone\u2019s getting buffeted around these Senate bills and these House bills, none of which they seem to be able to solve for various reasons.", "I almost stepped back from it. There\u2019s a reason why we don\u2019t take insurance. I am not part of the health care system. People ask that question all the time of why don\u2019t you take reimbursement, etc. Because I don\u2019t want to be part of the existing system. I really want to do everything I can also to support, you pay for it yourself. You should step up. For some parts of health care that are just routine, you pay for it, but make it affordable, and we\u2019re really focused on making it affordable. I look around the community, what other partners are out there that are also really thinking about the consumer and affordable access to health care for consumers.", "LG: One of the things I hear a lot from consumers who are interested in doing 23andMe or another DNA testing kit is they\u2019re just concerned about the implications. They either think that they\u2019re going to get some bad news. They say, \u201cI don\u2019t want to learn how I\u2019m going to die or what disease I\u2019m going to die from,\u201d but another thing that you\u2019ve mentioned before and on your earlier podcast with Kara is it\u2019s not just a window or insight into our genome, but it can also point to patterns around things like capabilities, things like being good at sports or being good at certain subjects and that kind of thing. What are the implications for that when the world just becomes this massive database of genes and you start to be able to spot patterns like this? ", "This is a big topic in Silicon Valley right now because of I won\u2019t say who, but someone\u2019s memo that went viral about women\u2019s capabilities in an engineering space. Talk about that, once we\u2019re able to spot patterns of certain things and what the implications of that are.", "One of the most important things to put out there will be everything\u2019s going to be based on probabilities. I can look at ... My father\u2019s a particle physicist and so he\u2019s very good at math. I likely inherited some other math abilities. Doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m great. I look at myself and my two sisters, one out of the three of us is really, really good at math than the other two. It\u2019s all going to be about probabilities. If you have something in your DNA that says, okay, you are likely to be better, you might be better at math or you might be better ...", "LG: I\u2019m better at basketball than Kara. ", "Wow. I was going to say.", "KS: Everybody\u2019s better at basketball than Kara.", "I was going to say, that\u2019s a low bar, girl.", "KS: It\u2019s a low bar. ", "If you\u2019re likely better at basketball than others, there\u2019s the environmental component that\u2019s so critical to factor in here. I think it\u2019s really interesting to see what are you potentially better at in some areas? We have the one test, are you more likely to be a sprinter or a long endurance test.", "KS: Yeah, my kids were talking about that the other day.", "It\u2019s fascinating to see, but it doesn\u2019t still preclude you. You could still be one or the other with the right environmental influences. All these things are going to say, you have an additional edge on one side here, but it doesn\u2019t mean that your environment can overcome it. ", "KS: Can take advantage of it. Right.", "I think for us, part of what we\u2019re trying to understand with all of this is how much of an influence do genetics have in each area. We don\u2019t know. In some areas, it\u2019s definitely going to have more of an influence than others, like brown eyes. You have certain genes, you are very likely to have brown eyes. Not 100 percent, but much more likely. That\u2019s where environment\u2019s not going to have as much of an influence. This is what we\u2019re really trying to understand.

Peoples\u2019 genetic data goes in some kind of database. What happens when your company sells, goes public, is hacked, subpoenaed?", "LG: This is something I\u2019ve wondered about a lot because I use a lot of these consumer health apps, and I\u2019ve seen especially fitness tracking and food tracking ones over the past few years, it\u2019s been this consolidation where a lot of bigger brands are buying up smaller consumer apps, where I\u2019ve been entering in my activity data and my food data and everything for years, and all of a sudden this big brand owns that. Everyone says it\u2019s an anonymized, aggregated data, but there are ways data scientists have been able to back into these data sets. What happens in the event of 23andMe ever getting acquired by a larger entity?", "A few things. We\u2019ve always run the company that privacy and your ownership and control of your genome is the most important, it\u2019s the foundation of this company. It\u2019s one of the things I think about in a lot of research studies. If you were going to participate in a research study at let\u2019s say UCSF, once you participate you can\u2019t necessarily pull your data out. We give people control all the time. At any point in time, you call 23andMe or you email in and say, \u201cI want to delete my data,\u201d we\u2019ll delete all your data. We can\u2019t undo a research project or something we\u2019ve done, but you can delete your data at any time.", "The control is with you. You can share your genome if you want and you can not share your genome if you want. We also have set up the database in such a way that your genetic information is totally separate from any of your identifiable, your personal information. If there was a merger, if there was something that came out there, one of the key elements for us is that consumers always have that ability to just delete their data.", "KS: What about hacking or subpoenas?", "Subpoenas we have resisted every request that has come, and we\u2019ve never handed over data.", "KS: And hacking?", "It\u2019s what we\u2019ve said, we\u2019ve done everything we can. Knock on wood, again, never been hacked. Without a doubt, there will be interest in it. At the same time, I do push on it sometimes. Your bank account is inherently interesting or your passwords are inherently interesting. If I come and I get your DNA, I\u2019m like, \u201cHuh, Kara\u2019s not great at basketball and she\u2019s got brown eyes and she\u2019s European.\u201d There\u2019s the interest element.

Why am I in cold Boston when I can be at Stanford just loving life?\u201d I made a commitment to myself that I was gonna come out here, and that\u2019s what happened.

We\u2019re arguably at a new peak right now. I would argue that back then, there were probably more women in senior ranks in venture firms than there are today. It so happened that the folks that were ushered out of the business, within a couple of years after the bubble bursting, were folks that focused in a couple of areas. Consumer, which were largely the female partners, and telecommunications equipment, optical networking-type folks. All of them are gone. And that was probably the first wave of women exiting the business. ", "Ha. Interesting. ", "I think. And it\u2019s slowly built up more and more over time, but we\u2019re clearly in a position right now in the venture universe where there is a dearth of women at the senior ranks. ", "Absolutely. All those statistics are declining, people at MIT, everywhere. It\u2019s gone from 20s to 15s, the numbers, at Harvard business school, everything, everywhere that these people would come out of.

I said I wanted to be in tech, and I landed this job with Qwest Communications, which, at that time, was an upstart telecommunications company. ", "Yeah, I remember. ", "I knew, probably, how to answer a phone, that was about as much as I knew about telecommunications. But I learned really fast.

It was an incredibly controversial company, it grew tremendously, and they gave a 28-year-old woman, who knew nothing about telecommunications, a real shot to do something. I headed up business development for them, and in a couple of years, we grew from 1,000 to 15,000 people, and my role was to interface with the startups in Silicon Valley.

It was, and I certainly did very well there. I headed up business development there, and again, for a 28-year-old woman, I was one of four female VPs in the company. ", "Which is a lot, actually. ", "But for a company of that size ...", "Right, it was a lot.", "... it was not a lot. And I was incredibly lucky, fortunate, whatever you want to call it, to be given that amount of responsibility at such a young age, with such little knowledge of the industry. But, again, my main role was interfacing with venture-backed startups, so the transition to venture was fairly easy thereafter. And then, again, I found myself at Canaan Partners in March of 2000, being really excited about the industry and excited about the job, but knowing very, very little. ", "And why did you ... why venture? What was the ... I\u2019m always interested in how people decide to do something. \u2019Cause you could have gone on to work at any one, any company, all of them were into that idea of bandwidth and things like that. ", "I found myself very intellectually curious about how these companies that I was seeing and interfacing with on a daily basis were started. From many standpoints, I was looking at how exciting it was to build a company. I was seeing in internally at Qwest, but I was also looking at these founders that I was working with in my business development role, and looking at their psychological makeup. What made these people take so much of a financial, personal, professional risk in starting this company that could easily die within a couple of years from now? And there was something really thrilling about that. There was something really thrilling about seeing somebody\u2019s core nugget of an idea, and watching that blossom over time. And frankly, that\u2019s what drew me. ", "And you didn\u2019t want to do that yourself. ", "I didn\u2019t want to do it myself. Because I didn\u2019t have that risk-loving appetite, to use somewhat of an economic term, I wasn\u2019t risk-loving enough to put, to use a poker term, to be all-in on one idea. ", "Right. It\u2019s interesting because it\u2019s other people\u2019s money, so what\u2019s the difference? Fair enough, and I didn\u2019t care because it\u2019s other people\u2019s money kinda thing. You started to do that, and you focused in ... what were your initial investments? What did you look at? ", "I was, because I was coming from Qwest, my main ... for probably 10 years thereafter, my main focus had come in was \u2014 and has been and is \u2014 infrastructure software. I tend to focus on data center stuff. Mainly software, some hardware, but everything that makes the back-end systems work. Storage, security, business intelligence, all the virtualization, everything that\u2019s boring. That\u2019s where I focused on. And then along the way ...", "Jaded Cisco venture cap, things that sell the Cisco. ", "Exactly. They move \u2014 sell \u2014 the Cisco. That\u2019s right. ", "That\u2019s over. ", "It\u2019s not over though. They are a huge acquirer, and will continue to be. ", "But along the way, decided that, \u201cGosh, I actually like this consumer stuff, too,\u201d and made a couple of bets there, and I\u2019ve been very fortunate to have some successes there. ", "Right. Tell me, which ones.", "We are Series A investors, largely, at Canaan Partners, so the strategy at the firm is to invest at that Series A, where there may have been seed money put in the company, there might not have been. And when we do that Series A, we\u2019ve raised somewhat large funds. The most recent fund that we\u2019ve raised is $800 million. From a financial perspective, in order to return multiples on that $800 million, ownership is everything. We need to be partners with the CEO and we need to probably take 80-100 percent of that Series A round. We tend not to syndicate at the early stages, and then we\u2019ll syndicate thereafter. Some of the companies that we\u2019ve invested in, that I\u2019ve invested in, have been Kabam, on the consumer side, which recently sold, last year sold, which is a mobile gaming company, and we seeded and led the Series A there.

Those are different in gaming, this, and what else? ", "It\u2019s a lot different from storage virtualization software. ", "Yeah. I would imagine. ", "It is. And frankly, I stayed away from a lot of the consumer stuff for a while because I didn\u2019t want to be the woman who is doing consumer stuff. I knew that once I opened the door, I would get a floodgate of it, or I would open the floodgates, and that has happened, but in a much more positive way than I initially thought it would. ", "All right, let\u2019s talk a little bit of it, here you are, doing this, I met with a lot of venture capitalists yesterday, of all things, I\u2019ve got a lot of what\u2019s going on in my mind, I was trying to get a sense of where the market is right now. And pretty much every person felt like it was just too flooded right now, there\u2019s too much money tracking very bad ideas now that it\u2019s really ... there\u2019s been a ... not a lack of innovation, a lack of ideas, a lack of where anything\u2019s going, and so I think everyone communicated that there\u2019s $200 million funds, there\u2019s too many. And one person, which I thought was funny, said to me, when someone asked what he did, \u201cI sell money.\u201d ", "Wow. ", "Which I thought was great, actually. It\u2019s exactly what a ven ... \u201cI\u2019m selling money to entrepreneurs.\u201d I thought that was a brilliant way to describe, honest way, to describe it.", "It\u2019s honest.

And then the last thing we\u2019ll talk about, we\u2019ll talk about what\u2019s hot. But what do you think the state is right now? ", "When I joined the industry in 2000, there were years of ... it was the nuclear dead zone, right? It was just years of slogging and slogging and slogging through a really poor exit environment. And I\u2019d say that lasted up until 2005 or 2006. To give context, we would look around and we\u2019d say, \u201cGod, that\u2019s a company that exited for $200 million? Woohoo! That\u2019s wonderful.\u201d That mindset or that changed because of the current environment is remarkable. And we\u2019re now looking at the last nine years of up and to the right. And we\u2019re also looking at a cast of characters in the venture industry that have, a lot of them have only seen up and to the right. And so they do look at their jobs as selling money. That\u2019s not our job. ", "Our job is to return capital to our limited partners, hopefully, in multiples. And we do that by investing in ideas that we think will become huge and then, hopefully, advising the companies along the way. But what is the most concerning right now, and what we pushed on a lot at Canaan, is kind of the opposite of that. What is most concerning right now is the flood of capital coming in, and I totally understand why, right? ", "There\u2019s nowhere to go. ", "Investors, pension funds, etc., they\u2019re seeking alpha. They have nowhere to go. The market, the public market is at an all-time high, and they want to at least put some of their capital into risk capital. We are a beneficiary and, one may say looking back on this, a victim of that. Although I can\u2019t say that venture capitalists are victims, but we are a willing recipient of that. ", "We have got to maintain, at Canaan, I can\u2019t control the industry. We\u2019ve got to maintain discipline, we\u2019ve got to be intentional about how we invest, and for us, we\u2019ve reacted to the current environment by being very focused on franchise areas. There\u2019s areas that we will focus on, and we\u2019ll go deep and get to know all the executives, entrepreneurs and develop thesis around those areas so that if we\u2019re seeing a white space, we either will incubate a company, of we\u2019ll find three or four entrepreneurs, bring them together, and seed them with that idea.", "Right. That\u2019s super thoughtful.", "And that\u2019s how we do it.", "But you don\u2019t operate in a vacuum.", "We don\u2019t.", "And there\u2019s all this money flying around. It doesn\u2019t matter ... that\u2019s the worry is that there\u2019s all this money flying around and the entrepreneurs have a lot of choices. Even the worse ones. ", "Right. That is our reaction to it. Our reaction is to be much more deliberate and intentional so that we can go after those ideas before those entrepreneurs actually are shopping their deals. But there ... you\u2019re absolutely right, we\u2019re in an environment that is high-valuation, highly competitive, etc. When I entered the business 17 years ago, you could survive as a generalist. I could easily invest in a consumer company over here and network equipment company over there and no one would think anything of it. Today\u2019s world is much different. As a VC, you\u2019ve got to be a subject matter expert, you\u2019ve gotta go deep in areas because that\u2019s the only way of differentiating yourself.", "And that means what? Given, again, there\u2019s so much money and people don\u2019t ... they\u2019re a little bit loose, I don\u2019t know how else to put it. ", "Without question, yeah. It\u2019s troubling. ", "Do you think that we\u2019re in a non-innovative period or a shift of \u2014 and we\u2019ll talk about that next \u2014 where do you think we are on innovation, \u2019cause it feels like we\u2019re still at the tail end of the old way of doing venture capital and I want to talk about what the new way would be of doing it because it hasn\u2019t ... I guess Andreessen Horowitz was the last venture firm created in the old style, even though they were talking about being different, they\u2019re sort of the same. What do you imagine happening? And then we\u2019ll talk about it next. ", "I\u2019ll talk about what we invest in and then we\u2019ll talk about how that trickles down or trickles up to the venture community. We are in a non-innovative ... we\u2019re in a massive transitionary period in one segment of our investments, which is a negative, and then on the consumer side, we\u2019ll talk about that in a second. On the enterprise side, we have been open sourced to death. Almost every part of the stack up to the app layer is getting open sourced. Which is phenomenal for the developer, it\u2019s phenomenal for cost structure of enterprises \u2014 it\u2019s a very difficult environment, though, in which to be an enterprise investor.

To boot, you have companies like Cisco, HP, Symantec, EMC, etc., which, for the exception of Cisco, have had their own troubles and have not been acquisitive. It is a difficult landscape, and there are, again, pockets that we\u2019re finding, but I\u2019m relatively bearish there. The consumer side of the house, it is ... we\u2019ve not seen ... several years ago, we saw ...", "A bunch of innovations.", "We saw mobile come into the scene, right? ", "Not just that but Airbnb, Uber, Pinterest, there\u2019s a whole bunch.", "Which happened because of mobile, right? Mobile was that core shift in the market that caused all of these massive companies to grow and to own it, to own new spaces. Like Uber and Airbnb, which I would argue at this point, the two of those companies should be looked at as public goods in addition to fabulous companies. But what we\u2019re waiting to see on the consumer investment side is what that next transitionary phase is going to be. What that massive new wave is going to be, and it\u2019s not there yet, but that doesn\u2019t mean that in a year or two from now we won\u2019t see it.

And yeah, it is a concern. It\u2019s caused us internally to look at, to question how we\u2019re doing business. As I said, we\u2019ve been fortunate to have incredible velocity of exits in my firm over the last three years, which has caused us to be able to raise this most recent fund, with so quickly and have the support of incredible limited partners.

Whether it\u2019s adding new features, making existing functions work better, or even just fixing the inevitable bugs or other glitches that often occur in today\u2019s advanced digital devices, the idea of upgrades is generally very appealing.", "With some tech-based products, you can add new hardware \u2014 such as plugging a new graphics card into a desktop PC \u2014 to update a device. Most upgrades, however, are software-based. Given the software-centric nature of everything from modern cars to smart speakers to, of course, smartphones and other common computing devices, this is by far the most common type of enhancement that our digital gadgets receive.", "The range of software upgrades made for devices varies tremendously \u2014 from very subtle tweaks that are essentially invisible to most users, through dramatic feature enhancements that enable capabilities that weren\u2019t there before the upgrade. In most cases, however, you don\u2019t see entire new hardware functions being made available through software upgrades. I\u2019m starting to wonder, however, if that concept is going to change.", "The event that triggered my thought process was Tesla\u2019s recent decision to ", "remotely and temporarily enhance the battery capacity, and therefore driving range, of its Tesla vehicles", " for owners in Florida who were trying to escape the impact of the recent Hurricane Irma. Tesla has offered software-based hardware upgrades \u2014 not only to increase driving range but to turn on its autonomous driving features \u2014 for several years.", "Nevertheless, it\u2019s not widely known that several differently priced models of Tesla\u2019s cars are identical from a hardware perspective, but differ only in the software loaded into the car. Want the S75 or the S60? There\u2019s an $8,500 price and 41-mile range difference between the two, but the only actual change is nothing more than a software enablement of batteries that exist in both models. Similarly, the company\u2019s AutoPilot feature is $2,500 on a new car, but can be enabled via an over-the-air software update on most other Tesla cars for $3,000 after the purchase.", "In the case of the Florida customers, Tesla was clearly trying to do a good thing (though I\u2019m sure many were frustrated that the feature was remotely taken away almost as quickly as it had been remotely enabled), but the practice of software-based hardware upgrades certainly raises some questions. On the one hand, it\u2019s arguably nice to have the ability to \u201cadd\u201d these hardware features after the fact (even with the post-purchase $500 fee above what it would have cost \u201cbuilt-in\u201d to a new car), but there is something that doesn\u2019t seem right about intentionally disabling capabilities that are already there.", "Clearly, Tesla\u2019s policies haven\u2019t exactly held back enthusiasm for many of their cars, but I do wonder if we\u2019re going to start seeing other companies take a similar approach on less-expensive devices as a new way to drive profits.", "In the semiconductor industry, the process of \u201cbinning\u201d \u2014 in which chips of the same design are separated into different \u201cbins\u201d based on their performance and thermal characteristics, and then marketed as having different minimum performance requirements \u2014 has been going on for decades. In the case of chips, however, there isn\u2019t a way to upgrade them \u2014 except perhaps with overclocking, where you try to run a chip faster than what its minimum stated frequency is \u2014 and there\u2019s no guarantee that it will work. The nature of the semiconductor manufacturing process simply creates these different thermal and frequency ranges, and vendors have intelligently figured out a way to create different models based on the variations that occur.", "In other product categories, however, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we start to see more of these software-based hardware upgrades. The benefits of building one hardware platform and then differentiating solely based on software can make economic sense for products that are made in very large quantities. The ability to source identical parts and develop manufacturing processes around a single design can translate into savings for some vendors, even if the component costs are a bit higher than they might otherwise be with a variety of different configurations or designs.", "The truth is that it is notoriously challenging for tech hardware businesses to make much money. With few exceptions, the profit-margin percentages for tech hardware are in the low single digits, and many companies actually lose money on hardware sales. Most hope to make it up via accessories or other services. As a result, there\u2019s more willingness to experiment with business models, particularly as we see the lifespans for different generations of products continue to shrink.", "Ironically, though, after years of charging for software upgrades, we\u2019ve seen most companies start to offer their software upgrades for free. As a result, I think there\u2019s more reticence for consumers and other end users to pay for traditional software-only upgrades. In the case of these software-enabled hardware upgrades, however, we could start to see the pendulum swing back the other way, as virtually all of these upgrades have a price associated with them. In the case of Tesla cars, in fact, it\u2019s a very large cost. Some have argued that this is because Tesla sees itself as more of a software company than a hardware one, but I think that\u2019s a difficult concept for many to accept. Plus, for many traditional hardware companies who may want to try this model, the positioning could be even more difficult.", "Despite these concerns, I have a feeling that the software-based hardware upgrade is an approach we\u2019re going to see a number of companies try variations on for several years to come. There\u2019s no question that it will continue to come with a reasonable share of controversies (and risks \u2014 if the software upgrades become publicly available via frustrated hackers), but I think it\u2019s something we\u2019re going to have to get used to \u2014 like it or not.", "Bob O\u2019Donnell", " is the founder and chief analyst of ", "Technalysis Research LLC", ", a technology consulting and market research firm that provides strategic consulting and market research services to the technology industry and professional financial community.

", "The board unanimously voted to accept that the probable cause of the crash included a combination of factors. The first was the failure of the driver of the truck that the Tesla collided with to yield to the car, and second was the driver\u2019s inattentiveness due to his overreliance on Autopilot. ", "The proposal for probable cause reads in part: ", "\u201cContributing to the car driver\u2019s overreliance on the vehicle automation was its operational design, which permitted his prolonged disengagement from the driving task and his use of the automation in ways inconsistent with guidance and warnings from the manufacturer.\u201d", "This was the first known fatal crash that involved a car that was using automated driving control systems. ", "The NTSB also voted to approve a series of seven safety recommendations that were directed at the U.S. Department of Transportation, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and other car makers with Autopilot-like features. At the core of those recommendations was an emphasis on ensuring these features can only be used within their set limitations. (Full list of recommendations are below.) ", "According to the NTSB, Tesla\u2019s Autopilot operated within its limitations but was being used in ways and situations that it was not designed for. Moreover, the driver only engaged with the steering wheel seven times for 25 seconds over the course of 40 minutes before the crash. ", "\u201cThe pattern of the use of Autopilot, including the lack of steering wheel interaction and lack of response prior to the crash shows over-reliance on the automation,\u201d NTSB member Dr. Ensar Becic said during the meeting. \u201cThe driver\u2019s engagement during operation of a level 2 system is critical for safety.\u201d ", "For that reason, Tesla\u2019s system will continuously issue visual and then auditory warnings to ensure drivers are paying attention. There will be three warnings before the car slows down to a stop with its flashers on. However, the driver engaged with the steering wheel each time the car issued an initial warning. ", "But Dr. Becic said that simply putting your hands on the steering wheel is a \u201cpoor surrogate\u201d for determining driver attention. ", "In fact, the last interaction the driver had with the car before the crash was one minute and 51 seconds before his Model S collided with the truck. The driver set his cruising speed at 74 mph, even though the maximum speed is automatically set to five miles over the speed limit. Again, while there are set limitations on speed for Autopilot, the user can still raise it beyond the limit. ", "The system\u2019s cameras and radars also did not detect the semi-truck that was crossing the driver\u2019s path before the fatal collision. However, the system was not designed to detect crossing traffic and is only intended for use on freeways or highways where there is limited access to crossing or entering cars. ", "Still, Autopilot continued to operate on that road with cross-traffic.", "\u201cThe system really relies, even if the instructions are very clear, it relies on the driver to adhere to the design limitations of Autopilot,\u201d Dr. Becic said during the meeting. \u201cAs I mentioned earlier, it would be much easier for a system to automatically establish that.\u201d  ", "\"At Tesla, the safety of our customers comes first, and one thing is very clear: Autopilot significantly increases safety, as NHTSA has found that it reduces accident rates by 40%,\u201d a Tesla spokesperson said. \u201cWe appreciate the NTSB\u2019s analysis of last year\u2019s tragic accident and we will evaluate their recommendations as we continue to evolve our technology. We will also continue to be extremely clear with current and potential customers that Autopilot is not a fully self-driving technology and drivers need to remain attentive at all times.\u201d", "The problem the board continued to hit on was though the Autopilot system operated within its limits, it was being used outside of how it was designed to be used. This, Dr. Becic argued, is something that can be remedied by developing the software so that it doesn\u2019t work outside of its design limits.

Both you and the American intelligence community say well, this is actually in the middle of Russia\u2019s overt war against the U.S. conducted, it\u2019s an information war. The stuff that starts on the cable channel ends up on Facebook in various forms. Is that a fair way of putting it?", "It is. Though to be fair, RT, they have a mix of programming that you would look at it and say okay, there\u2019s Larry King who has a show on RT. There\u2019s Ed Shultz, a former MSNBC anchor who has a show on RT. He\u2019s changed since he was on MSNBC. He no longer rails against Vladimir Putin. ", "There\u2019s some randomness in the mix. They used to have Julian Assange had a show there. As you point out, it\u2019s not always pro-Russian, it\u2019s not always pro-Trump. There\u2019s a lot of lefty stuff there. It seems like the true line is, let\u2019s put out news that undercuts the idea of mainstream America, and establishment America. ", "Yes. Over the years, it\u2019s also found a place where it has found an audience here is in the realms of on the left maybe with the Occupy movement, but on the right, is it home, where\u2019s Alex Jones sometimes? He\u2019s frequently been on their air, and early on especially they say they\u2019re cutting it out on this level, but they would do 9/11 truthers. Give them some airtime. It\u2019s often about playing off the fringes, and it finds its place in the sort of outer poles of our political debate. ", "As you said, it was mentioned in the American intelligence findings at the beginning of the year. It\u2019s carried on traditional cable carriers. Comcast, etc. I\u2019m not sure if Comcast, but the big carriers carry it. Are they getting any blowback for ... now people realized what this thing is?", "They are getting some blowback, but I want to chat on a very good story the Journal did about their carriage. Within the last couple of months, what the Journal found \u2014 which was fascinating \u2014 was that in some cases they have gotten themselves onto free over-the-air broadcast channels, it\u2019s sort of leased space with broadcast channels in various markets. Meaning that the Comcasts of the world must carry them under the must-carry rules.", "They\u2019ve exploited some of the rules that government broadcasting and cable carriage in the U.S., which ... and that\u2019s true onto the piece you wrote about Facebook as well. ", "Just curious about the reporting of this story. You spent time in Russia, I was asking you off-air if you\u2019ve got any background there, you don\u2019t. ", "When you parachute into a country like this, and specifically Russia, what do you do to prepare yourself? It\u2019s not necessarily a welcome environment for a Western journalist, certainly not for journalists broadly. What did you do to prepare?", "Well, first, getting the visa was hard, and we want to follow all the rules. We have a bureau there that I don\u2019t want to interfere with them. I don\u2019t want to be careless, reckless, so getting the visa was hair-raising. ", "You don\u2019t want to create problems with the Times journalist in Russia. ", "Not from my colleagues. If I play around with the visa, it could hurt them with their visas. The Russian visa offices in New York made me wait \u2014 literally, I didn\u2019t get the Visa completed till the day before my flight. ", "Then there\u2019s the issue of a fixer. You need someone on the ground who can help you because I still can\u2019t say hello in Russian. You need someone on the ground. ", "I was going to say \u201cpajowsta.\u201d I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s correct. I don\u2019t think it is.", "It\u2019s \u201cstratzvidyeh.\u201d ", "I took first semester Russian twice. ", "Wow. ", "You don\u2019t speak Russian. Neither do I, we\u2019ve established, so you need someone to guide you through there. What do you do to protect yourself either physically or in terms of protecting your iPhone or whatever other equipment you\u2019ve got?", "Physically there was no issue whatsoever. I took a travel phone with me and a travel laptop. The truth is, the week I was there, Rex Tillerson was there. His first visit to Moscow as a Secretary of State. If there\u2019s any surveillance happening, I\u2019m sure it was taken up by the American delegation. I had a sense of security in that regard.", "Everyone you talked to in the piece \u2014 you\u2019ve got copious quotes on the record \u2014 they seem very happy to have you writing about them. It seems like getting access to write about RT and Sputnik, which is their sub-brand. They\u2019re excited to have you do it or at least happy to have you do it. ", "I would say, especially Dmitry Peskov. Vladimir Putin\u2019s spokesman was clearly excited to talk about the subject in a meta way, or do I say macro way. His office assistant said no one\u2019s really asked him to wax on about his media theory. He was not a Western journalist and he was really smart about it. Clearly they\u2019re smart about it. ", "His argument was to me, fascinating in parts that got a little less pickup, was this idea that every ... the economy has moved on from being commodity-based so much. It\u2019s often perception-based, and that changes, everybody\u2019s interest realigned. Information is everything and so there\u2019s an information war, and that information war is about a new jockeying for power and position. ", "And he maintains, Russia is only responding to western media meddling in its backyard forever. It\u2019s only responding to other threats, but my favorite thing he said was look at someone like Kim Kardashian and talking about how easy it is to manipulate opinion, all of her Twitter followers, man, if she ever were political, imagine the power she would have with no intelligence service, no military. Just the way they were thinking about it, and hearing that was to me just fascinating. ", "Right. They\u2019re again out front saying, yeah, we\u2019re in there. We\u2019re trying to manipulate the media for gain \u2014 in this case, political gain. The same thing as Kim Kardashian promoting her butt. That\u2019s the weekend story from the magazine and then on Monday in the Times, on your mediator column, you\u2019ve got this piece going after Facebook, specifically for not being as upfront as you think they should be about Russia\u2019s involvement. Again the thrill on there. ", "Your argument is they either can or should know more about what\u2019s going on in terms of what happened on Facebook, in terms of Russian folks buying ads, spreading this information, and they should share that information with us. Do you think that\u2019s going to happen?", "I actually think it is going to have to happen. There\u2019d been reports from over the weekend that Bob Mueller, the special counsel has gotten their data about this campaign, this alleged Russian campaign, and there\u2019s just mixed reports, that this required a search warrant. No matter what \u2014 I\u2019ve covered politics most of my career, especially political advertising \u2014 and when there\u2019s a shady ad that there were questions about how it was financed and it didn\u2019t seem fair, our system was able to look at it, try to figure out who the funding source was, understand what it had said, where it was wrong. That\u2019s how our system works. ", "There\u2019s rules about it, and by the way, this may happen after the fact, and maybe by the time you get around to figuring out who financed that ad it\u2019s after the election, but you can usually figure it out, harder now I think with Citizens United. But eventually you can do it. ", "Yeah. By the way, television stations have to keep records that anyone in the public can see. Literally anyone can see within certain windows close to elections who bought what ads, maybe who bought it as like Citizens for Blue Skies and you have to figure out who they really are, but there\u2019s a record of this, and there\u2019s talk now on Capitol Hill about making social media properly account for this kind of advertising as well. ", "Facebook, it seems like one of the arguments they\u2019re making is look, legally we can\u2019t give you more information than we\u2019ve given you already, which is very vague. If Mueller compels a subpoena, we can give him more, but we\u2019re limited in what we can actually provide. Do you think that can get changed with the law? Do you think they can just get out ahead of it and just say, \u201cIn this case, we\u2019re going to tell you all about it, but it\u2019s a one-time-only thing.\u201d ", "Not everyone is convinced that their legal argument in this case \u2014 as is often the case with law \u2014 is a slam dunk. There\u2019s probably more they can share, and it always ... There seems with Facebook on this issues that whatever the legal constraint also happens to fit nicely with their public relations imperative here. Is it really in their interest to show potentially really nasty divisive ads or Facebook post that were completely false? It\u2019s not great branding for them. They\u2019ve been fighting with this. Defending the idea that they were a receptacle for fake news for months now. I don\u2019t know. Something tells me ...", "Zuckerberg said, I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re talking to us, we had nothing to do with it, and eventually over time, all right, there\u2019s a little bit more. Like you said you covered politics for a long time, you cover media as well. There\u2019s this meme bouncing around that says you know what, it\u2019s finally Silicon Valley\u2019s time in the barrel, some combination of Amazon and Twitter and YouTube and Facebook is finally drawing scrutiny from the politicians. They\u2019ve been unregulated up until now but now things are going to change. Are you one of those folks who believes that?", "I think so. The one thing is in this political era. Conventional wisdom is continually turned upside down but it definitely seems like, there\u2019s definitely a political will, a pretty wide political will to make sure there\u2019s more transparency in terms of political activity, and then it goes on up the chain in terms of a lot of Silicon Valley companies and issues about regulation and alleged monopoly or duopoly power. The trajectory seems pretty set again, like, who knows?", "Yeah. I\u2019m a little confused by it, because it seems like look, the Republicans are against regulation, and during the Obama era, Washington really didn\u2019t touch Silicon Valley at all. Google never got touched. Facebook, no one even went there. It\u2019s a little difficult for me to figure out how this is something that someone wants to spend a political capital on, but I keep hearing from smart people including you that says no, it\u2019s going to happen, so I guess we\u2019ll see. ", "There\u2019s something interesting going on in the Trump movement though, especially when it comes to Silicon Valley, there\u2019s some hostility. Trump himself has hinted for instance at Amazon, does it need more regulation? Politics doesn\u2019t line up anymore the way we used to think they did on issues. ", "He campaigned about everyone, and he didn\u2019t campaign against Silicon Valley. He campaigned against Mexico and China, who are good fat political targets to go after. ", "He did, but some of his supporters did. They said Google is skewing the election results for Hillary Clinton. Facebook is hiding conservative views. The counter to some of the liberal complaints. There is a part of the Trump movement that is very anti-Silicon Valley. Very anti-Silicon Valley. ", "I knew this is going to happen. We were going to talk for 15 minutes, and I was going to regret not having you in for a full 45 minutes or an hour, so here\u2019s what we\u2019ll do. We\u2019ll bring you in later this year. You\u2019ll come sit down. We\u2019ll sit face to face and have a real conversation in person. Sound good?", "That\u2019s awesome. I think my voice will sound much better in studio. ", "You sound great right now, and you will sound better in person, so Jim Rutenberg, thank you for your time. We could find you with the New York Times, on Twitter, are you on Facebook?", "Yeah. I\u2019m on all of the above, @JimRutenberg on Twitter, and Jim Rutenberg on Facebook. ", "We have a very savvy audience. They\u2019ll be able to figure out how to find you.

If not, well ... there is a large and growing bin of technological castoffs.", "Part of the reason that the wearable market hasn\u2019t lived up to its early expectations is directly related to this existential crisis.

Clearly, that has not happened, though some seem to hold out hope that the possibility still exists.", "Those hopes were particularly strong over the last few days, with rumors about both a potential ", "LTE modem-equipped version of the Apple Watch", " coming this fall and a potential deal between Apple and Cigna to provide Apple Watches to their health-insurance customers. Some have even argued that an LTE-equipped Apple Watch is a game-changer that can bring dramatic new life to the smartwatch and overall wearable industry.", "The argument, essentially, is that by finally freeing a smartwatch from the tyranny of its smartphone connection, the smartwatch can finally evolve into the general-purpose tool it was always intended to be. Applications that depend on a network connection can run on their own, duplicative efforts on the watch and the phone can be eliminated, and who knows, maybe we can finally get the Dick Tracy videophone watch we\u2019ve always dreamt of.", "Color me skeptical. Sure, it would be nice to be able to, say, use Spotify or other streaming apps to get dynamic playlists as you exercise, or get texts and other phone-related notifications while you\u2019re away from your phone. Industry-changing and market moving, however, it is not \u2014 especially when you factor in the additional costs for both the modem and the service plan you\u2019re going to have to sign up for, as well.", "Plus, let\u2019s not forget that several vendors (notably Samsung and LG) have already released modem-equipped smartwatches, and they haven\u2019t exactly stormed up the device-sales charts. This is due, in part, to the same basic physics challenge that Apple will also have to face: Add a modem to a device, and it will reduce battery life. Given that many people are frustrated with the battery life on their existing smartwatches, having to dramatically (or even minimally) increase the size of the device in order to accommodate a larger battery, seems like a strong challenge \u2014 even for the device wizards at Apple.", "The potential of crafting a more health-care-friendly smartwatch, on the other hand, seems much more appealing to me, and the alleged tie-up with Cigna could be a very interesting move. Apple was said to have some very sophisticated sensors in the works when the Apple Watch was first announced \u2014 such as a noninvasive blood glucose monitoring component, and a pulse oximeter \u2014 and with every new release, there\u2019s increased expectations for those components to finally arrive. If (or when) they do, the health-care benefits could prove to be significant for people who choose to use the device. Of course, the need to report all that data back to your insurance company on a regular basis \u2014 as a connection with a health-care company certainly implies \u2014 will undoubtedly raise a number of privacy and security-related concerns, as well.", "Even if those new sensors do appear on the next-generation Apple Watch, however, they will further cement the growing sentiment that wearables are actually specialty-purpose devices that are really optimized for a few specific tasks. Not that that\u2019s a bad thing \u2014 it\u2019s just a different reality than many people envisioned.", "In the end, though, dispelling the myth that wearables can or should be general-purpose devices could, ironically, be the very thing that helps them finally reach the wider audience that many originally thought they could.", "Bob O\u2019Donnell", " is the founder and chief analyst of ", "Technalysis Research LLC", ", a technology consulting and market research firm that provides strategic consulting and market research services to the technology industry and professional financial community.

Let\u2019s go work on an urban innovation.\u201d And so I started to get really interested in this notion of just kind of mixing tech and other sectors.", "As I was doing that, I had the maybe less fortunate experience, which is a close family member of mine, my brother, had a heart attack a few years ago. I\u2019m young, I\u2019m decently healthy, I haven\u2019t really paid attention to health care that much, frankly, like a lot of folks. But then I saw what he went through. You always hear heath care is broken, this, that, and the other. But it\u2019s a super foreign concept until you experience it yourself. ", "KS: Enter the system.", "Yeah, and then it becomes super visceral, as you know. I just watched what he went through, and I saw a bunch of different problems. I saw first, just the experience is so rough, and we take it for granted. We\u2019re like \u201cYeah, but it\u2019s health care. Why does the experience need to be good?\u201d But actually, what you find is that people don\u2019t go to the doctor, they don\u2019t engage their health. A lot of us have access to great care, but we don\u2019t even use it.", "KS: This a guy who had good care compared to most people who just ...", "Some of the best.", "KS: So the person who has good care had bad care.", "Exactly. Because that experience causes us not to go. The second thing \u2014 it really only makes sense when you experience it yourself \u2014 is that health care is reactive, not preventative. Everybody was by his side after he had the heart attack, but where were they before? It\u2019s so simple, because you can take these, I don\u2019t know, $100,000 of bills and all this pain and you can solve it for really, really simple treatments. It turns out a lot of the time the technology is there. ", "Then the third thing, and this I actually put on us as technologists, this is where we really screwed up. We haven\u2019t set up doctors for success. In this day and age, you wouldn\u2019t go up to a software engineer and say, \u201cHey, build me a website,\u201d and not hand her a laptop, but it\u2019s totally okay to go up to a doctor and say, \u201cSave my life,\u201d and then you hand them a stethoscope. It just seems absurd, this is my life we\u2019re talking about. ", "Then the last thing I saw is what I think of as health care equality. There\u2019s seven billion people on the planet, less than two billion of them have access to any form of real care. And so, how odd is it in this day and age that we can take the entirety of the world\u2019s information via Google and a smartphone and get it to the middle of India for just a few dollars, but we can\u2019t get basic health care there. It just seems odd. Obviously, it\u2019s because health care is a labor-based business, and labor doesn\u2019t scale anywhere near the same way that technology scales. One of the things that we think is a real opportunity is to take all these super routine, really inefficient things and move them from labor to technology.", "KS: I don\u2019t mean to carp on Silicon Valley people, but they always think they are going to fix everything. I mean, I think President Obama said, \u201cNot everything is fixable by a tech solution.\u201d Obviously health care has gotten sucked into this political mess, in this country, not everywhere in the world, but in this country for sure. You\u2019re sort of taking on the idea that just if you only apply a few apps and taps to it, it will be fine. Think about it, because it is labor intensive, people\u2019s bodies are analog and they\u2019re made of not the things you make digital out of.", "Yeah. I agree with you. I don\u2019t think tech\u2019s the solution. I think it\u2019s necessary, but not sufficient. The same way in Sidewalk, we didn\u2019t just say, \u201cHey, we\u2019re a bunch of tech people, let\u2019s go figure out cities.\u201d", "LG: Saving the city, yeah.", "Yeah, what we said is, \u201cHey, let\u2019s partner with people that are in that industry, that bring a lot of expertise.\u201d We\u2019ve been fortunate from the very beginning to have a lot of great doctors, nurses, medical assistants, tons of people from the world of health care. And from all the great institutions \u2014 you know, the Stanfords, UCSF, Kaiser, etc., so people that have actually done it, as opposed to people in the tech world that have just talked about it.", "KS: And they all gripe, too. My brother\u2019s a doctor.", "They do.", "KS: All he does is gripe about the system.", "And that\u2019s actually the opportunity, because they want to solve the problem, people from tech want to solve the problem, customers, they want to solve the problem. It turns out everybody is unhappy with the system. At Forward, we just said, \u201cWell, okay, why don\u2019t we just get everybody together and work on it together.\u201d", "KS: To try on one solution.", "LG: And so your solution is ... It\u2019s an analog one, ultimately, because what you\u2019re doing is you\u2019re creating a physical space, it\u2019s a clinic, where people go to. So you could have been solving EMRs, you could have been ... I know that your clinics have lots of high-tech gadgets and diagnostic tools and stuff like that, but ultimately, it\u2019s a place where people go. Talk about that and talk about the pricing of it, too.", "You brought up a great thing. It\u2019s like, \u201cYou could have solved the EMR. You could have solved the gadget. You could have solved this one thing or that one thing.\u201d But whenever you do that, you end up in this world where you\u2019re kind of still playing inside that legacy system. It\u2019s really, really hard to screw around with the legacy system. I\u2019m sure a lot of people are good at that. ", "KS: Such as using an old computer system, like mainframes, just get rid of them completely.", "Exactly, Exactly. Well, we just said, \u201cHey, let\u2019s come out with a new product.\u201d And it\u2019s not digital, it\u2019s not analog, it\u2019s all of the above. There\u2019s humans, there\u2019s technology, and they\u2019re all working in concert. That\u2019s really, really important. You see that in every modern great service. You wouldn\u2019t look at Uber and say, \u201cUber is just a tech company.\u201d Turns out it\u2019s tech, it\u2019s ops, it\u2019s people, it\u2019s cars, it\u2019s everything all packaged together and that\u2019s what makes it work.

Peace out. See yeah.\u201d And then you never hear back, you never know ... It\u2019s super fragmented, non-integrated care. We didn\u2019t like that. ", "We do work with the existing system.

Where it\u2019s easy to say, \u201cWow, $149 a month is a lot.\u201d And maybe for you it is. Maybe you\u2019re super healthy and you know what? That\u2019s not the stage of life that you\u2019re in.

It\u2019s not lost on us.", "KS: Oh my goodness, Adrian. Now listen, explain how people go through it. I have done it, I can explain it, but I would rather you ...

I\u2019m gonna get you in and out in seven minutes and be done.\u201d But we know people aren\u2019t really dying of rashes that often. We\u2019re dying of the heart diseases, the cancers, etc. And so what we wanted to do was make sure that we take the time to get this full, kind of comprehensive understanding, and we do that in a few different ways.", "The first way after you check in at an iPad, you walk up to a body scanner, it just takes what you would think of as your vitals. And this is your heart rate, your pulse oxymetry, things like that.", "KS: Your height, your weight. It\u2019s cool looking, it\u2019s cool looking.", "Height, weight ... Thank you, but what\u2019s cool about it ...", "LG: Wait, how does the body scanner take your pulse oxymetry? Do you have to put on a finger sensor or something? Interesting.", "You just slide your hand into it, and it takes a bunch of readings. What\u2019s cool about it is, once again, it\u2019s a platform, so we\u2019re constantly trying to add more and more sensors to it. It\u2019s just, again, super inexpensively taking more information. And what\u2019s great about it is, it sends it into exam room for you and the doctor to go over, but it actually also sends it down to your phone. So that you can start to be in control of your information, be empowered. The second step is you walk into that exam room and one of our great medical assistants greets you and we take, typically, blood, and if appropriate, urine, as well as giving you your vaccines.

What\u2019s cool about that is we actually ...", "KS: I do, Travis Kalanick 00:21:11, it\u2019s great. ", "Oh goodness. ", "KS: No, I wouldn\u2019t want that blood.", "Hey, snap with it. ", "KS: All right, focus on Adrian. Go ahead. Aoun.", "What\u2019s cool about it is that we actually have our own blood-processing facilities on site. We take your blood, we take it back and we process it. It\u2019s pretty thorough, it\u2019s your electrolytes, your lipids, your kidney function, liver function, urinalysis, STD testing. And all that sort of stuff ...", "KS: Quickly.", "Yeah, it occurs in about 12 minutes, and the results come right back to the exam room.", "KS: While you\u2019re chit-chatting.", "The way the exam rooms works is pretty cool. There\u2019s this big futuristic fun-looking screen on the wall. It\u2019s got a model of your body and all the data we\u2019ve learned about it is overlaid onto that model. When you doctor is there, they\u2019re kinda helping drive that screen, but it\u2019s a little more of a collaborative experience. Anything you and your doctor are talking about is actually being live represented on the screen, so you can collaboratively build your plans and work together to really make sure it\u2019s personalized ...", "LG: And somebody is listening and typing, right?", "Yeah, exactly.", "KS: Somewhere else.", "We have a scribe that\u2019s basically powering the system. But what\u2019s also cool about it is any sensors we use in the exam room ... Doctors all the time are using sensors. They don\u2019t think of it as such, but that\u2019s what stethoscopes, EKGs, otoscopes, that\u2019s what they are, but all that data is getting lost, and we didn\u2019t like that. In our case our sensors are actually live hooked up to that screen. If they are taking a heart reading, you actually see your heart wave on the screen in real time. Same with things like blood pressure, EKGs, and what\u2019s cool is all that is getting saved into your profile and saved for later whenever the doctor or you want it. Because of course you can access all this on your phone. Once you come up with, \u201cHey, here\u2019s the things I want to focus on,\u201d we\u2019ve screened through head to toe, every single part and really turned over every rock to make sure we understand you ...", "LG: Let me ask about your drinking, drugs, they ask about personal things, stress.", "Absolutely, it\u2019s not just illness. It\u2019s also wellness, which is something I think that we kind of look over a lot in the world of health care.", "KS: Meditation.

We go through things like cancer risk, because that\u2019s super important. We go through wellness, and we just go through your tactical remedies. Are you up to date on all your vaccines? Are you traveling anywhere soon that might need some? What medications are you on? This, that, and the other. So, those kind of four categories we go through. Typically takes about an hour. It can run longer as well. It\u2019s really, really thorough. Because, again, it\u2019s super important we learn about you up front.", "Now, at this point we\u2019ve created with you all the relevant plans. We enroll you into what we think of almost like a curriculum. It\u2019s like, \u201cYou know what, in your case, we really want to focus on your heart risk.\u201d In my family, it turns out, there\u2019s a lot of heart problems. For me, that\u2019s really important. We say, \u201cYou know, we\u2019re going to put that top of mind, top of the list.\u201d And we show you over the course of the coming year, over the course of the next 12 months, these are the things we\u2019re going to work with you on. These are the goals, these are the action items, but also here\u2019s the check-in\u2019s along the way and the metrics that we\u2019re going to measure to ensure that this isn\u2019t a bunch of hand-wavy stuff, that we\u2019re actually getting to success.", "Again, for some people, these things are truly, truly medical. Diabetes management, heart risk. For some people, these things are a little more wellness. \u201cHey, I just want to ... I\u2019m young, I\u2019m healthy, but you know what, I want to run a little faster.\u201d Or the one that it turns out, everybody in this town has stress. ", "KS: Oh no.", "LG: Oh, I manage stress.

Now, is there ...", "KS: I\u2019m not stressed at all.", "LG: Do you offer any type of tier for what you\u2019re pricing? So, for example, if someone didn\u2019t want to pay on a monthly basis, but they wanted to check in four times a year and then they wanted to use apps and wearables to monitor ... Quantify themselves otherwise. ", "That\u2019s a great question. We don\u2019t really think that health care is episodic. I think that\u2019s one of the big mistakes that the existing health-care system has made. That incentivizes a super reactive nature as opposed to a preventative nature. Your body doesn\u2019t stop changing on a daily basis. Your body doesn\u2019t say, \u201cOh, I\u2019m not going to think about health for the next three months, or six months.\u201d Health needs to be something that is a routine, something that is built in to our daily lives. ", "We do that really well, as a society, in some ways. We all brush our teeth a couple times a day. That\u2019s really awesome, because every single day you\u2019ve gotten into the routine of managing the health. But, it turns out that when you think about what\u2019s going on, whether again, it\u2019s your heart, or even your mind. It\u2019s not like, our day is any less stressful ...", "LG: But at the same time, you don\u2019t want everyone to come in all the time, right? You don\u2019t care?", "I actually think about it a little differently. I love when our customers engage their health, using our product. We think that\u2019s fantastic. Our engagement stats are about 7X the normal doctor\u2019s office.", "LG: So they go ... Use it like a ...", "But here\u2019s the cool thing, if I told you you had to come in once a week, personally I\u2019d love it, but you\u2019re not going to do it. You\u2019d get fatigue. So I need to make it really, really easy for you. That\u2019s where the app comes in and that 24/7 team.

Are you keeping up on this thing? On this diet change? Or this exercise? Or maybe you should swing by and get that quick blood test.\u201d We try to really integrate it into your daily life, as opposed to having it be this foreign concept, where once every six months I need to magically remember that I\u2019m supposed to go to the doctor.

", "LG: And I wanted to ask you a question that applies, I guess sort of broadly, to health care in general in the U.S. around the time that you first revealed Forward to the public. It was earlier this year, I believe it was in January. That was around the time the Congressional Budget Office first put out a report saying, \u201cHere\u2019s a number of people who are going to lose insurance.\u201d And it was many millions of people, if the Affordable Care Act, which was introduced by President Obama during his tenure, was repealed.", "Now ultimately we know that recently the Senate voted down to roll back Obamacare. So as it exists right now, things are still in this tenuous place, but the truth of the matter is that you were launching a sort of boutique health care service for people who could afford $149 a month on top of existing health care, at a time when millions of people were about to lose their insurance. How do you think about Forward in the broader landscape of health care in this country and do you want to address that in any way with your business?", "Yeah, I mean first off, would love to address it. That\u2019s what gets us up every morning. The first thing to say is, we get super caught up in what our maybe broken government happens to be doing on any given day, but the truth is that when you zoom out a little and you just look at the magnitude of the problem, all of what\u2019s occurred in the last year is roughly noise. If I look at health care costs in this country over the last, I don\u2019t know, order of 50 years, we\u2019ve gone from 6 percent of GDP to 16 percent of GDP. I mean, it\u2019s just non-tenable.", "To say that this little bill that\u2019s passing or not is the biggest issue that we should focus on just doesn\u2019t seem to make sense, we need to get at the root of the problem. Now, I\u2019ll be the first person to say there\u2019s a reason that Forward didn\u2019t partner with an insurance company from Day One or work with the government. That\u2019s not our expertise. And there\u2019s a lot of people that are working on that, and I\u2019m really happy that they\u2019re doing that, because hopefully we can partner with them.", "There\u2019s some really good and there\u2019s some really bad. The really bad part is that there\u2019s tons and tons of people in this country that are disenfranchised. If we can be a little less myopic, it\u2019s not just this country, it\u2019s all over the planet. And anyways ...", "LG: Right, but in this country, life expectancy for certain groups of people has actually gone down in recent years. Our maternal deaths have gone up more than in other developed countries. This is sad.", "I totally, totally agree, but let\u2019s focus on the good part for a second. The good part is that this is creating a national conversation, and that\u2019s awesome, because you\u2019re starting to see people really, really, really care in a way that they didn\u2019t 20 or 30 years ago.

Really? Calling my Congressman? That\u2019s the solution to the problem? Really?\u201d And so, we wanted to basically say, \u201cMaybe there\u2019s another way. Maybe we should create a conversation in which you\u2019re partnering with folks that are actually building the products that you want.\u201d ", "We see this in tons of industries today.

It\u2019s really interesting, you talking to this. Nobody likes the doctor experience. I don\u2019t think anybody likes it, particularly likes it. It reminds me a little bit of, remember, the taxi experience, it was always bad. Always dirty, always hard to find, and always too expensive. What Uber and Lyft did is they attacked a problem we didn\u2019t know was there until ... You just put up with it, which I think is interesting.", "I agree. Let me push further when you say that\u2019s not the problem to solve. I think that\u2019s the ballgame, because you have to start somewhere. You have to get people understanding, \u201cOh, when I actually engage this, it gets better.\u201d And you start with something like, \u201cWell, let\u2019s not use a cold chair.\u201d But all those tiny little steps lead up to massive change. And it\u2019s not going to be us alone. I don\u2019t think we are the solution to health care\u2019s problems. Everybody that says, \u201cOh, are you going to solve health care?\u201d I think is a little ridiculous and doesn\u2019t understand the magnitude of the problem.", "But I think that when you start to empower people in this country with an ability to actually affect the outcomes, over time all of us working together, the 335 million Americans that care about this, will actually have massive outcomes.

At least that\u2019s what I read on your blog, but in health care, every single player comes up to us and just says, \u201cGreat, let\u2019s work together.\u201d They\u2019re smart, they actually do understand that investing more in preventative care and investing more in primary care is tons ...", "KS: Because I don\u2019t have to pay as much.

All your primary care stuff. We\u2019re a super expansive version of primary care. We do women\u2019s health, we do men\u2019s health, we do a lot of this stuff.

First difference ...", "KS: One Medical is different from traditional care, too though.

Have you ever been in a doctor\u2019s office and they\u2019re typing up notes about you? I always try to look around and look at the notes.

We got a lot of fantastic questions via email from our frequent listener Liz Weeks and unfortunately we do not have time to get to them all, but here are a few of them.", "KS: It\u2019s two, one or two.", "LG: Yeah. So her first question is about, \u201cWhat about dental or oral health? I noticed the emphasis on focusing on systemic root causes for health issues, but Pew has noted the increased need for preventative oral care, especially in rural areas lacking water, etc.\u201d And I don\u2019t know if some of you may remember a story that ran in the Washington Post not long ago. It was a pretty heartbreaking story about thousands of people who were lining up at a gymnasium in Virginia to receive free dental treatments. Just some of their stories, it\u2019s really sad, how people don\u2019t have access to basic dental care in this country.", "First off, awesome question, I love it. The reason that we haven\u2019t gotten into dental yet is not that we don\u2019t want to, we think it\u2019s super, super awesome, there\u2019s two things. One, we haven\u2019t developed game-changing technologies there, and it doesn\u2019t make sense for us to go into something if we don\u2019t have some kind of true novel thing. Turns out there\u2019s some pretty decent dental technologies out there. ", "The second thing is that ... And with all due respect, because it is a big issue for a lot of people, I don\u2019t know that many people that are dying of dental issues. I know a lot of people are dying of cardiovascular issues, of diabetes, this, that and the other, and so we\u2019d prefer to focus on those things much, much more. A lot of the dental issues in the Unites States at least, and I say this with only a cursory understanding, are a lot of cosmetic issues, and those are important and we should deal with those, but on my stack rank, I\u2019d rather solve the heart attack.", "KS: You could specialize.

My mouth is ...", "You have a feeling?", "KS: A filling. That\u2019s why I just said filling because I just had a filling.", "LG: I would argue that even if it\u2019s not life threatening, that someone needing a root canal or having a cavity, or not being able to do their job effectively, or hold down a job effectively. Some people can\u2019t get jobs because they\u2019re missing teeth or whatever it may be. So that\u2019s why I think it\u2019s pretty important. ", "That\u2019s why it\u2019s important, I agree, I totally agree, which is why we want to get to it. We\u2019re not going to ignore it, but in our stack rank it ...", "KS: And in this same question she\u2019s asking about AI machine learning: \u201cLearning is coming to the fore regarding how biased, inappropriate, or flat-out incorrect inputs can completely throw off outputs. How is Forward dealing with this since you have an AI background and how does it intend to deal with issues like liability and malpractice?\u201d", "The way we think about the problem is, all we\u2019re trying to do is learn from our doctors, we\u2019re not trying to bypass the doctors, we\u2019re just trying to make them more efficient. It\u2019s a little like when you are sending a text message on your phone and it kind of fixes your typos or it just fills in the work for you and it just makes you a little more efficient. It didn\u2019t send the text message without you being involved, it just made it a little easier for you. ", "The key in our system is, our doctors are always in control of the care. We don\u2019t bypass the doctors, we don\u2019t overrule the doctors, that\u2019s not how it works. You\u2019ve seen what self-driving cars do when they go wrong, can you imagine what it would be like if your doctor went down that path? We don\u2019t want to go down that any time soon. Maybe in 30 years, come back to me and we\u2019ll have a different conversation about that. ", "But basically, the cool thing about using machine learning and AI is now instead of just seeing one doctor at Forward, think of it as you\u2019re getting a second opinion for free every time, because our technology is basically looking at what all of our doctors have done and say, \u201cOh, this is the part that has worked the best.\u201d And so now our doctors can very easily learn from each other, because the system is saying, \u201cHey, hint hint, this kind of treatment usually works better than this treatment.\u201d And that\u2019s really good. ", "KS: And that is one thing in terms of your files being on paper, there\u2019s so many patterns that should be able to be seen. All right, so next question, Lauren.", "LG: Next question, two questions again from Andrew Porter, @AJMPorter on Twitter: \u201cWith an increasing number of people in favor of a quote unquote universal care, how does a service like this square with that?\u201d", "First off, I love the idea of universal care. That being said, I also don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to get there any time soon in the United States. We\u2019re not trying to build our business for that model, but should that model come out in the United States, we\u2019d be absolutely happy to work within the constraints of that model. It\u2019s a little hard for me to give specifics because it doesn\u2019t exist and there\u2019s not really a serious plan for it to exist. I don\u2019t know if Andrew Porter is working on it, but if he is, God bless him, because I think we should move towards that. ", "LG: The next question, you answered already. An email question from Paul Hippmann: \u201cWhere can laymen access helpful info on new help for heart failure patients, when neither cardiologist nor the media inform them as they do of cancer breakthroughs?\u201d Like a lot of the FitBits, they tried to have more content I know, all of them did. Do you do that?", "We always try and pair something with the doctor. It\u2019s really a key notion for us, is don\u2019t try to bypass doctors, it turns out they\u2019re pretty smart people.

You don\u2019t ever want them to be in control of your health, you want them to almost be your guide or your sherpa through your health.

This actually affects your treatment.\u201d Me, in particular, without getting too much into my medical files, I do have high risk for heart issues. Fairly obvious, probably what I\u2019m going to die from. My 23andMe was like, \u201cBTdubs, you\u2019re going to die of a heart attack, everything else you can ignore.\u201d I spent a lot of time being on top of that research.

I know your prior doctor was awesome but it turns out, that\u2019s now outdated. We shouldn\u2019t keep you on that. So we\u2019re going to switch you from this to this.\u201d He explains it, he explains both the research but also what do we know, but here\u2019s the key, what do we not know. Which traditional care, because you don\u2019t have more than seven minutes, they don\u2019t take the time to tell you, \u201cHey, we know this thing for sure,\u201d versus, \u201cWe might know this, this one\u2019s a little of a crapshoot.\u201d The truth is, again, we\u2019re really early in the science.", "KS: The only thing, of course, is that it\u2019s all subjective.
