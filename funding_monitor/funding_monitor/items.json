He\u2019s in great shape. We put together some demos for him to film it and make a thing out of it. He was a pilot, a commercial pilot, and a pilot in World War II. He flew these supply routes that went from Burma over the high mountains in southeast Asia. It was known to be a pretty dangerous route. If you took the wrong route in the dark, you\u2019d hit a mountain you couldn\u2019t get over. We thought, \u201cHey, we\u2019ll put him in some flight sims and see what he thinks.\u201d", "The one question we asked him was \u2014 he was born in 1917. You\u2019ve seen the advent of television, the advent of computers, the advent of the internet. You\u2019ve seen the advent of commercial flight. So what\u2019s the one technology you think was the biggest thing? You\u2019d think maybe the internet, maybe computers. Maybe that\u2019s my bias because I work at Intel. But he says, \u201cWithout a question, GPS.\u201d As a pilot, seeing the world before and after, that\u2019s the biggest delta.", "GamesBeat: Do you work with ", "Project Alloy", "?", "Pallister:", " The team that worked on that is the other lab down in Santa Clara. They\u2019re the group that worked on all our sensing technologies. It\u2019s a different team, but I work with those guys all the time. We\u2019re trying a lot of different stuff. There are ways they\u2019re related. With Alloy we said, \u201cWe have this great sensing technology. We have this high-performance PC technology. Let\u2019s see how far we can push the envelope of putting it all in one form factor.\u201d", "We realized this is not necessarily the optimal form factor. We learned a lot of things. We think both the inside-out tracking technology and the 3D depth sensing technology are absolutely applicable across a lot of VR areas. But the way we saw the price and performance versus form factor and the fact we were getting increasing confidence on the WiGig side of things \u2014 the best way to deliver a high-performance PC experience is to wirelessly talk to a high-performance PC plugged into a wall outlet.", "GamesBeat: Is the dev kit for Alloy still supposed to come out this year?", "Pallister:", " I think we\u2019ve said we\u2019re not necessarily doing it. We haven\u2019t seen that much interest. All the technologies are still applicable, so we\u2019re looking at ways to deliver those. Guys on my team are taking that same inside-out tracking tech and integrating it into the smartphone demo you saw there. We\u2019re working on that now. The tech is still very much being worked on, but we\u2019ve seen there isn\u2019t necessarily a good fit for bulky-form-factor PC on your head. If you want the PC-quality experience, you\u2019re better off with a full-powered PC and doing it wirelessly.", "All the technology components are still there. But bringing it to market as-is, that was never our intent. It was a proof of concept to try out all these different things. We saw that you don\u2019t want to have the wire and that the PC experience can deliver a more rich experience than what you can deliver on your phone. One way is to say, \u201cHow much PC can we deliver in something you wear on your head?\u201d Another is to say, \u201cHow do I remotely deliver the signal from the PC wirelessly?\u201d The latter turned out to have more legs.", "Above: Intel CEO Brian Krzanich shows off Project Alloy at CES.", "GamesBeat: It seems like more people are still pursuing the stand-alone headsets, though.", "Pallister:", " There are people working on them. Facebook talked about theirs. The Oculus guys talked about theirs. There will be a place for those things. Even putting our position in PCs aside, I think we\u2019re quite a ways off still from people doing enough VR that buying a dedicated appliance that does nothing but VR makes sense.", "You can imagine certain verticals where it makes sense. Something you use in a retail outlet to demo products to people, something like that. But for all these other spaces, whether it\u2019s smartphone based or PC based, you have this Swiss-army-knife platform you use for a bunch of things and therefore, you can justify spending \u2014 what\u2019s Apple charging for the latest phone? $1000? Or you can justify a high-end PC. But are you doing enough VR that you can justify that price? If you can\u2019t, you end up putting less compute in there, and you deliver a less good experience.", "It\u2019s not surprising that people are working on that. I think they\u2019ll have their place. But our bet right now is that the biggest employment you\u2019re going to see with these things is on general-purpose compute platforms, whether it\u2019s a phone at the low end or a high-end PC or something on the spectrum in between.", "GamesBeat: You don\u2019t think there\u2019s too much room for mixed reality, then?", "Pallister:", " That\u2019s a different question. You can do MR or AR or pick your mix of terminology, things along that spectrum. Those will also have ways to do it in a dedicated platform and ways to do it in a general-purpose platform that you\u2019re then either putting into a headset or wirelessly talking to a headset or something.", "An example might be, you already have the ARKit stuff people are doing on phones. One could imagine somebody putting something like that up either on through-the-display AR, or \u2014 people are doing the kind of reflective, \u201cLet\u2019s mount the phone like this with a half-mirror visor.\u201d That\u2019ll be the Google Cardboard, Gear VR approach. Then, there are people already doing PC-connected headsets of some kind, which will then say, \u201cI\u2019ll use this open platform for development and leveraging the compute power there.\u201d You don\u2019t need to do a dedicated device if you\u2019re going to do MR. Certainly, there\u2019s room for it. HoloLens is a great example.", "Above: Lyle Becker tries out VR for the first time.", "GamesBeat: Do you have a road map for the launch at this point?", "Pallister:", " No. What we\u2019ve said is that HTC has announced that they\u2019re doing something. It\u2019s up to them to announce when. They\u2019ve said they\u2019re not saying when yet or how much. We\u2019d like them to say something soon, but they tend to announce things on a very short runway.", "GamesBeat: Obviously the TPCAST is available for pre-orders now.", "Pallister:", " Yeah, it is. We believe the WiGig solution is going to be better. But you guys will have to try it when it comes out.", "GamesBeat: Are you completely in line with the Microsoft MR event?", "Pallister:", " As much as we\u2019re always aligned with Microsoft. We\u2019ve been working really hard with them on a bunch of stuff there. Myself and a number of people went in there a couple of years ago and said, \u201cOK, VR is happening. Where is the DirectX of VR? What are we going to do?\u201d They formulated their plan, and we got behind it in a big way.", "In some ways, what they\u2019re doing is their own offering, very much along the lines of what Oculus or HTC offers. It\u2019s a high-end gaming headset instead of offering single controllers. A thing we\u2019re doing that\u2019s different, they\u2019ve made a deliberate effort to scale down into a set of experiences that will run well on mainstream PCs. That\u2019s something we\u2019ve had whole teams of dedicated engineers working hard on. It\u2019s a collaboration between us doing the right power/performance profiling and custom drivers and optimizations on pieces of code we run and then doing a set of vectors of scalability and different knobs and sliders within their rendering stack and their applications.", "I\u2019m excited about it. We have a bunch of the headsets in-house now. We\u2019ve been using their desktop shell. We have versions of Minecraft running on 15-watt notebooks at full framerate. It\u2019s going to be great.", "GamesBeat: They\u2019ve confused things a bit with the term \u201cmixed reality.\u201d", "Pallister:", " Yeah, as marketing people are sometimes wont to do.", "GamesBeat: We\u2019ve seen some price movement this summer, which is good. It seems like we\u2019re still waiting for the point where it\u2019s in line with other consumer electronics devices \u2014 $299, $399 \u2014 where someone can try out VR, have a great time, and not get hit by sticker shock when they find out how much their own headset would cost.", "Pallister:", " That\u2019s the goal with what we and Microsoft are trying to do. Can you take a sub-$300 headset and say, \u201cThis will work on the notebook you were going to buy, anyway?\u201d You don\u2019t have to change the notebook you were going to buy and get a high-end gaming machine. You can buy the notebook you wanted anyway and have a great set of experiences. If you want to play high-end 3D games, if you want to play Raw Data, then you\u2019ll buy a different machine. If you want to play Minecraft, though, it\u2019s fine."]}

So, did Twilio\u2019s IPO last year raise a broader interest in the sector?", "\u201cIt definitely raised awareness in the U.S. of the cloud communications space as a whole,\u201d explained\u00a0MessageBird\u00a0founder and CEO Robert Vis, in an interview with VentureBeat. \u201cThe uptake we saw was mainly from large enterprises wanting to reach their customers in the greatest possible number of geographies around the world available today.\u201d", "So far, MessageBird has offered a ", "chat API", " for integrating messaging services such as Telegram, Messenger, WeChat, and Line into third-party apps or websites. Its ", "messaging API", " powers SMS-based in-app communications and it\u2019s also working on a video API that\u2019s currently in the final stages of beta testing. With another $60 million in the bank, MessageBird is today officially launching its\u00a0", "voice API", "\u00a0\u2014 which has already been available for several weeks in beta \u2014 to allow businesses to build voice calling into their own services. This is similar to what Twilio has offered for many years already.", "\u201cWe\u2019ve already built the world\u2019s largest and most reliable text message API service for enterprises; now we are raising capital from the two leading investors in Silicon Valley and Europe to expand our voice infrastructure and sell our services into the enterprise market,\u201d said Vis.", "Above: Robert Vis, MessageBird", "For a company that specializes in cloud-based communications, the delay in offering a voice API seems like a huge omission on the surface. Surely, this has significantly hindered MessageBird\u2019s growth so far?", "\u201cIn our case, we saw customers using us for SMS and just not using us for voice because we didn\u2019t offer it before,\u201d said Vis. \u201cThe need for the voice API really is driven by our customers, who wanted us to provide the same global security and cost advantages on voice that we have been doing for SMS for some time now. We are now able to leverage our direct carrier connections on voice as well as SMS. Being bootstrapped teaches you to focus on where the most growth is coming from, and up to now that has always been our SMS products. But the need from our customers was clear \u2014 so we built it.\u201d", "MessageBird claims it has been profitable since its inception and said that it\u2019s on course to hit a $100 million revenue run rate this year. That is pretty impressive. By way of comparison, Twilio had raised north of $100 million in outside funding by the time it was reporting\u00a0", "a $100 million run rate in 2014", ", and this came shortly before it raised ", "an additional $130 million", ".", "MessageBird said that it already counts 15,000 customers globally, including DoorDash, SAP, Huawei, Amber Alert, and Heineken. One particularly notable name in its roster is Uber, which\u00a0Twilio has long claimed as a client of its own.\u00a0", "But Twilio recently revealed", "\u00a0that Uber was reducing its dependency on Twilio\u2019s technology, a move that caused Twilio\u2019s ", "stock to nosedive", ".", "Anyone who\u2019s ever used Uber will likely take for granted the app\u2019s speedy messaging functionality. You\u2019ll also note that it\u2019s possible to chat verbally with a driver through the app, rather than having to share telephone numbers manually over SMS.", "\u201cThe magic of using cloud communications to power this interaction is that both customer and rider are automatically provided with a virtual number, which means both sides of the call are anonymized,\u201d noted\u00a0Vis. \u201cDriver and customer never see each other\u2019s real number.\u201d", "With tens of millions of users globally, such a system requires a reliable infrastructure, and it\u2019s much easier \u2014 even for heavily funded companies such as Uber \u2014 to outsource some of these service, rather than building it all in-house.", "\u201cWe work with large companies that cannot afford compromised communications,\u201d continued Vis. \u201cThe quality of your communications is a direct reflection on the caliber of your business. If you\u2019re on a sales call and that connection is poor, you won\u2019t close the deal. Dropped calls result in missed opportunities and lost business.\u201d", "Another key facet of MessageBird\u2019s business is its carrier partnerships, and the company claims 220 direct carrier integrations globally. With its own telecommunications carrier infrastructure, MessageBird can \u201cconnect to the very core of mobile carriers,\u201d according to Vis. This effectively bypasses legacy systems that may involve multiple players and which may not be reliable. Generally speaking, the more entities involved in getting a message from A to B, the more likely there will be delays or failures. One analogy Vis used to describe its setup is the game \u201ctelephone\u201d (or \u201c", "Chinese whispers", "\u201d as its known elsewhere), whereby a message is whispered into one person\u2019s ear and then passed along to the next person until the last player in the group repeats a message that is unrecognizable to the initial whisper.", "\u201cThe same holds true for communications,\u201d said Vis. \u201cBecause of our direct carrier connections, MessageBird is essentially whispering in the last person\u2019s ear, bypassing all the people in the middle. Other companies go through all those extra hoops, and as a result security is compromised, quality is diminished, and speed is slowed \u2014 and now imagine you had to pay all those people who passed along the message. That is what happens in communications.\u201d", "One interesting facet of MessageBird\u2019s recent past is its participation in the American seed-stage accelerator program, Y Combinator (YC). Though MessageBird was technically a seed-stage company in terms of funding, YC is generally geared toward early-stage startups \u2014 not companies that are already generating millions in revenue. So what was the story behind the YC tie-up?", "\u201cWe were growing so fast that it afforded us a moment to reflect and fine-tune our vision as to where we wanted to go as a company,\u201d Vis said. \u201cIt also provided us with a huge network of portfolio companies we saw as potential customers in the U.S. market. The way I look at YC, it\u2019s more like Harvard for founders, where they really drill you on focus and basics that apply to companies at any stage.\u201d", "One specific learning that Vis gleaned from his company\u2019s involvement with YC was a mantra stipulating that \u201cgrowth\u201d is about retaining customers, not just acquiring them. \u201cIt seems really logical, but it changed the way we looked at customer success, and we increased our revenue expansion rate from 140 percent prior to YC to 170 percent after it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a huge advocate for companies joining YC at any stage, especially larger companies outside of the U.S. wanting to enter the U.S. market.\u201d", "MessageBird now lays claim to the biggest-ever series A investment for a Y Combinator company.", "\u201cWhile many companies have significant traction when they enter YC, MessageBird was one of the largest companies by revenue to ever complete the program,\u201d added\u00a0Y Combinator partner Ali Rowghani.", "Today, MessageBird has offices in its native Amsterdam, as well as in San Francisco, Singapore, and Sydney. In addition to funding its push into voice, the company said it will use its fresh cash bounty to fund new hires, including in customer support, and to consider acquisition options in the U.S., Europe, and Asia.", "One luxury of being a self-funded startup is that you don\u2019t have to worry about exits \u2014 being acquired or going public doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re getting customers and garnering revenue. While this funding helps MessageBird scale in key markets such as the U.S., doesn\u2019t it also give them an extra problem to worry about?", "\u201cWe specifically chose investors who have a long-term vision and will not put pressure on us to think about this [exiting] for a while,\u201d said Vis. \u201cIt happens to be that ", "both investors", " just ", "raised their investment funds", ", so we are good for the next 10 years to not have to worry about this. It\u2019s also super early days for the cloud communication space. This is such a large market \u2014 that is still dominated by incumbents \u2014 that there will be enough time to grow significantly.\u201d"]}
