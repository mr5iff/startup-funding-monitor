# startup-funding-monitor

Perform web scraping on any of the startup funding news sites. Brownie points for scraping Javascript/AJAX based sites that don't load immediately. Just the top few articles is fine. Be careful not to send a whole lot of requests at once. Once you have a few articles, train-test them with some other general articles so that you are able to predict whether a particular article has funding news or not
